Status: The given current structure at iteration : {iteration}/25 did not meet all constraints. Generate a closed 2D truss structure that satisfies the constraints. Current max(abs(stress)) is {c_max_stress} and total mass is {total_mass}.

Inputs:
- Loads: Force information as (node_id: (magnitude, direction)):  {load}
- Supports: Information about supports on nodes {supports}
- node_dict: Node position of current structure {node_dict_c}
- members_dict: Member connection of current structure {member_dict_c}
- area_id: Area ID values to choose cross section from{area_id}
- FEM Results: Fem result of current structure {fem_result}
- Structure Generation History: Ranked Structure-score pair for optimization: {history}

Objectives:
1. Generate the optimal closed truss structure that minimizes stress, while satisfying all given constraints.


Constraints:
1. Max stress (compressive(-) and tensile(+)) <= ±{max_stress}
2. Total mass: Mass (sum of member length × area from {area_id}) <= {max_weight} 

Instructions:

1. Treat this as a single-shot optimization task aimed at resolving constraint violations.
2. Begin with a step-by-step analysis of inputs, current design, and structural generation history. Identify which constraints are violated and why.
3. Use available history, current design, and your structural reasoning to decide whether to improve the existing structure, redesign it, or reuse a historic structure.
4. Prioritize feasibility: Ensure that the final design satisfies all constraints before considering optimization.
5. Design a closed (fully connected) 2D truss — all nodes must be structurally connected, with no isolated nodes.
6. You may add, remove, or fine tune positions of nodes as needed.
7. Plan member connections and node positions to satisfy all constraints and minimize stress.
8. Use precise float values for node coordinates. Avoid rounding or snapping.
9. Use only area_id values from {area_id} as string keys. No duplicates in node or member definitions.
10. Estimate stress and mass using basic structural principles (e.g., static equilibrium, trigonometry). Clearly state any assumptions made.
11. Ensure the final output is a fully consistent and valid Python dictionary.
12. Return only a structure that fully satisfies the constraints and is optimal within your reasoning capability.
13. Do not change or modify node positions with loads or supports.

Output format (python dictionary):
Return a single valid Python dictionary in the format below. Keep all string fields concise. Use floats for coordinates.
