Constraints allow up to 0.75 ratio and max 30 mass, so margin exists to adjust.",\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-15,-30) induces compression in member_1 and tension in member_2. Supports fix node_1 (pinned) and roller supports at node_2 and node_3. Member_5 (node_3-node_4) sized 3 is moderate stress (0.3452). Historical top designs use node_4 around (3.5,3.2) with member_5 area=4; they have higher mass (~28.5) but better ratio (~0.138). Current design slightly lighter but higher ratio. Node_4 adjustment downward reduces height, improving load path. Member_5 increased area reduces stress. Member_6 (base) has area=1; it is underutilized but light. Current member_1 is heavily loaded in compression (area=4).",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "From history, increasing member_5 area lowers stress-to-weight ratio despite higher mass. Node_4 vertical position around 3.2 improves structural efficiency by better triangulation. Current structure can be improved by slightly lowering node_4 to ~3.2, increasing member_5 area to 4 to share load better, and keeping others largely same. This keeps closed truss. Members with low stress (like member_4) can keep small area 2. Node_3 and supports can\'t move; node_4 moved vertically only.",\n    "proposal": "Adopt design from rank_1 with node_4 at (3.5, 3.20), members same except member_5 area increased to \'4\' to reduce stress and improve ratio. This yields stress-to-weight ~0.138 <0.75 and mass ~28.5 <30, satisfying constraints while minimizing ratio.",\n    "reasoning": "Lowering node_4 reduces slenderness and better aligns force paths. Larger member_5 area decreases its stress, sharing load with other members. Maintaining pinned and roller supports fixed preserves boundary conditions. Retaining base member_6 area=1 ensures minimal added mass at bottom chord. Triangulation maintained for stability. This balances mass increase with stress drop for better ratio.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths from node coords: member_1 (node_1-node_3), member_2 (node_3-node_2), member_3 (node_1-node_4), member_4 (node_2-node_4), member_5 (node_3-node_4), member_6 (node_1-node_2). Compute mass = sum(length * area). Estimate stresses based on member forces from load and support reactions solving statics for truss.
