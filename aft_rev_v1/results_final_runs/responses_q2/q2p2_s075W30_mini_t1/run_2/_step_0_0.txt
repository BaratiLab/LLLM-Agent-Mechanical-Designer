  "preamble": "Design a minimally weighted, low-stress closed 2D truss connecting three given nodes with a load at node_3, supports at nodes_1 and 2, optimizing area sizes to minimize max stress/weight ratio while staying within mass and ratio limits.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes at (0,0), (6,0), and (2,0) are colinear. Load at node_3 is (-15 N horizontal, -30 N vertical). Supports are pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 and node_3. The truss must be closed (all nodes connected), minimizing max stress/weight under constraints max ratio ≤0.75 and total mass ≤30. Area IDs reflect cross-sectional areas affecting stress and weight.",
  
  "analysis": "With three colinear nodes, a simple closed truss requires at least one additional node to form a triangle, which gives stiffness and distributes load. Since node_3 bears a downward-left load without vertical reaction support (roller allows vertical movement), vertical load must be transferred to pinned node_1. Node_2 roller supports vertical movement only horizontally. So reaction forces at node_1 are critical. Load path: node_3 transfers load diagonally to node_1 and to node_2. Failure modes: buckling/compression in long horizontal chords; tension in diagonal members. Efficiency prefers short, stiff members with high area in tension and moderate area in compression to minimize mass.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Current nodes colinear: no closed triangle exists. Added node(s) will enable triangulation. Placing a new node above line (0,0)-(6,0) near load (2,0) will form stable triangles. Members node_1-node_new, node_3-node_new, node_2-node_new to close truss and efficiently transfer load. The new node must be optimally located to minimize member length while distributing the load effectively.",
  
  "reasoning": "Add node_4 at approximately (2.0, 2.5) to form an isosceles triangle with base node_1-node_2. Connect node_4 with nodes 1, 2, 3 creating a two-triangle closed truss: (1-4-3) and (2-4-3). This triangulation effectively transfers the vertical load at node_3 through two diagonals. Use larger areas on diagonals under tension to reduce stress. The horizontal member node_1-node_2 can be thinner (area 1 or 0.195) as it mainly resists compression/minor tension. This approach distributes forces, limits maximum stress, and respects mass constraints.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Truss members behave as axial elements. Calculate length of each member and use areas to find mass. Calculate forces by static equilibrium at nodes. Use direction cosines for force decomposition. Apply modulus proportionality: cross-sectional area reduces stress. Calculate stress = force/area, max absolute stress determines ratio with total weight.\nMembers:\nm1: node_1-node_2 (length=6m approx),\nm2: node_1-node_4,\nm3: node_2-node_4,\nm4: node_3-node_4,\nm5: node_1-node_3.\nChoose area_id {0.195, 0.782, 1.759} for diagonals fine-tuning loads and minimizing mass.\nCalculate member lengths, total mass = sum(length*area).
