  "preamble": "Current truss has 4 nodes with 6 members and satisfies constraints at iteration 5/25 with stress-to-weight ratio 0.1383. Objective is to minimize stress-to-weight ratio under given boundary conditions, loads, supports, and mass constraint.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "The current design is a 4-node truss with members connecting base nodes and an apex, load applied at node_3 with pinned and roller supports at base nodes. Constraints limit mass to 30 and max stress-to-weight ratio to 0.75. Current best ratio is ~0.1383, well within limits.",
  "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-15, -30) induces compression in members connected to node_1 and tension in members towards node_2 and node_4. Structure is statically determinate with pinned and roller supports. Largest stress found in member_1 (compressive). Member_5 connecting node_3 to node_4 carries little stress, hence potential for area optimization. Generation history shows slight node repositioning affects mass and stresses but topologies are similar. No constraint violations. Current design topology uses two triangles sharing node_4 to distribute load. Member lengths and areas lead to total mass ~28.5, just below limit.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Members with low stress and high mass (like member_5) appear inefficient. Node_4 vertical position at 3.20 helps triangulate, but slight vertical shift may redistribute stress more evenly and allow smaller areas. The base nodes are fixed by supports and the loaded node cannot move. The top node_4 can be fine-tuned vertically or slightly horizontally to improve geometry. Member_6 is shortest and lightest with smallest area, a good baseline. Area assignment is logical with 4 as max areas on critical members. History suggests areas '4' and '2' are effective for stress handling.",
  "proposal": "Retain all nodes and member topology to preserve boundary conditions and connectivity. Slightly raise node_4 vertically (from 3.20 to ~3.35) to improve triangulation and reduce compressive stresses on member_1 and member_6. Reduce area of low-stress member_5 from '4' to '3' area to save mass without increasing max stress. Possibly reduce area of member_3 or member_4 if stress is very low there. Maintain members connected to node_3 and adjust areas to balance stress and minimize mass.",
  "reasoning": "Strut elements handle compression, ties handle tension. Load downward and leftward at node_3 requires compression member (member_1) to be strong. Triangle formed by node_3, node_4 and node_1 will provide rigidity. Increasing vertical height of node_4 increases inclination, reducing compression in member_1 and member_6, redistributing stress to member_5 and member_4. Reducing area in less stressed members reduces mass, improving stress-to-weight ratio. Symmetry in base nodes maintained by fixed positions. Member selection follows member stiffness-area considerations aligned with stress demand.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths between nodes for new node_4 position: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(3.5,3.35). Compute lengths and resulting stresses proportionally based on load and trigonometric functions. Areas to be assigned from set: '1':0.195, '2':0.782, '3':1.759, '4':3.128. Estimate mass = sum(length * area). Evaluate max stress based on load and member geometry. Check stress-to-weight ratio <= 0.75 and total mass <= 30. Iterate areas for members 3,4,5 to minimize mass without violating stress constraints.",
  "calculation": "Lengths: member_1 (node_1-node_3): 2.0, member_2 (node_3-node_2): 4.0, member_3 (node_1-node_4): sqrt((3.5)^2 + (3.35)^2)=~4.85, member_4 (node_2-node_4): sqrt((2.5)^2 + (3.35)^2)=~4.19, member_5 (node_3-node_4): sqrt((1.5)^2 + (3.35)^2)=~3.67, member_6 (node_1-node_2): 6.0.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Assign areas: member_1: '4' (3.128), member_2: '2' (0.782), member_3: '2' (0.782), member_4: '2' (0.782), member_5: '3' (1.759), member_6: '1' (0.195).
