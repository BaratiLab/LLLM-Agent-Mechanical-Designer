The design must be fully connected and closed to resist the load at node_3.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes are: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Load at node_3 is (-15 N, -30 N) downward-left. node_1 pinned, node_2 and node_3 rollers. Constraints: stress/weight ≤ 0.75, mass ≤ 30. Minimal nodes, need closed truss—must add at least one node and triangulate for rigidity. Aim for triangulation of the three points plus additional node to avoid slack member and reduce max stress.",\n\n  "analysis": "Load acts mainly downward-left at node_3 on the horizontal baseline between nodes 1 and 2. Pinned at node_1 restrains horizontal and vertical, roller at node_2 restrains vertical, roller at node_3 restrains vertical. The direct baseline members node_1-node_2 and node_1-node_3 + node_2-node_3 can form basic triangles but may be insufficient. Adding a new node elevated above the baseline near node_3 creates a truss configuration to distribute forces effectively. Without triangulation, large stress in members spanning node_3, so adding node_4 above node_3 reduces stress by stiffening structure and creating two triangles. Use areas chosen to minimize weight but carry forces safely.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a single new node approximately above node_3 at around x=2.0, y=3.5 (roughly half total height) creates two triangles: node_1-node_4-node_3 and node_2-node_4-node_3. This distributes forces from the inclined load. Member areas can be chosen from the given options to keep mass ≤30 but sufficiently strong. We must avoid large tensile or compressive stresses. Baseline node_1-node_2 remains for closing the truss shape. This satisfies \'closed\' with a quadrilateral shape triangulated by node_4.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Introduce node_4 at (2.0, 3.50) for vertical triangulation. The four nodes form a trapezoidal truss with diagonals sharing the load. Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_3-node_1, node_3-node_2, node_2-node_4, node_1-node_2. Assign smaller area (0.782) to baseline and node_3 connected members, larger areas (3.128 to 7.037) to diagonal members handling load. This balances member stiffness and weight. Triangles created enhance stability, reduce maximum stresses, and improve load path directly to node_1 pinned support.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic behavior, truss members carry axial loads only. Calculate length for each member: dist between nodes. Use equilibrium equations at nodes to find member axial forces. Calculate approximate stress = Force / Area (area from area_id). Calculate weight = sum(length × area). Calculate max(abs(stress))/weight. Choose area ids iteratively to meet stress and mass constraints. Members and lengths to consider: (node_1,node_2), (node_1,node_3), (node_3,node_2), (node_1,node_4), (node_4,node_3), (node_2,node_4).
