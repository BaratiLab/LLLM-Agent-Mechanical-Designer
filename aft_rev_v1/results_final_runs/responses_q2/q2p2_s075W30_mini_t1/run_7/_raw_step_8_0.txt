The current structure meets constraints but has a stress-to-weight ratio of 0.7332. The objective is to minimize this ratio ≤0.75 while maintaining mass ≤30 and a closed truss topology.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "The structure is small, with 4 nodes and members connecting base points and an upper node. Loads act downward and leftward on node_3. Supports are fixed at node_1 and rollers at node_2 and node_3. Current mass ~19.5 and max stress near 14.3. Previous best solutions show improved ratios near 0.352 using area distribution and slight node elevation changes.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current design has member_3 near max stress (-14.29) and low area (area_id \'1\'). Members running along base and upper node form triangles, providing stiffness. History shows improvement by elevating node_4 (2.85 to near 3.0) and increasing area for base member_1 from \'2\' to \'3\' reduces max stress and distributes load better, lowering max stress to ~7.0 and improving stress-to-weight ratio. Member masses shift accordingly but stay within mass limit. Current design has redundant heavier members with higher stresses. Load path is from node_3 load to supports via node_4 and base members. Increasing upper node height slightly improves load transfer and reduces bending moments. Constraints are met by historic structures with node_4 near 3.0 and area distributions favoring larger area for long base member_1 to reduce stress, but keep others lighter.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Pattern: Higher top node (node_4 ~ 3.0) and stronger base member_1 (area_id \'3\') reduce stress and improve ratio. Members connected to node_3 benefit from lighter area (\'1\') for lower mass while maintaining strength. History confirms minimal stress-to-weight ~0.3525 with total mass ~20. This is significantly better than current 0.7332. Constraints not violated. No topology changes seen in ranked history; triangulation maintained. Improvement likely from node_4 elevation and member area redistribution rather than drastic node repositioning. Concentrating on topology preservation and fine-tuning node_4 upwards with member areas based on history is optimal.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Adopt the historic best structure with node_4 elevated to 2.95 and members area distribution: member_1 = \'3\', member_2 = \'3\', member_3 = \'1\', member_4 = \'1\', member_5 = \'1\'. Keep nodes with loads and supports fixed. This structure has the best recorded stress-to-weight ratio (~0.3524) and respects constraints. Keep base nodes unchanged and elevate only node_4 to 2.95 for optimal load distribution and minimal mass increase.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Elevating node_4 distributes vertical and horizontal forces more effectively, reducing peak stress in members. Increasing area of critical long base member_1 reduces stress concentrations while keeping other members lighter saves mass. Triangulation preserved ensures structural stiffness. Supporting a distributed load at node_3 through node_4 and the base members reduces bending and tensile stresses. Using area_id selection from available discrete values aligns with known optimal solutions in history. Avoid node movement at load/support points preserves boundary conditions and load paths.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic members, uniform material properties, stress proportional to member force/cross-sectional area, member length from Euclidean distances. \\\nMember mass computed as length × area constant (from area_id mapping).
