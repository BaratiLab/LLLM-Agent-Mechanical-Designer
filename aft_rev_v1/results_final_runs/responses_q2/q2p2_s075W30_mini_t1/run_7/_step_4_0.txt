    "preamble": "The current truss structure fails constraints with a high stress-to-weight ratio (1.5211) well above the limit 0.75, and total mass is moderate (10.2622 < 30). The objective is to design a fully connected, closed 2D truss with optimized node positions and member sizing to reduce the stress-to-weight ratio below 0.75 while maintaining total mass under 30, respecting supports and load constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "The truss has 4 nodes with a load of (-15, -30) on node_3. Supports are pinned on node_1, rollers on node_2 and node_3. The existing structure has a vertical node_4 causing high stresses on member_2 and member_5. Member areas vary from 1 to 2 in area_id but max stress still exceeds allowable limits leading to high stress-to-weight ratio.",

    "analysis": "The load at node_3 is downward-left and moderate magnitude. Supports prevent horizontal and vertical movement at node_1 and vertical movement at node_2 and node_3. The current 5-member structure is a quadrilateral with a diagonal node_4 above the baseline, forming triangles. High tensile/compressive stresses occur mainly at members connected to node_3 and node_2. The lightest members (area 1 or 2) are overstressed, indicating undersizing or poor load path. Historical better designs have node_4 positioned closer to node_2 horizontally and a higher area member_2 (area_id '3') but mass rises then. Triangulation is good but members near loaded node_3 need strengthening and node_4 repositioning to optimize force flow and reduce member length and thus mass.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Increasing member area near node_3 reduces stresses but increases mass. Moving node_4 slightly to the right and lowering it towards node_2 improves load transfer. Area id '3' seems necessary for main chords. The previous best designs used area 3 on members 1 and 2, smaller areas on diagonals. Aim to balance member sizing for low mass and acceptable stress. The load on node_3 induces bending and axial tension/compression in members 2 and 5 – increasing these members' area reduces stress. Node_3 and node_2 are rollers; node_1 fully fixed, so reactions there can carry forces efficiently.",

    "proposal": "Use historic structure with node_4 repositioned to (4.0, 3.0) as this was top ranked, with adjustments: Use area '3' on main chords (members 1 and 2), and area '1' on diagonals (members 3,4,5). Maintain node_1, node_2, node_3 positions due to loads/supports. This should bring stress-to-weight ratio well below 0.75 as historically recorded, with feasible total mass.",

    "reasoning": "Triangular configurations ensure rigidity and force distribution. Node_4 elevated above baseline at (4.00, 3.00) creates stable triangular geometry with members 1,3,4,5. Using area_id '3' (1.759) on main horizontal members increases cross-section and reduces max stress. Smaller areas on diagonals minimize mass. This arrangement balances forces from node_3 load across node_2 and node_1, minimizing peak stresses. The improved geometry shortens critical members compared to prior wider node_4 positions, reducing mass.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Member length based on Euclidean distance between nodes. Member mass = length × area (area from area_id). Stress proportional to force/cross sectional area. Stress-to-weight ratio ≈ max force divided by total weight. Using member 1 and 2 areas=1.759, diagonals=0.195; lengths approx: m1~6.00, m2~4.00, diagonals ~4.9,3.0,2.5. Calculate total mass ≈16-20 with these. Max stress under 7 based on historical results. This is under the 0.75 ratio bound given mass ~20 => max stress max allowed ~15, achieved ~7. Justify design choices accordingly.",

    "calculation": "Member lengths: m1 (node_1-node_2):6.00, m2 (node_2-node_3):4.00, m3 (node_1-node_4):5.00, m4 (node_4-node_2):2.23, m5 (node_4-node_3):2.83. Member areas: m1,m2=1.759; m3,m4,m5=0.195 mass=(6*1.759)+(4*1.759)+(5*0.195)+(2.23*0.195)+(2.83*0.195)= (10.554+7.036+0.975+0.435+0.552)=19.55 < 30 constraint met. Estimated max stress ~7, stress-to-weight=7/19.55=0.36 < 0.75 constraint met. Closed truss. All nodes connected. Members sized to balance mass and stress.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "Final structure meets support/load constraints, stresses below limits, total mass < 30, and stress-to-weight ratio < 0.75. Node_1, node_2, node_3 retained per instruction to not move load/support nodes. Node_4 positioned at (4.00, 3.00) to optimize load path and minimize mass. Member areas assigned based on historical high ranking: main chords with area_id '3', diagonals with area_id '1'. Fully connected closed truss with 5 members. No excessive mass or stress. No unsupported or isolated nodes. Ready to output final design.",
