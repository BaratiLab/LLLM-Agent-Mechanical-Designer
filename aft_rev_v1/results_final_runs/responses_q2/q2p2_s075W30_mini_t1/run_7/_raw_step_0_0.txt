Design aims to meet stress-weight and total mass constraints while ensuring structural connectivity and stability.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "The problem has 3 nodes on the x-axis at 0,0; 2,0; and 6,0. Load at node_3: magnitude 15 units, direction 30° below horizontal left. Supports: pinned at node_1, roller at node_2 and node_3. Objective: minimize max stress/weight ≤0.75 and total mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Given horizontal node arrangement, unbraced 3-node line is unstable under load. Closed truss requires additional nodes and members creating triangulation. Load on node_3 is downward and left-angled force causing bending moment and axial forces in members. Supports fix node_1 fully, node_2 and node_3 rollers restrict vertical motion only. Likely high bending stress in base members without triangulation. To reduce stress and weight, introduce minimal diagonal bracing forming two triangles linking node_1, node_2, node_3 and an added node above to lift load path.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Key insight: vertical and diagonal bracing reduces bending, transfers load as primarily axial forces. Adding one node above at approx midpoint x=4.0, y=3.0 creates a stable two-triangle truss shape, distributing load efficiently. Member lengths and areas can then be sized to satisfy constraints. Roller at node_3 allows vertical displacement hence diagonal tie needed there.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (4.0, 3.0) to form closed triangles: (node_1, node_4, node_3) and (node_2, node_4, node_3). Members: base members (node_1-node_2, node_2-node_3), diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_4-node_3). By sizing diagonal members with small area (area_id=\'1\') and base members with medium area (area_id=\'3\') we achieve a balance of stiffness and weight. Triangulated load path reduces max stress, ensuring max stress/weight ratio ≤0.75 and total mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assume unit force/material properties proportional to area_id. Compute member lengths by distance formula. Force equilibrium at nodes for horizontal and vertical. Use trigonometry to resolve components. Mass = sum(length * area value). Estimate maximum axial force as load magnitude distributed via member orientation. Calculate stress proportional to force/area for each member. Check constraints; adjust member areas if needed.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1(0.0,0.0), node_2(6.0,0.0), node_3(2.0,0.0), node_4(4.0,3.0). Lengths(m): n1-n2=6.00, n2-n3=4.00, n1-n4≈4.47, n4-n2≈3.61, n4-n3≈3.61. Area assignments: base members(node_1-node_2, node_2-node_3)=area_id \'3\' (1.759), diagonals=area_id \'1\' (0.195). Mass ≈ (6*1.759 + 4*1.759 + 4.47*0.195 + 3.61*0.195 +3.61*0.195)= sum ≈ 10.55 +7.036 + 0.87 +0.704+0.704 = 19.864 < 30.
