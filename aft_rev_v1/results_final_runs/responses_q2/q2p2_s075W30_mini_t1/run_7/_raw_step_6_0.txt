Optimization objective is a closed 2D truss that meets max stress-to-weight ≤ 0.75 and total mass ≤ 30 with minimal weight and balanced stress distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Current load: node_3 with (-15.0, -30.0). Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 and node_3 rollers. Node_4 elevated in y (3.15 approx) acting as top node. Members mostly short chord members with varying cross-sections. Previous attempts show stress concentrations up to 16.12 and mass ~11.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 is large downward and leftward. Node_3 is roller support, causing vertical reactions only at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller. Existing design has long member_2 with max stress close to yield (0.0545) but thin member_1 highly stressed (-16.1213). Most mass concentrated in member_2 (7.036 units mass). The structure is not fully optimized with eccentric load path causing high stress in member_1. The history shows better stress ratio (~0.3525) in designs that use \'member_1\' connecting node_1 to node_2 directly with large cross-section \'3\'. Those structures have symmetric triangulation and stiffer chords, but at cost of slightly higher mass (~20).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Symmetry and triangulation improve stress distribution and reduce peaks. Higher cross-section in chord members reduces stress and allows load transfer efficiently. Current asymmetric designs with thin member_1 create high stress concentrations. Reducing load eccentricity by triangulating top node with stiffer chords improves performance. Current mass under 30 allows cross-section increase for safety.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Reuse best topology from history ranked #1 with minor node reposition to slightly reduce height from 3.0 to 2.95m to lower bending moment and redistribute load better. Use cross-section \'3\' for chords (node_1-node_2 and node_2-node_3) for stiffness, and minimum cross-section \'1\' for diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_4-node_3). Keep node_3 fixed since it has load and support. This creates a fully triangulated, closed truss satisfying constraints with stress-to-weight ratio ~0.3525 and mass ~20 < 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangulation with top node (node_4) connecting lower nodes forms two triangles sharing node_4, distributing load paths. Larger area in chords improves axial capacity reducing stress. Height adjustment improves load distribution (reducing top node lever arm) without increasing mass significantly. Supports remain unchanged preserving boundary conditions. Cross-section selection balances stress and mass to satisfy ≤0.75 stress-to-weight ratio.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Uniform material with stress proportional to force/area. Member length calculated via node distance. Mass computed as sum(length * area). Load balances give reaction forces at supports and member axial forces. Estimated max stress from history data scaled by area and length changes. Calculation verifies max stress (~7.04) less than area capacity (area \'3\' = 1.759) and mass below 30.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Lengths: node_1-node_2 = 6.0m, node_2-node_3=4.0m, node_1-node_4= sqrt(4.0^2 + 2.95^2)=4.97m, node_4-node_2=sqrt(2.0^2 + 2.95^2)=3.54m, node_4-node_3=sqrt(2.0^2 + 2.95^2)=3.54m. Mass = 6*1.759 + 4*1.759 + 4.97*0.195 + 3.54*0.195 + 3.54*0.195 ≈ 19.97 ≤ 30. Max stress ≈ 7.04 from history with this topology and sizing, so stress-to-weight < 0.75.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_final": "Final structure is symmetric, triangulated, fully connected with loads and supports fixed.
