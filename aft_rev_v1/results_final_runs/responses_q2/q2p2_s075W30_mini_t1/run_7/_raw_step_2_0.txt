The optimization objective is to design a closed truss that satisfies all constraints by reducing max stress relative to weight, and keeping mass under 30, while retaining supports and load positions.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given load at node_3 is (-15.0, -30.0), supports at node_1(pinned), node_2(roller) and node_3(roller), and nodes mostly on x-axis except node_4 above, with members connecting nodes mostly triangular except for a long base member_1. Constraints fail due to high stresses on members 1 and 2 and excessive stress-to-weight ratio.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 induces strong compression/tension in members to supports. Current members member_1(node_1-node_2, area 2) and member_2(node_2-node_3, area 2) face highest stresses (±14.6). The horizontal base line may cause high bending and stress concentration as node_3 lies between node_1 and node_2 on x-axis and carries load downward. The history structure with node_4 at (4.0, 3.0) and larger cross-sectional areas (3) at members 1 and 2 reduced stress-to-weight to 0.35 but doubled mass to ~20. To reduce stress-to-weight and maintain mass ≤ 30, a design combining a small, stable triangulated shape is needed with thicker members where forces concentrate, and smaller members elsewhere. The open truss base can be converted into closed triangular loops with members connecting the loaded node_3 directly to node_1 and node_2 and node_4 optimized near load but raised slightly for better load paths and triangulation. Roller on node_3 allows horizontal displacement, so internal forces must be well balanced to avoid excess stress.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation to distribute forces and thicker base members are key. Current low area on node_4 related members caused high stress on base. Raising node_4 and enlarging critical members can reduce stresses. Avoid long flat horizontal members under tension. Large member areas on base members increase mass but improve stress-to-weight ratio. Aim for area id 3 on base members and id 1 on diagonals minimizes mass and stress.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Adopt the best historic structure from history with node_4 at (4.00, 3.00), using area_id \'3\' on base members (node_1-node_2 and node_2-node_3) and area_id \'1\' on diagonal members (node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_4-node_3). This design forms two triangular loops with triangulation ensuring structural stability, good load paths and reduced max stress-to-weight ratio within 0.75 and total mass approximately 20, well below max 30. Node positions with supports and load unchanged.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Using larger cross-sectional areas on base members handling large horizontal and vertical forces from load at node_3 reduces stress. Diagonal bracing with smaller areas reduces mass but maintains rigidity. Node_4 positioned above the base line forms two triangles supporting load at node_3 via node_4 and node_2, distributing forces. Pinned and roller supports maintain boundary conditions allowing expected deformation under load without overconstraint. This closed truss minimizes stress concentration and mass while satisfying constraints.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: direct tension/compression in members, uniform stress distribution, linear elastic behavior. Calculate member lengths via Euclidean distance. Member force estimates from load distribution and triangulation. Mass = sum(member length × area_id value). Max stress estimated from member force divided by member area proportional to area_id. Area values chosen from {\'0\':1, \'1\':0.195, \'2\':0.782, \'3\':1.759} to balance strength and weight.
