  "preamble": "Designing a minimal stress-to-weight ratio closed truss for 3 ground nodes with given loads and support conditions. Objective is to minimize max(abs(stress))/total_weight ≤ 0.75 while total mass ≤ 30, using given area profiles. Structure must be fully connected and stable under given loads.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes: node_1(0,0, pinned), node_2(6,0, roller), node_3(2,0, roller) with load (-15, -30) at node_3. Initial challenge: all nodes on x-axis line (colinear), so truss must be expanded with new nodes off-axis for triangulation and closure. No members given yet, must generate fully connected closed truss. Constraints on mass and stress ratio set limits on member areas and lengths.",
  
  "analysis": "Load at node_3 downward and leftward. node_1 fixed pinned prevents all translation; node_2 roller allows horizontal movement only. Members must transfer load from node_3 to supports, needing vertical and horizontal bracing. A simple triangle between node_1, node_2, node_3 is impossible (colinear nodes). Introducing one new node off the x-axis forms a triangular truss. Triangulation provides static determinacy and minimal member number for stability. Focus on minimal length (lightweight) but enough area for stress reduction. Stress proportional to load / cross-sectional area. Use smaller areas for shorter members, larger areas for longer tensile/compressive members.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a fourth node above the x-axis near node_3 (e.g., at (2,4)) allows forming two triangles: node_1-node_4-node_3 and node_3-node_4-node_2. Both triangles stable, forming closed and triangulated truss. Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_3-node_2, plus base member node_1-node_2 for closure. This ensures all nodes connected. Using areas increasing with member length: shorter members get smaller areas, longer members get bigger areas but capped so total weight ≤30. Load paths optimized by having node_4 directly above load node_3 to efficiently transfer vertical and horizontal loads to supports.",
  
  "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (2.00, 4.00) to create two key triangles transforming the linear system into a stable 2D truss. Connect members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_2. This forms a closed loop and distributes loads efficiently. Use area_id '3' (1.759) for longer members, '1' (0.195) for short members, limiting total mass and stress. Pin support at node_1 reacts to both directions, roller at node_2 and node_3 mainly vertical or horizontal as per roller constraints. This layout minimizes length sum and distributes forces, reducing max stress.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic, equal modulus for all members. Stress = Force / Area. Estimate member forces by static equilibrium at node_3 and node_4. Mass = Sum(length * area_id_value). Member lengths from distance formula. Use trigonometry for force components. Calculate tension/compression forces, verify maximum absolute stress, compute stress-to-weight ratio. Iterate area selection to meet constraints. Members: 1-2,1-4,4-3,3-2. Node_4 at (2.00,4.00).",
  
  "calculation": "Lengths: 1-2 = 6.0 m, 1-4 = sqrt((2-0)^2+(4-0)^2)=4.472 m, 4-3 = sqrt((2-2)^2+(4-0)^2)=4.0 m, 3-2 = 4.0 m. Select areas: 1-2: '2'(0.782), 1-4: '1'(0.195), 4-3: '3'(1.759), 3-2: '1'(0.195). Mass = 6*0.782 + 4.472*0.195 + 4*1.759 + 4*0.195 = 4.692 + 0.872 + 7.036 + 0.780 = 13.38 < 30. Load at node_3 is -15 i and -30 j (kN). Force resolution by static diagram: members 4-3 and 3-2 carry main vertical load, 1-4 and 1-2 carry horizontal reactions. Force magnitudes estimated by equilibrium (sum Fx =0, sum Fy=0): node_3: T_4-3 vertical approx 30 kN tension (due to vertical load), member 3-2 in tension ~15 kN horizontal. Calculate stresses: stress_4-3 = 30/1.759=17.06, stress_3-2=15/0.195=76.92 (excessive), stress_1-4 = reaction ~16 kN/0.195=82 kN (high), stress_1-2=horizontal ~15 kN/0.782=19.17. Maximum stress dominates by smaller area members. Adjust 1-4 and 3-2 areas up to '3'(1.759) at 1-4, '2'(0.782) at 3-2: stresses reduce to roughly 16/1.759=9.1 and 15/0.782=19.18. Total mass updates to ~19.05. Max stress ~19.18. Stress-to-weight ratio = 19.18 / 19.05 = 1.006 >0.75. Increase 3-2 to '4'(3.128) area: stress = 15/3.128=4.79. Mass = 6*0.782+4.472*1.759+4*3.128+4*1.759=4.692 + 7.865 +12.512 +7.036=32.105 >30 mass limit. Adjust down 1-4 to '2'(0.782). Mass=6*0.782 +4.472*0.782 +4*3.128 +4*1.759=4.692 + 3.498 +12.512 +7.036 =27.74 <30; max stress now 4.79 (3-2), 15/0.782=19.18(1-4) - we must swap areas 1-4 and 3-2; 1-4 area '4'(3.128) to reduce to 5 kN stress, 3-2 area '2'(0.782) =19.18. Total mass slightly higher ~28.5. Max stress now at 3-2=19.18 still high. Increase 3-2 to '3'(1.759), mass=6*0.782+4.472*3.128+4*1.759+4*1.759=4.692+13.985+7.036 +7.036=32.7 >30. Alternatively, increase node_2 roller to pinned to allow load redistribution could help, but not allowed. Optimal compromise: 1-2:'2'(0.782),1-4:'4'(3.128),4-3:'3'(1.759),3-2:'2'(0.782). Mass=4.692+13.985+7.036+3.145=28.86. Max stress=15/0.782=19.18 (3-2), so stress-to-weight=19.18/28.86=0.66 <0.75 constraint. Satisfied.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Final structure uses 4 nodes, fully connected closed loop: members 1-2,1-4,4-3,3-2. Node_4 at (2,4) provides stability and load path. Areas chosen to satisfy mass <30 and max stress/weight ≤0.75. No duplicates or disconnected members. All inputs respected. Coordinates precise to 1e-2. Ready for output.",
