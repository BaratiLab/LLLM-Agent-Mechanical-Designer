Objective is to redesign a fully triangulated closed truss under same loading/supports, minimizing stress-to-weight ratio and keeping mass <= 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 is (-15, -30) kN, supported at node_1 pinned, node_2 and node_3 rollers. Current masses and stresses show members 1 and 4 carry large axial forces causing max stress. History shows lower top node height (3.5) with thinner members in verticals reduces stress-to-weight ratio to 0.3878 with mass ~19.05. Current design at height 3.75 with thicker vertical members increases mass and stress ratio above limit.",\n  "analysis": "The load at node_3 creates tension in member_4 (node_3-node_2) and compression in member_1 (node_1-node_2). Current verticals (member_2, member_3) carry no stress, indicating poor load path. History rank_1 design uses area_id \'1\' (0.195) for verticals and \'3\' (1.759) for horizontals with node_4 at y=3.5, achieving best stress-to-weight ratio of 0.3878 and total mass 19.05 (under 30). The current design’s verticals with area_id \'3\' increase mass without improving load path. Also, horizontal member area could be slightly increased to reduce stress but at cost of mass. The structure is a trapezoidal truss with two supports on ground and one roller on loaded node; proper triangulation counteracts bending moments effectively. Absence or zero stress in verticals indicates load bypassed these members, so reducing their areas or changing geometry to enforce stress distribution can optimize mass and ratio.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "The prior best design (rank_1) has node_4 at y=3.5 with small areas in verticals and larger in horizontals, showing effective triangulation. The load is resolved into compression and tension in horizontal chords with stiff slender verticals balancing forces. Using the same node locations but thinner vertical members will reduce mass and stress-to-weight ratio. Increasing height helps but must keep vertical members efficient. Member cross-sectional areas must be balanced: too large masses increase weight; too small cause high stress. Retaining fixed load/support nodes limits node movement. Closed truss with node connections forming two triangles (node_1-node_4-node_3 and node_4-node_3-node_2) is optimal.",\n  "proposal": "Adopt the historic best design with minor adjustments: keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed; set node_4 at (2.0, 3.5). Set vertical members (member_2 and member_3) to area_id \'1\' (0.195) to reduce mass whilst maintaining structural stiffness. Use horizontal members (member_1 and member_4) area_id \'3\' (1.759) for load bearing capacity. This achieves stress-to-weight ratio below 0.75 and total mass under 30 while maintaining closed, triangulated truss structure.",\n  "reasoning": "Triangulated closed truss with two triangles resists load effectively. Lower height (from 3.75 to 3.5) reduces member length and mass slightly. Verticals with small cross-section carry forces in compression/tension helping transfer loads between chords. Larger horizontal area resists bending and stress. Load is split between tension (lower chords) and compression (upper chords). Using rank_1 structure\'s node positions and areas takes advantage of proven optimal design. Load path ensures all members are stressed, avoiding zero-stress members (wasted mass). This balances mass and maximum stress, satisfying constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic axial force balance, symmetrical load paths, area-mass proportionality from given area_id map. Calculate member lengths: member_1 (node_1-node_2) = 6.0m, member_2 (node_1-node_4) = 3.5m, member_3 (node_4-node_3) ≈ 3.54m, member_4 (node_3-node_2) = 4.0m. Mass = sum(length × area).
