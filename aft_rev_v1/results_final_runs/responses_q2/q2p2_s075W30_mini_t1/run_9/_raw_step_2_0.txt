The optimization goal is to generate a feasible closed 2D truss minimizing the stress-to-weight ratio while adhering to mass ≤ 30 and maintaining fixed supports and load nodes.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Initial objectives: reduce max stress relative to weight to ≤ 0.75 by changing geometry and member sizes. Constraints require a closed truss connecting all four nodes with no isolated members. Node positions with loads/supports must remain fixed. History shows a prior feasible structure with 0.5758 ratio but very high mass (28.8). Current low mass design has high stress-to-weight ratio, indicating undersized or insufficient triangulation.",\n  "analysis": "Current structure is a trapezoidal shape: a bottom chord between nodes 1-2 (area_id \'2\'), vertical members 1-4 and 4-3 with very small areas (\'1\'), and bottom chord 3-2 with area \'2\'. Load on node 3 is large and diagonal (-15, -30), inducing bending and large stresses in members 1 and 4, which are minimal area. This causes stress concentration and high ratio. The previous feasible design increased vertical member areas (\'4\' and \'3\'), raising mass but improving load path via stiffer triangulation. The current design\'s low member areas on vertical members cause excessive stress. The structure is closed but insufficiently stiff in the vertical direction, with node 4 at y=4.36 limiting triangulation. Moving node 4 down to 4.00 is shown in history to improve ratio but at cost of mass. The current setup shows member_2 and member_3 are under very small area, possibly acting as near-free hinges causing high stress in longer bottom chords (\'member_1\' and \'member_4\').",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "A good design will balance mass and strength by increasing area in key vertical members to reduce stress. Maintaining the node positions of supports and loaded node limits horizontal repositioning, but node_4 (free node) can be moved vertically for better triangulation. A fully triangulated structure distributing load evenly will reduce max stress. The prior \'rank_1\' structure had vertical members of larger area (4.0 and 3.0), reducing stress-to-weight ratio to 0.5758 but resulting in heavier mass (28.8). It is near the mass constraint, which is acceptable. Thus reusing node_4 near 4.0 and increasing vertical member areas is prudent. Areas must be chosen to reduce stress while keeping mass ≤ 30.",\n  "proposal": "Reuse the prior best structure \'rank_1\' with node_4 repositioned at (2.00, 4.00) for better triangulation, and member areas: bottom chords area_id \'2\' (0.782), vertical/horizontal diagonal members increased to area_id \'3\' and \'4\' (1.759, 3.128). This structure is closed, triangulated, satisfies constraints with a stress-to-weight ratio ~0.58 and total mass ~28.84, both within limits. No node repositioning on support/load nodes.",\n  "reasoning": "Triangulated closed truss minimizes bending and localizes axial load, reducing max stress. Larger cross-sectional areas on vertical and diagonal members reduce stress, while bottom chords hold compression/tension. Maintaining node_4 at y=4.00 fixes geometry, minimizes vertical span to reduce member length-related mass increase, while increasing vertical/diagonal stiffness. Using discrete areas from allowed range maintains consistent mass calculations. Fixed supports prevent rigid body movement, and load on node_3 is well supported by the triangulated layout.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: members are axial load elements. Member length calculation by Euclidean distance. Mass per member = length × area (area from string area_id). Stress proportional to load divided by area; increasing area reduces stress linearly. Max stress from member stress results, mass sum required ≤30. Use area IDs from given set: \'2\'=0.782, \'3\'=1.759, \'4\'=3.128. Node coordinates: node_1(0.00,0.00), node_2(6.00,0.00), node_3(2.00,0.00), node_4(2.00,4.00). Members: m1: 1-2, area \'2\'; m2:1-4 area \'4\'; m3:4-3 area \'3\'; m4:3-2 area \'2\'. Lengths: m1=6.0, m2=4.0, m3=4.0, m4=4.0. Mass sum approximates 6×0.782 + 4×3.128 + 4×1.759 + 4×0.782 = 4.692 + 12.512 + 7.036 + 3.128 = 27.37 approx, under 30. Max stress estimated reduces compared to prior under increased area. Stress-to-weight ratio likely ~0.58 as given.",\n  "calculation": "Member lengths: m1 (node_1-node_2): 6.0; m2 (node_1-node_4): sqrt((2-0)^2+(4-0)^2) = sqrt(4+16)=4.0; m3 (node_4-node_3): sqrt((2-2)^2+(0-4)^2)=4.0; m4 (node_3-node_2): 4.0. Areas: m1:\'2\'->0.782, m2:\'4\'->3.128, m3:\'3\'->1.759, m4:\'2\'->0.782. Mass=6×0.782 + 4×3.128 + 4×1.759 + 4×0.782 = 4.692 + 12.512 + 7.036 + 3.128 = 27.368. Max stress estimated under axially loaded members decreases with increased area, ratio now ~0.5758 < 0.75.
