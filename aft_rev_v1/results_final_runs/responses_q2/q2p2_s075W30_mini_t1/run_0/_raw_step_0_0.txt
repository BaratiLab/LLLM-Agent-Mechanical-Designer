Supports pinned at node_1 (0,0) and roller at node_2 (6,0) and node_3 (2,0). Objective: form a stable closed truss (triangle or polygon) connecting all nodes with minimal stress/weight ratio <=0.75 and mass <=30. 3 nodes alone are collinear and can\'t form a closed shape; need 1 or more new nodes not collinear for triangulation and closure. Areas must come from given discrete IDs. Stress includes axial load estimation on members; weight from sum(length*area).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load vector at node_3 is (-15, -30) representing a composed inclined load pointing back-left/down. Node_3 is roller support, so vertical force reaction possible but no moment. Node_1 pinned, restricts x,y translations; node_2 roller allows vertical movement only. The structure needs lateral stiffness to resist load (especially horizontal -15N at node_3). With three collinear nodes we have no closed polygon; adding a 4th node at some offset above/below line would allow triangulation. The load at node_3 must be transferred through members to supports at node_1 and node_2. To minimize stress-to-weight ratio, members must carry axial load efficiently (prefer direct load paths, short lengths, and suitable cross-sectional areas). Large areas are heavier but reduce stress. Area selection from given discrete sets requires balancing length and cross-section. Structure must be statically determinate or adequately redundant to distribute forces efficiently and remain stable.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Since node_3 is loaded and roller supported, a diagonal member connecting node_3 to node_1 or node_2 with a new node off the baseline can create a triangle for stability. The base line (node_1 to node_2) can remain horizontal. Introducing a midpoint above the baseline near node_3 can form two triangles sharing that node, giving good stiffness and efficient load transfer paths. This new node placement impacts member lengths and angles, hence stresses and weight. Avoid unnecessary members to keep weight low. The load direction suggests the diagonal member must efficiently resist compression/tension near node_3. Adding a single node above line near (2,2) or (3,3) and connect to node_1, node_3, and node_2 forms 3 new members and a closed truss with 4 nodes. Choose areas to balance stress and weight to meet constraints.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (3.0, 3.5) approximately above baseline near load for efficient triangulation. Members: base (node_1-node_2), two diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4), and two diagonals (node_3-node_4, node_3-node_1) to ensure connectivity and rigidity, but avoid redundancy beyond closed polygon. The closed polygon formed is nodes 1-2-4-3 with members: 1-2, 2-4, 4-3, 3-1. Area selection prioritizes smaller area (0.782 to 1.759) for lighter members on longer spans and bigger area on members with higher axial force. The longest member (node_1-node_2) can have smaller area (0.782) given no direct load. Diagonal members near node_3 (high load) get larger area (1.759). This arrangement is a minimal triangulated structure sufficient to carry the load with stress-to-weight ratio within limits.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic behavior, axial stress uniform in members, load transferred via axial forces only. Calculate member lengths from coordinates, axial forces from static equilibrium (sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, sum moments=0 at nodes). Estimate member stresses = axial force / area. Use area values from given IDs with corresponding thickness (assuming proportional density). Calculate mass = sum(length * area). Compute max absolute stress among members.
