Introduced one strategically placed node to improve triangulation and load distribution.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given three initially colinear nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0) with node_3 loaded at (-15, -30) units and supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 (roller). Constraints: max stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 0.75 and total mass ≤ 30. Need closed truss with all nodes connected.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Original nodes are colinear forming a line. This is structurally unstable for out-of-plane or vertical loads and not closed. To resist the downward-left load on node_3, introduction of a node above node_3 creates a stable triangular structure. Supports at nodes 1 and 2 provide horizontal and vertical constraints. Failure modes include buckling and excessive tensile/compressive stresses. Triangulation is key to resist load and maintain rigidity. Areas must balance material use and strength. The main load on node_3 pulls down and left, requiring tension in some members and compression in others.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "A node placed above node_3, approximately at (2.0, 3.0), creates two triangles: (node_1, node_3, new_node_4) and (node_3, node_2, new_node_4), forming a diamond shape. This improves stability and load transfer. Members from new_node_4 to node_1, node_2, and node_3 distribute forces efficiently. Choosing member areas from given discrete values helps optimize weight while maintaining strength.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Insert node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) directly above node_3 to form symmetrical triangular sections. Use members: (1-3), (3-2), (1-4), (4-2), (3-4) to form closed truss. Member (1-2) is not needed as it adds weight without triangulation benefit here. Assign large area_id for members under highest tensile stress (likely (3-4)), medium for compression members, and minimal required for others. The load transmission will flow node_3 → new_node_4 → nodes 1 & 2, with internal force equilibrium maintained. Stress-to-weight ratio calculated using bar lengths and assigned areas.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: uniform axial force distribution, steel-like material with linear elastic behavior, member stress proportional to axial force / area.
