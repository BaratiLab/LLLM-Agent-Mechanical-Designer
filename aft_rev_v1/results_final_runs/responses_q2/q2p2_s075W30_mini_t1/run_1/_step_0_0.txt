    "preamble": "Design a minimal stress-to-weight closed 2D truss connecting three original nodes under specified loads and supports. Objective: minimize max(abs(stress))/total_weight <= 0.75 with total mass <=30. Produce a triangulated, statically stable structure with efficient member sizing and possible additional node for optimal load transfer.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes at (0.0,0.0), (6.0,0.0), and (2.0,0.0) loaded at node_3 with force (-15, -30). Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 and node_3. Only three nodes aligned on x-axis initially, so structure is not stable unless triangulated or additional node added. Existing members possible: node_1-node_2, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3 all colinear, so no closed shape. Need new node to create a triangle for stability and load path.",
    
    "analysis": "Loads at node_3 pull down-left (quadrant III). Supports prevent horizontal and vertical displacement at node_1 and vertical displacement at node_2 and node_3 (rollers). With nodes colinear on x-axis, no planar stiffness; truss must be triangulated to resist bending/moments. Introducing a triangular node above the line near load node_3 will transfer vertical loads through diagonal members. The main failure modes: buckling under compression and tension failures. Efficiency depends on the shortest load path and mass distribution from members under tension and compression. Without diagonal bracing, high stress in long members. Optimal area selection weights longer members less and reinforces higher force members.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation is key for stability, introducing a node above original line around (2.5,2.0) creates stable triangular cells. Member sizing leans towards small area in compression members and larger areas in tension where necessary. Load at node_3 mostly vertical downwards; diagonal members from new node to node_3 and node_1 will take compression and tension. Balanced distribution avoids overstressing single members. Mass limit of 30 is ample if area sizes chosen carefully for mostly short members. Stress-to-weight ratio constrained to 0.75 is achievable with triangulated design and correct area sizing.",
    
    "reasoning": "Add new node_4 at (2.5, 2.0) above line to form two triangular cells: (node_1, node_4, node_3) and (node_2, node_4, node_3). Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_3, node_1-node_2. This closed polygon ensures full connectivity. Use small area (0.195) for short members under low stress, medium areas for members under moderate loads, largest areas where tension/compression demand is high. Areas chosen from given discrete sets. New node position chosen to minimize member length but maximize vertical height to reduce bending moment. This geometry efficiently transfers load to supports minimizing member forces and thus stress-to-weight ratio.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assuming linear axial force distribution, use equilibrium equations (ΣFx=0, ΣFy=0, ΣM=0). Calculate member lengths with Euclidean distance. Compute member forces by method of joints focusing on node_3 load: vertical and horizontal components balancing load. Select area by force magnitude to keep stress = force/(area*material_modulus) minimal. Total mass summing length*area densities. Constraints: max stress / total weight ≤ 0.75, and total mass ≤30. Adjust node_4 position and areas iteratively to meet constraints. Member indexing consistent: 6 members total forming 2 connected triangles.",
