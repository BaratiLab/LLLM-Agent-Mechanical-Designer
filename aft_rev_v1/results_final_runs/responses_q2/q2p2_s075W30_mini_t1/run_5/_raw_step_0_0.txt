Single support pinned at node_1 and roller support at node_2 and node_3. Constraints: max stress/weight ≤0.75 and total mass ≤30. Need triangulation for closure and efficient load transfer.",\n\n  "analysis": "Given only 3 nodes collinear on x-axis, the truss will be prone to bending under vertical load at node_3. The roller at node_3 provides vertical reaction but no moment restraint; pinned at node_1 restrains both. The load results in tensile and compressive forces along members. A triangular closed structure requires an additional node above x-axis to form stable triangles. Member stiffness and area selection crucial to balance stress and weight.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a new node elevated above the existing line near node_3 can create two triangles sharing the load. This will distribute the vertical load effectively through tension-compression members. Symmetry is not possible since node_2 is farther from node_3, but placing node_4 above the midpoint between node_2 and node_3 optimizes geometry. Members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_2 for closure. Use high area for members under compression or tension to reduce max stress.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (4.0, 3.0) forming triangles (1-3-4) and (2-3-4). Triangles improve load paths and create redundancy. Keep node_3 as roller to allow vertical reaction. Assign thin area to horizontal bottom chord (1-2) to reduce weight, bigger area to diagonal and vertical members for strength. Use area ids 7 (9.578), 5 (4.887), and 1 (0.195) judiciously. Prioritize larger areas on diagonals to reduce stress-to-weight ratio.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members carry axial load only. Calculate member lengths by Euclidean distance.
