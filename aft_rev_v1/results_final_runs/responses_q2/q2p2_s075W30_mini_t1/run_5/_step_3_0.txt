  "preamble": "The current truss with 5 nodes and 7 members does not satisfy the stress-to-weight ratio constraint (2.09 > 0.75). The goal is to produce a closed 2D truss connecting all nodes with lower stress-to-weight ratio and total mass under 30, preserving supports and load nodes coordinates.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load is applied on node_3 (-15.0, -30.0), supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2, and node_3 (rollers). The current structure has a max stress around 16.24 and total mass 7.77. History shows a better design (rank_1) with lower stress-to-weight ratio (0.532) but higher mass (13.89). We must reduce stress-to-weight below 0.75 with total mass <30.",
  "analysis": "The structure has nodes predominantly along x-axis with elevated nodes 4 and 5 providing triangulation. Load at node_3 downward-left results in high stress in member_1 (node_1-node_3). The current areas in members are mostly '1' except member_1 with '2' and member_7 with '2'. Rank_1 structure uses thicker members (area_id '3') on key load paths node_1-node_3 and node_2-node_4, reducing stress but increasing mass. The current structure lacks sufficient thickness or optimized node placements to reduce stress concentration.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress-to-weight ratio below 0.75, increasing member areas in critical load paths is necessary combined with repositioning nodes 4 and 5 slightly higher to improve triangulation and load transfer. The load node and supports must remain fixed. History suggests member areas '3' on main diagonals and '1' elsewhere balance stress and mass well. Modest node elevation increase for top chords can improve stability and reduce bending.",
  "proposal": "Reuse the best historic nodes layout with slight node_4 and node_5 elevation increase as in rank_1 (node_4: [4.00, 3.50], node_5: [5.00, 1.75]) and assign member_1 and member_7 area '3' to increase stiffness, other members area '1' to control mass. This creates a well-triangulated closed truss. Confirm mass under 30 and calculate stress-to-weight ratio to verify feasibility.",
  "reasoning": "The design uses pinned node_1 and rollers at node_2 and node_3, so the load path goes through node_3 to node_1 and node_4, then to node_2 and node_5. Elevation of nodes 4 and 5 improves triangle height, increasing axial load efficiency and reducing bending. Using higher area ('3'=1.759) in main load carrying members reduces stress. The other members are kept slender (area '1' = 0.195) to reduce weight. This balanced design reduces max stress and maintains mass acceptable. This design is closed and fully connected.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Member forces primarily axial, stress proportional to force/area. Mass proportional to member length × area. Member lengths computed using Euclidean distance. Assign '3' to members carrying direct load (member_1: node_1-node_3, member_7: node_2-node_4). Others use '1'. Calculate weights = sum(length_i × area_i). Check max stress approx. 7-8 from history with these areas yields max stress-to-weight ratio ∼0.5, satisfying constraint < 0.75. Mass ~13.9 << 30. Node_1 (0.0, 0.0), node_2 (6.0, 0.0), node_3 (2.0, 0.0) fixed due to load/support. Nodes_4 and_5 repositioned slightly higher.",
  "calculation": "Calculate member lengths: m1(1-3)=2.0, m2(3-4)=sqrt((4-2)^2+(3.5-0)^2)=sqrt(4+12.25)=4.272, m3(4-5)=sqrt((5-4)^2+(1.75-3.5)^2)=sqrt(1+3.06)=2.032, m4(5-2)=sqrt((6-5)^2+(0-1.75)^2)=sqrt(1+3.06)=2.032, m5(5-1)=sqrt((5-0)^2+(1.75-0)^2)=5.297, m6(3-5)=sqrt((5-2)^2+(1.75-0)^2)=3.375, m7(2-4)=sqrt((6-4)^2+(0-3.5)^2)=sqrt(4+12.25)=4.272. Member masses= length×area: m1=2×1.759=3.518, m7=4.272×1.759=7.510, others length×0.195 (approx.): m2=4.272×0.195=0.833, m3=2.032×0.195=0.396, m4=2.032×0.195=0.396, m5=5.297×0.195=1.033, m6=3.375×0.195=0.658. Sum mass=3.518+7.510+0.833+0.396+0.396+1.033+0.658=14.344 < 30. Max stress approx 7.39 (from rank_1). Stress-to-weight=7.39/14.344=0.515 <0.75 constraint met.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Design meets all constraints: max stress-to-weight around 0.515 <0.75, total mass 14.344 <30. Nodes 1,2,3 fixed as required. Closed truss with 7 members fully connected and well triangulated. Areas assigned balancing load capacity vs weight. Node repositioning improves load path. Proceed to output final design.",
