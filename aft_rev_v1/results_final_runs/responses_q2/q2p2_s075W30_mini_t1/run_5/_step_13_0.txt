    "preamble": "Current truss is stable and satisfies constraints with stress-to-weight ratio 0.5743. Objective is to minimize this ratio further while maintaining closed structure and constraints.",

    "scratch_pad_1": "Current design has three nodes fixed or roller supported on x-axis. Load at node_3 is downward-left. Current max stress = 7.39, mass = 12.8689, ratio = 0.5743. Historical best solution has lower ratio 0.2182 but with larger mass ~19. Optimize for lower ratio with mass <= 30 and stress-to-weight <= 0.75.",

    "analysis": "Current structure keeps nodes mostly aligned horizontally for supports and load at node_3. The members connected to node_4 and node_5 form upper chords, but members 3 and 4 have zero area, reducing stiffness in upper triangle. Larger members in history (rank_1) improve stress distribution but increase mass. The load at node_3 (-15, -30) is significant vertical and horizontal shear combined; members at node_3 must resist axial loads efficiently. Current design's highest stress (member_1) is -7.385 with cross-sectional area '3' (1.759) but mass is moderate. Members with zero area waste nodes and member potential. Connection from node_4 to node_2 (member_7) uses area '1' which is small. Load path shows need for triangulation connecting node_3, node_4, node_5, and node_2. Symmetry around node_3 to node_5 to node_4 should be refined to distribute load stresses lower.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Larger cross sections reduce stress but increase weight. Historical best uses area '4' (3.128) in critical member_1 (node_1 to node_3) to reduce peak stress. Trade-off is increased weight but far better stress-to-weight ratio. Zero area members reduce stiffness and should have minimum area. The current design uses zero area for member_3 and member_4, which should be nonzero to improve upper chord force path. Node_5 vertical position increased slightly improves triangulation. Node_4 and node_5 positions can be optimized slightly upward to improve force angles. Load is significant at node_3 so member_1 should be large area. Roller support at node_3 restricts only vertical but allows horizontal displacement, so member_1 should handle horizontal load accordingly.",

    "proposal": "Adopt the node placements and member assignments similar to rank_1 as it yielded the best stress-to-weight ratio 0.2182, though mass increased. Move node_4 to (4.40, 3.50) and node_5 to (5.00, 2.00). Assign cross-sectional areas according to rank_1: member_1 area '4' (3.128) to reduce max stress, members 2 and 3 area '0' (1.0) for upper chords, member_4 area '0' (1.0), member_5 area '1' (0.195), member_6 area '2' (0.782), member_7 area '1' (0.195). This closed, fully connected truss satisfies constraints and minimizes stress-to-weight ratio.",

    "reasoning": "Using structural principles: triangulation at nodes 3,4,5,2 distributes load. Increasing critical member areas reduces stress peak. Keeping member areas low where forces are minor reduces weight. Node_4 raised to 3.5 and node_5 to 2.0 improves force transfer angles, reducing bending moments. Member_1 between node_1 and node_3 carries largest load, hence largest area. Members 2,3,4 act as upper chord distributing tension/compression with moderate areas. Lowering mass on members 5,6,7 by reducing area leverages lower forces there while maintaining structural integrity. This complies with constraints and improves overall ratio.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Stress is axial, members are pin-connected. Mass calculated by sum(length * area) with area from {'0':1.0, '1':0.195, '2':0.782, '3':1.759, '4':3.128}. Max(abs(stress))/mass must be <=0.75. Lengths found by Euclidean distance between nodes. Member stresses scale inversely with cross-sectional area if shape and load path consistent. Set member_1 area to '4' to reduce stress proportionally. Calculate new masses, check stress-to-weight ratio. Node positions fixed on loads/supports, others optimized for geometry and minimal lengths. Validate all nodes connected and structure closed.",

    "calculation": "Calculate lengths: node_1 (0,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (4.4,3.5), node_5 (5.0,2.0), node_2 (6.0,0.0). Length m1: 2.0, m2: 3.2016, m3: 1.5, m4: 2.236, m5: ~5.39, m6: 3.6055, m7: 2.0616. Calculate mass: sum(length * area) = member_1: 2*3.128=6.256, member_2:3.2016*1=3.2016, member_3:1.5*1=1.5, member_4:2.236*1=2.236, member_5:5.39*0.195=1.050, member_6:3.6055*0.782=2.8195, member_7:2.0616*0.195=0.402. Total mass ~17.46 < 30. Max stress proportionally reduced due to larger area on member_1, estimated max stress ~4.14 (from history rank_1), stress-to-weight ratio ~4.14/17.46=0.237 < 0.75 constraint. Structure is closed and connected.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "Node placement and member areas from historic rank_1 structure yields best known stress-to-weight ratio with compliant constraints. Load paths reasonable. Supports and loads fixed as required. No isolated nodes. Total mass within limit, maximum stress reduced by increased member_1 area. No further optimization expected without drastic redesign. Will return this design and stop.",
