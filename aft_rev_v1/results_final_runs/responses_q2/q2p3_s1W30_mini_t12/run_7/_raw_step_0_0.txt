Objective is to add minimal new nodes and members to complete a closed truss and ensure static equilibrium with constraints on stress-to-weight ratio <=1.0 and mass <=30.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes provided are colinear on x-axis: node_1(0,0), node_3(2,0), node_2(6,0). Load (-15, -30) applied at node_3, which is roller supported. node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Direct horizontal members exist. Structure is open; needs closure to handle load safely and maintain equilibrium.",\n\n    "analysis": "Since nodes are colinear, the current line beam will deflect and has no triangulation for stability, load transfer in vertical direction is poor. Load at node_3 has vertical and horizontal components, causing bending if only straight members. Supports fix vertical & horizontal reactions only at node_1 and vertical at node_2, roller at node_3 can move vertically/horizontally freely. To resist vertical load, we need a triangular or polygon closed truss introducing vertical and inclined members that absorb load in axial tension/compression. Beam length and mass must stay within constraint (<=30) considering area choices from given list. Stress-to-weight ratio requires balance of member areas and load distribution.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Introducing a single internal node above the line to form a triangle and introduce diagonals will close the truss and shift bending forces into axial forces. Node positioned near load with some x-offset will improve force distribution. Using reasonably smaller areas for less stressed members and larger for main load members to balance mass and stresses. Avoiding adding more nodes to keep complexity and mass minimal. Selectively sizing area to keep stress below limit and mass adequate.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Add one node above the line between node_1 and node_2 near node_3 at (3.0, 3.0). Creates two triangles (node_1,node_4,node_3) and (node_3,node_4,node_2) closing the structure. Members: bottom chord (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), top chord (node_1-node_4), (node_4-node_2), and diagonals (node_3-node_4) closing upper plate and transmitting load. Area choice: biggest area for members carrying largest forces (bottom chords and diagonal), medium area for top chord members. This triangulation converts bending moment at loaded node to axial forces evenly distributed.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths by coordinate distance. Estimate force in members by simple statics: vertical force -15N and horizontal -30N at node_3 balanced by nearby diagonals and bottom chords. Member forces roughly: high tension in diagonal node_3-node_4 absorbing vertical load; bottom chords mainly in compression tension; top chord carries tension. Stress = force/area, mass = sum(length*area).
