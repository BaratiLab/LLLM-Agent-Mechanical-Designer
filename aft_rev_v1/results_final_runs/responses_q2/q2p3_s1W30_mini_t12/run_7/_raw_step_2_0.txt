Current design valid at iteration 1/25 with stress-to-weight of 0.3074 and total mass ~23kg. Objective: reduce ratio under constraints: max stress-to-weight ≤ 1.0, total mass ≤ 30, keep nodes with loads/support unchanged, and maintain closed structure.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes with pinned (node_1) and roller supports (node_2, node_3), and a diagonal load at node_3 (-15 N, -30 N axis). Members mostly with area_id=2 or 3. Structure is a quadrilateral with one interior diagonal member. Current mass 23 and max stress ~7.07 (units assumed consistent). History shows an attempt with larger area member_5 failed constraints due to mass overflow. Need lighter or better force distribution.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current truss forms a triangle with an external base between nodes_1 and _2 and a vertical with nodes_4 slightly off-center above base line tapping load node_3 and supports. Load path activates mainly horizontal lower chords (member_1,2) and diagonal members (member_3,4,5). With member_5 area_id=3 (1.759) and sizeable length (~3.15), it carries moderate stress but small stress-to-weight ratio due to cross-sectional area weight relationship. The base members (1,2) have higher masses but carry most of axial compression/tension close to limits. Net mass acceptable but little room to reduce areas without risk. Constraint that mass ≤30 is met. Member 2 has low stress suggesting possibility to reduce area there. The rejected structure with node_4 at (3.0,3.0) had heavier  area_5 (4.887) member which caused mass >30. The current position of node_4 slightly left at (2.55,3.15) reduces length of members 4 and 5, reduces mass but leaves room to optimize node_4 along vertical to reduce stress imbalance.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_2 carries low stress (0.21) versus member_1 large compressive near -7 stress. Suggests load is unevenly shared between the nodes 1-3 and 3-2 paths. Node_4 positioning affects load distribution; small left shift increases effect of member_4 and reduces member_5 axial load. Member areas can be optimized downward starting from member_2 and possibly member_4. Also, node_4 can be lifted slightly upward from 3.15 to improve geometry, to improve triangulation and reduce stress concentration by balancing member angles and lengths.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Adjust node_4 position slightly upward and left within allowable range (keep node_4 within horizontal bounds of node_1 to node_2), and reduce cross-sectional area of low-stress members (member_2 from \'3\' to \'2\', member_4 from \'2\' to \'1\') to reduce mass. Keep load nodes and support nodes fixed. This should generate a better force balance and reduce overall stress-to-weight ratio without violating mass limit.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Improved load balancing by increasing node_4 vertical height improves triangulation to transfer forces more evenly. Reducing area of low-stress members reduces mass, impacting denominator positively. Members under low stress can be downscaled with minor EF and safety risk. Member_1 remains as area 3 due to high compressive load. Member_5 remains area 3 for stability and load carry. Use design principle of stiffness increase by triangulation and prudent area assignment based on experienced member force pattern.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Member length measured by distance node_i - node_j. Axial stress proportionate to axial force / area. Mass computed as length × area_factor (from area_id dictionary). Start node_4 at (2.4, 3.25).
