Load acts downward-left (-15, -30) on node_3. Supports: node_1 pinned (both x/y fixed), node_2 roller (vertical restrain), node_3 roller (vertical restrain). Only three nodes arranged on x-axis, need closed truss means adding nodes and members. Constraints: stress-to-weight ratio <=1, total mass <=30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Initial structure is colinear, no vertical triangulation or stiffness. Under load at node_3, truss will fail to carry lateral force effectively. Need to create vertical or inclined members forming triangles. Best to add at least one top node above horizontal line at node_3 to form triangle. The supporting nodes do not carry horizontal (except pinned node_1) so left supports must help resist horizontal force. Also, members must be efficiently sized (area selection) to reduce mass. Combining vertical bracing with diagonal is typical. Failure modes include axial tension/compression exceeding stress limits or excessive weight from oversized members.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Insights: structure benefit from adding a top node located near node_3 horizontally but elevated vertically for triangulated member configuration. Triangles provide stability. Using members: node_1 to new top node, top node to node_2, top node to node_3, plus base members node_1-node_2, node_2-node_3 and node_3-node_1. This 4-node, 7-member configuration forms multiple triangular closed loops, optimally carrying the eccentric load and avoiding mechanism. Keep top node at x ~2.5m above base to keep member length minimal yet enough vertical height to control lateral load.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Add new node \'node_4\' at (2.5, 3.0). Triangulate by adding members: node_1-node_3, node_1-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_2. Use smaller area ids for longer members expected in tension and larger distinct ids in compression locations. Minimize mass by assigning smaller cross-section for lower force members and modest or moderate cross-section for members bearing major loads. Calculate member forces using static equilibrium and trigonometry. Select areas to keep stress-to-weight <=1, and total mass below 30.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: uniform material density ignored as only relative lengths and area product (mass) used. Gravity load (node_3 partially downward). Load vector at node_3 = (-15i, -30j). Use 2D equilibrium equations ∑Fx=0 and ∑Fy=0, and moment balance about node_1. Member length calculation by Euclidean distance; mass=sum(length*area_id). Area value lookup: 0:\'1\', 1:\'0.195\', etc. Assign plausible font size id for low area members 1 or 2, major members 5 or 6. Solve equilibrium to get member forces -> stress=max(abs(force/cross-sectional area)).

Calculate mass = sum(length*area). Mass ~= (6*1.759)+(4*1.759)+(2*0.195)+(3.91*4.887)+(3.04*3.128)+(4.60*1.759)~10.55+7.04+0.39+19.12+9.50+8.09=approx 54.7 (exceeds mass limit). Need to reduce large areas or remove member 3-1 since node_1-node_2 and node_2-node_3 is supported by node_4 members. Removing n3-n1 (smallest length 2m *0.195=0.39, worth checking). Recalculate mass without n3-n1: ~ 54.7-0.39=54.3 still too large. Try reducing area on large members to area_id \'2\' = 0.782 to reduce mass: for node_1-node_4, n4-n3, n2-n4. New masses: (3.91*0.782)+(3.04*0.782)+(4.60*0.782)=3.06+2.38+3.59=8.99 + remaining (6*1.759)+(4*1.759)+(2*0.195) = 10.55+7.04+0.39=17.98 total 26.97 (<30) good allocation.
