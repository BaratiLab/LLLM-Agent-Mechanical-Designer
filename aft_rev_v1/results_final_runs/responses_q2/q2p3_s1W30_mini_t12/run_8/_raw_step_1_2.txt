The goal is to produce a fully triangulated and statically stable truss, minimizing stress-to-weight ratio below 1.0 and keeping total mass under 30, without moving load-bearing or supported nodes.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Initial structure is a shallow triangular truss with an interior node (node_4) elevated at y=3.5; members have uneven area assignments resulting in stress concentration on diagonal member_4 (from node_1 to node_3). Load applied at node_3 downward and leftward. Supports at base nodes. Constraints require stress-to-weight <=1 and mass <=30. Current max stress -35.12 too high compared to member capacities.",\n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 causes large forces in direct horizontal member_4 (node_1-node_3) and connecting diagonals. The current member areas (member_4 area=1 which is small) contribute to high stress on member_4. Members connecting elevated node_4 to node_1, node_2, node_3 form instability with high stress. The structure is not fully triangulatedâ€”currently four nodes connected with 6 members, but load path is poor. Roller support at node_3 zero vertical reaction limits vertical load transfer. Improving triangulation, especially adding diagonal members to transfer load through elevated node_4 will reduce max stress. Increasing cross-section for heavily loaded members, and repositioning node_4 higher will increase lever arm and reduce forces. Symmetry between nodal layout and supports ensures force balance.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Pattern shows concentrated load paths on node_1 to node_3 member, with insufficient support from elevated truss nodes. Constraints maintain node_1, node_2, node_3 positions, so design improvement lies in adjustments to node_4 position, and adding additional members for better triangulation and load sharing. Using larger area cross-sections on key diagonals and base members will lower stress. Avoid oversizing to maintain mass below 30.",\n  "proposal": "Retain node_1, node_2, node_3 locations. Raise node_4 slightly to increase truss height to better distribute loads. Add an additional diagonal member from node_2 to node_3 with larger cross-section for better load path. Increase member areas of highly stressed members, especially node_1-node_3 and diagonals from node_4. Use area_id \'3\' (1.759) or \'4\' (3.128) for main diagonals, and smaller areas on direct base members. This should reduce max stress-to-weight ratio under 1.0 and keep total mass < 30. This approach follows closed triangular truss concepts.",\n  "reasoning": "Elevation of node_4 from 3.5 to approx. 4.0 expands vertical lever arms, which decreases axial forces in diagonal tension/compression members. Adding diagonal member_5 from node_2 to node_3 (not yet in largest area) with area_id \'3\' provides additional load path. Increasing area of member_4 (node_1-node_3) from \'1\' to \'3\' reduces its stress dramatically. Base chord members remain at smaller area to limit mass. This creates a fully triangulated, closed truss that balances the load and lessens peak stresses.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths of members with raised node_4 at (4.00, 4.00). Member lengths between node pairs determined by Euclidean distance. Use area lookup for member mass: mass = length * area. Estimate member forces by method of joints assuming static equilibrium. Check max(abs(force)/area) / total_mass to ensure stress-to-weight ratio <=1. Total mass sum(length_i * area_i) <=30 notes constraint.
