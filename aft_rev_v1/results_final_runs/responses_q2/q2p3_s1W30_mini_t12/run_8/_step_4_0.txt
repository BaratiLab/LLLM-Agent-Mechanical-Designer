  "preamble": "Optimize a 4-node closed truss under given loads and supports by minimizing stress-to-weight ratio while satisfying constraints on stress ratio and total mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given structure has nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), (4,3.5) connected with 6 members. Load applied at node_3 (2,0) is (-15,-30). Supports constrain node_1 pinned and node_2, node_3 rollers. Current max stress-to-weight ratio is 0.6801 < 1.0, total mass 10.42 < 30, constraints met. There is history of ranked structures with better ratios but at higher mass.",
  "analysis": "Current structure has load applied at node_3 near midpoint along base and node_4 elevated at y=3.5. Members between bases and apex node_4 form triangle with node_1, node_2, plus cross members inside. max absolute stress occurs in member_4 (node_1–node_3) very high tension or compression (-7.0863). Current mass is relatively low; stress-to-weight ratio close to 0.68. History indicates increasing member cross-section area reduces ratio significantly (to ~0.185) but increases mass (~21.58). With the loading primarily going through node_3 as load and roller, supports at node_1 and node_2 restrain horizontal and vertical displacements. Load paths suggest critical forces run through member connecting node_1 and node_3, indicating redesign or increasing area on that member reduces max stress. Node_4 height affects triangulation and load distribution. Increasing its height in past optimal designs improved stress ratio but at cost higher mass. Current lower mass provided higher stress ratio. Members with area_4 or larger reduce stress by increasing cross section but increase mass.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Observing history, increasing area in critical members and enhancing height of node_4 elevated stress distribution improvement drastically but mass roughly doubled. Current low mass structure bears higher stress on few members indicating underutilized heavier members for better efficiency. Modifying node_4's vertical position slightly upward could improve force resolution reducing member_4 stress. Trade-off between cross section and node_4 height should aim to minimize product. Modest cross section increments (area_2, area_3) on key members with node_4 reposition is promising. Geometry symmetric left/right, fixing load and supports nodes means fine-tuning node_4 only.",
  "proposal": "Adopt prior successful approach: reposition node_4 slightly higher from 3.50 to ~3.80 for better triangulation, increase area for critical members (member_1, member_2, member_3) to area '2' (0.782), member_4 (node_1-node_3) increased to area '4' (3.128), maintain smaller area in base member_6 for overall mass control. Cross sections increase mass but reduce max stress substantially reducing the stress-to-weight ratio below previous best 0.1853 safely within constraints.",
  "reasoning": "Triangular geometry with apex node_4 elevated improves load distribution, symmetry minimizes eccentric moments. Using second-level cross-sections (area '2') in primary vertical-loader resisting members ensure inelastic limits not exceeded. Heavier area for member_4 (critically stressed) reduces max member force per area thus stress. Base member cross-section kept minimal to avoid mass penalty. The load path from node_3 to supports via node_4 allows vertical load redirected efficiently by longer triangle sides. Chosen area values fit constraints and past history success.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Member length from Euclidean distance; weight approximated by sum(length * area_scalar). Member stress reduces inversely proportionally with area increase assuming load constant. Stability guaranteed by closed truss connectivity. Need to balance mass (total < 30) and max(abs(stress))/total_mass < 1.0 constraint. Using node_4 move up from 3.5 to 3.8 meters to tighten triangulation angle and reduce bending stresses on base member crossing. Calculate member lengths, total mass, estimate max stress reduction from history scaling, member selection per area keys.",
  "calculation": "Node positions: node_4 at (4.00, 3.80). Member lengths and areas set: member_1, member_2, member_3 area '2' = 0.782; member_4 area '4' = 3.128; member_5 area '2' = 0.782; member_6 area '1' = 0.195 (minimal). Sum mass ≈ 4.3145 + 3.3581 + 3.3581 + 6.256 + 3.128 + 1.17 = ~21.58 below max 30. From history rank_1, max stress-to-weight ratio is 0.1853 well below 1.0. No violated constraints. Stress distribution is balanced with reduced max stress around 4.0 units. Design repeated from best rank_1 from history confirming validated solution.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Output final dictionary structure with specified node coordinates, member connections, and updated cross sectional areas. Nodes keep fixed loads/support nodes unchanged; only node_4 repositioned. Selected member areas from optimal historic result ensure minimized stress-to-weight ratio and constraint adherence.",
  "stop": "True # Optimal solution confirmed as rank_1 historical structure with minimized stress-to-weight ratio within constraints.",
