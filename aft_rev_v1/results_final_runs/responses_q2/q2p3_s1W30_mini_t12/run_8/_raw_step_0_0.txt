Constraints include total mass ≤ 30 and max stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 1.0. Current nodes are colinear, so closed form demands inserting additional nodes to introduce triangulation.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Load on node_3 is left-downward (-15.0, -30.0). Supports fix node_1 (pinned) and roller restrains vertical motion at node_2 and node_3. Original nodes colinear, causing bending and ineffective load path. Without additional bracing, stress concentration will be high in horizontal members, risking exceeding limits or requiring very large areas (mass). Efficient load path transfers forces from node_3 to supports mainly through triangulated members to avoid bending.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Realized better load path could be created by raising an apex node above current line to form a triangle. This would allow distributing load between node_1 and node_2 via node_4 above nodes line. This is better than colinear arrangement. Also promotes full connectivity and closed structure.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at approximately x=4.0, y=3.5 (above line near node_3) to create two triangles: (node_1, node_4, node_3) and (node_4, node_2, node_3). This configuration transfers the load efficiently, uses tension/compression in diagonal members, minimizes bending. For mass, choose moderate cross-sections: diagonals larger area (to resist axial loads), horizontal baseline members smaller area (mainly compression/ minimal load), keeping total mass under 30, while keeping stresses low.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members act axially, linear-elastic behavior, self-weight ignored, stress proportional to member force / area, areas taken from given area IDs as multiples of 1. Areas=[0=1,1=0.195,2=0.782,3=1.759...]. Geometry lengths calculated via Euclidean distances. Force balance: vertical and horizontal equilibrium.
