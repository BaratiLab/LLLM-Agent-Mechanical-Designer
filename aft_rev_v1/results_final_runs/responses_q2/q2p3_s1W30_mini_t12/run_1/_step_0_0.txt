    "preamble": "Optimize a closed 2D truss for nodes at (0,0), (6,0), and (2,0) under a single downward-left load at node_3. Minimize max(abs(stress))/total_weight while respecting stress-to-weight ≤ 1.0 and total mass ≤ 30 using predefined areas. Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 (roller).",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Three colinear nodes with node_3 loaded down-left. Initial structure is a single beam between node_1 and node_2 with node_3 as midpoint; this is not closed nor stable. Need triangulation for closure and to stiffen against load direction. Load tries to cause bending and horizontal shift; roller supports restrict vertical at node_2, pinned fixes node_1 both directions, node_3 roller allows vertical movement. Aim to add nodes and members forming a stable truss minimizing bending and stress relative to weight.",

    "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-15N horizontal-left, -30N vertical-down) induces tension on members resisting left-ward pull and compression on vertical elements. With node_3 on the baseline, no moment arm for triangulation exists rigidly; vertical height required for efficient triangulation to resist load (from shear and axial force balance). The pinned at node_1 fully constrains the structure while node_2 and node_3 are rollers, making vertical reactions only at node_1. Adding a new node above node_3 creates triangle(s) stabilizing against vertical and horizontal load. Member choice (area_id) affects weight and stress capacity—tradeoff to optimize the ratio. Avoid heavy sections on shorter members; strategically place larger cross-sections on high force members (diagonals).",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulating node_3 with a new node above creates a stable 3D (2D plane) closed truss of 4 nodes and minimum 5 members: (node_1-node_4), (node_4-node_3), (node_3-node_2), (node_1-node_3), (node_2-node_4). Symmetry not required but coordinates of new node_4 optimally placed at x ≈ 3.0, y ≈ 3.0 to optimize axial forces. Areas chosen by relative force carried in members, longer members kept lighter, diagonals heavier. Assumption: linear elastic truss members, axial only forces.",

    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (3.0, 3.0) to form two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_4, node_3, node_2) closing the structure and providing load path. This stiffness avoids bending filaments and distributes tensile/compressive forces between vertical and diagonal members. Select member ids from areas: use larger areas for diagonals and vertical member to limit stress; edges along baseline smaller. This reduces max stress, total weight stays under 30. Confirm all nodes connected with no duplications. Approximate member lengths via distance formula to calculate mass. Estimate internal forces with(resolve equilibrium in horizontal and vertical directions plus moment equilibrium about node_1).",
