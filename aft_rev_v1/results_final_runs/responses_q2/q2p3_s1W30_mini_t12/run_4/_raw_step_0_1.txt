The objective is to ensure load path clarity, complete enclosure, and load transfer within constraints on mass and stress/weight ratio.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes at (0,0), (6,0), and (2,0) are colinear along the x-axis; a closed truss requires at least a triangle. The load (-15N, -30°) acts on node_3 (at 2,0) down and left with components (-12.99N, -7.5N approx). Supports: node_1 pinned (fixed in both), node_2 roller (vertical only), node_3 roller (vertical only). The current set is not closed and cannot carry out a stable truss load transfer with these only three colinear points. Additional node(s) needed to form a triangle and close the truss for load path stability.",\n    \n    "analysis": "To form a closed truss with given colinear nodes, introduce one node above the line between node_1 and node_2 (or near). This creates a triangle for rigid structure, ensuring triangulated load paths. The load at node_3 requires horizontal and vertical support. Node_1 pinned bears horizontal reactions, node_2 roller allows vertical reactions. Node_3 roller restricts lateral reactions, so the triangle must sufficiently transfer load components primarily through members between node_3-node_1, node_3-new_node, and new_node-node_1 or new_node-node_2. Euler method applied to member lengths, forces, and stress estimation for sizing cross-sections to minimize max stress/weight ratio while maintaining mass <=30 with selected area IDs.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The key is to place one node above x-axis in usable position which forms a near-equilateral triangle providing stiffness and direct load paths. Avoid large or midsized members to reduce mass. Use high efficiency moderately stiff/reduced area members where possible to meet constraint on max stress/weight ratio <=1.0 and mass <=30. Use smallest areas on longer members if tension/compression is low, increased area only on high stress members near load/support. Target simple 4-member triangular truss closed frame: node_1-node_2, node_1-new_node, new_node-node_3, and node_3-node_2, plus diagonal node_1-node_3 if beneficial.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Adding node_4 at (2.8, 2.7) forms a triangle with node_1 and node_2 and includes stable load path for load at node_3. Four members: (node_1-node_4), (node_4-node_2), (node_4-node_3), and (node_3-node_2) cover structure. Node_3 connects both horizontally and diagonally to distribute forces. Assign areas from small to medium depending on force magnitude and length. Smaller area ID 1 (0.195) for longer members under less stress, medium for near the loaded node due to higher stress. Use pinned node_1 to anchor structure and rollers at node_2 and node_3 for vertical reactions minimizing moment generation. The design ensures triangulated, stable, and closed minimal mass truss supporting load and meeting stress constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Structural members behave elastically, axial forces dominate. Areas selected from provided set matching stress and weight objectives. Length of members calculated using Euclidean distance. Forces resolved by static equilibrium at joints. Stress computed as axial force divided by cross-sectional area scaled by area ID value. Total mass proportional = sum of (length × area_value) <= 30.
