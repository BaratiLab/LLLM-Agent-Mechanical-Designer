The current max ratio is 5.1931 with total mass well below max mass. Objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss with improved load carrying and stress distribution to reduce max stress-to-weight ratio below 1.0 while keeping total mass ≤30.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given forces -15,-30 at node_3, supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 and node_3 (rollers), structure is currently a triangle with node_4 above a base of three nodes. Current mass 9.59 and max stress 49.8, ratio too high. Constraints not met.",\n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 downward-left leads to high stress on members connected to node_4 and node_3. Node_3 itself on x-axis too close to node_1 and node_2, limiting load distribution. Current members lack a fully triangulated pattern; member_3 connecting node_4 and node_3 also has large stress. The member area choices appear suboptimal for stress control. Only 4 members create insufficient redundancy and poor stress distribution. Generation history shows no better structure.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress mostly concentrated on member_2 (-49.8) and member_4 (38.1) indicating bending effects and overloaded axial members. The sparsity and linearity on base nodes restrict load path optimization. Need to add members for triangulation, reposition node_4 higher to improve geometry, and add a member between node_1 and node_2 to close the truss base. Possibly add an extra node above with connections for improved stiffness and stress sharing. Area choices need to consider increasing for heavily stressed members while controlling mass by keeping others minimal.",\n  "proposal": "We propose to redesign the truss with 5 nodes: keep the supports and loads fixed on nodes 1, 2, and 3; reposition node_4 higher on y-axis to reduce member length stress and add node_5 above node_4 forming a trapezoid shape. Connect all nodes forming fully triangulated members for efficient load transfer, including base member between node_1 and node_2 and top member between node_4 and node_5. Use increased cross-sectional areas (area_id \'4\' or \'5\') for members under tension/compression and minimal areas (\'1\' or \'2\') for less stressed members to keep mass low but improve stress distribution.",\n  "reasoning": "Providing a fifth node located approximately centered between nodes 3 and 4 and higher up improves vertical and horizontal stiffness and allows load redistribution. Symmetry and triangulated connectivity reduce bending moments, lowering peak stresses and thus improving the stress-to-weight ratio. A fully closed quadrilateral with internal triangulation is more effective than a sparse non-closed triangle and segments. Supports remain unchanged for stability. Increasing key member areas keeps stresses under allowable limit but restricted mass ensures total remains under 30. Calculations based on member lengths and forces estimated from directions and node distances.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate length of members using Euclidean distance. Member mass = length × area coefficient (area_id values). Estimate max stress from load and member force approx using force equilibrium on nodes. Approximate the max stress-to-weight ratio by dividing max abs stress by total mass. Optimize node_4 vertical position around 3.5-4.0 m to reduce member length and stress. Node_5 location horizontally midway between node_3 and node_4 and vertically higher. Define members as edges ensuring all nodes connected and closed loops. Check mass below 30 and max stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 1 before confirmation.",\n  "calculation": "Node coordinates chosen with node_4 at (2.8, 3.7) and node_5 at (4.0, 5.0).

Assign areas with large cross section for bottom chords and diagonals from loaded node to top (areas \'4\' or \'5\'), small area (\'1\', \'2\') elsewhere.
