    "preamble" :  "Optimize the current 2D truss structure under vertical/horizontal load at node_3 with supports on nodes 1,2,3. Objective is to minimize the max stress-to-weight ratio while ensuring mass ≤30 and stress/weight ≤1.",

    "scratch_pad_1": "Current structure has max stress-to-weight ratio at 0.6482 < 1 (good) and mass 10.94 < 30 (good). The best history score achieved 0.4311 but with heavier mass ~16.45. Trade-offs between member areas and locations need exploiting.",

    "analysis": "The current structure is connected and closed, stable with pinned and roller supports. Members with large cross-sections are near support node_1 and over node_4 connections. The highest compressive stress is in member_1, a primary load path from node_3 to node_1. Favoring slightly bigger cross-sections at tense locations (like members from node_3 to node_4), helped by symmetric load paths, lowers stress concentration. Lighter members are used on secondary load paths (like from node_5 to node_2). The ranked history shows larger areas (area_id '3') in members connecting node_3-node_4 and node_4-node_5 lowered stress ratios but increased mass substantially. The current design uses area '2' on longest diagonals for an intermediate weight/stiffness balance. Node_5 slightly repositioned can help share forces better and allow switching a member area to reduce mass without increasing stress unacceptably.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Load distribution depends on triangulated shape maintained by nodes 1,3,4,5,2 with node_5 crucial in force redistribution to roller at node_2. Minor node_5 horizontal shift within [4.0,4.1] keeps or improves historic best balance. Area_ids '1'(0.195), '2'(0.782), and '3'(1.759) can be optimized for mass/stress trade. Avoid over-sizing to not exceed total mass. Rewrite member areas near high stress members to reduce ratio. Small node moves at node_4 disallowed (load/support fixed points), node_5 movement offers room to optimize.",

    "proposal": "Adopt the historically best-loaded arrangement with nodes same as rank_1/d2 move = 4.10, maintain all load/support node locations as fixed. Upgrade members between node_3-node_4 and node_4-node_5 to area_id '3' for better stress distribution. Other members mostly area '1' or '3' keeping weight balanced. Fine-tune node_5 position to (4.10, 0.00) to improve force paths without increasing stress above 7.09. This leads to max stress-to-weight ~0.431 meeting constraints.",

    "reasoning": "The structure is symmetrically loaded and triangulated for stability. Increasing cross-sectional area where stress concentrates reduces the maximum stress. Nodes with loads and supports fixed for boundary conditions; node_5 repositioned to improve geometry (forces and moments) and reduce demands on members 6 and 7. Using standard discrete area_ids ensures manufacturability and consistency. Mass constrained well below 30.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume linear elastic behavior: stresses proportional to forces in members. Calculate member lengths via Euclidean distance (for mass: length × area from dict). Estimate forces via equilibrium at joints (sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0). Mass = sum length*area DensityFactor (area_id mapped according to provided values), max_stress taken from max(abs(member force)/area) using previous FEM data as bases. Trial node_5 at 4.10,0.00 coordinates to reroute forces properly. Confirm constraints: stress-to-weight ≤1, mass ≤30.",

    "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1=(0.00,0.00), node_2=(6.00,0.00), node_3=(2.00,0.00), node_4=(2.00,2.40), node_5=(4.10,0.00). Member lengths recalculated with new node_5; areas selected from area_id as in historical best. Sum member masses <=16.45. Maximum |stress|max ~7.09, total mass ~16.45, resulting in 0.431 stress-to-weight, well below limit. All nodes connected. All supports and loads unchanged.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "Reviewed node and member assignments, verified no constraints violations. Structure is closed, connected, and stable. Design balances stress and weight optimally based on historical data and design rules. No floating nodes; no constraints breached; all members continuous with discrete area choices.",
