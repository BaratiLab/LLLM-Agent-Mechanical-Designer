No existing truss; generating optimal connections/nodes for minimal unilateral stresses while maintaining closure and static stability.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes at (0,0), (6,0), and (2,0) representing supports and load application with load on node_3 directed diagonally. The truss must be closed and connected. The classical three colinear nodes provide no geometric stiffness or closure; required to introduce at least one new node out-of-line to allow triangulation which improves structural response. The max stress / weight ratio <=1 constraint restricts allowing members to be overloaded or oversized unnecessarily, and total mass <=30 limits total cross section usage.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Node_1 has pinned support (fixed in x,y), node_2 roller (vertical restraint), node_3 roller (vertical restraint). The load at node_3 is -15.0 magnitude, 30° downward from horizontal (vector approximately (-12.99, -7.5) N). With three colinear nodes, no triangulation, causing instability and bending (not allowed here as truss). Introducing one elevated (off-line) node will form stable closed triangular panel(s). Optimal structure will funnel load paths into these tension/compression diagonals triangulating the base. Members\' selection from discrete area mass sets ensures mass and stress controlling. Expect direct compression in verticals and tension trends diagonally to resist applied load. Failure modes include buckling of compression members (to be minimized by area choice) or exceedance of stress due to insufficient area.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Key observation is node_3\'s location (2,0) near base line forms weak node in lateral stability alone. Introducing a node above node_3 planned to triangulate with node_1 and node_2, creates two triangles, a classic stable arrangement. The new “apex” node’s coordinate must be precise to optimize member lengths and load path angle. Use symmetry: build vertical member at node_3 extending upward, then connect that apex node to node_1 and node_2 forming an isosceles triangle. Check mass and stresses with minimal area assignment to chords and diagonal. Member selection from low to moderate areas based upon their role; verticals in compression > diagonals in tension.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Propose a quadrilateral closed truss formed by nodes node_1, node_2, node_3, and a new node_4 vertically above node_3 at optimized height to minimize length and distribute forces efficiently. Connect node_4 to node_1 and node_2 forming two diagonals along with base horizontal chord. Add vertical from node_3 to node_4. This arrangement promotes good triangulation, distributes load to supports primarily via short compression and tension members limiting stresses. Cross sections assigned per member function: vertical and short compression members with larger area, diagonals smaller area tension members, horizontal chord balanced. This balanced approach meets stress/weight ratio and total mass constraints.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic truss members, axial stress only. Force balance at nodes: sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0. Use right triangle geometry for member length calculation. Find node_4 y such that angles maintain optimal tension/compression loads and minimal length to reduce weight. Use hypotenuse lengths with triangle calculus. Calculate member forces by static equilibrium equations node by node including reactions at support nodes (node_1 pinned fully fixed, node_2 vertical only). Choose areas starting with low IDs, increase if stress tolerance violated. Total mass = Σ member length × selected area; Max stress from axial force / area. Iterate area selections.
