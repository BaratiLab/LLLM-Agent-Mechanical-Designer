Objective: minimize max stress/weight ratio under given load and boundary conditions.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given 3 nodes aligned mostly on x-axis with a load downward to left at node_3. Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 and node_3. Need closed truss (closed polygon) — current 3 nodes form a triangle but colinear positions of node_1, node_2, and node_3 violate stiffness and load path quality. Closed with a single new node above provides triangulation for stiffness.",\n    \n    "analysis": "With node_3 loaded (-15 N at -30deg = approx. Fx=-12.99, Fy=-7.5), supports are reactive at node_1 (pinned) and rollers at nodes 2 and 3. Because node_3 is also roller, structure must resist load with stable triangulation. Current layout is mostly linearly spaced nodes on base line => poor stiffness, very high stress in members. Introducing a new node above node_3 and connecting with members forms closed triangulated polygon distributing forces through diagonal tension/compression. Heavy members near load point, smaller cross-section members elsewhere help minimize total mass while satisfying stresses. Use mid-to-low area IDS for shorter members, higher for longer or loaded members respects mass restrictions (<= 30). Weight roughly calculated length * area. The load path is from loaded node_3 up to new node_4 then to supports at ends.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding one node above node_3 around (2.8, 3.0) creates 2 triangles enclosing apex, avoids colinearity, stiffens the frame. Connect node_4 back to node_1 and 2 for efficient load distribution. Choice of smaller area for base but larger at diagonal compression or tension members near load to keep stresses controlled. The combined lengths times areas capped at 30 total mass. Stress proportional to load path length and axial forces computed by static equilibrium. No redundant members, single triangular loop assures closed structure, no duplicates.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation principle: adding node_4 approx (2.8, 3.0) above node_3 to create triangles: {1-4-3}, {4-2-3}. Members: (1-4), (4-3), (3-2), (2-1), and original (1-3) too for rigid base. Load from node_3 compresses or pulls 2 diagonal members (4-3), (4-2), spreads to supports at nodes 1 and 2 through 1-4 and 2-1. Adopt area_id higher (5 or 6) for high stress diagonal members (4-3),(4-2), medium area (2-4) or (1-4), small area (to save weight) for base horizontal (2-1). Calculate member lengths and validate stresses ensure weekly of total actual / weight <1.0.

Members in only axial loading. Use static equilibrium of nodes: Fx=0, Fy=0 at each internal node. Area IDs mapped to cross-sectional areas as given: \'0\': 1, \'1\': 0.195, etc. For calculations: member mass = length * area, mass limit = 30 units sum. Stresses approximate from axial force/cross section area. Load vector components are Fx, Fy calculated from force magnitude and direction (given -30°).
