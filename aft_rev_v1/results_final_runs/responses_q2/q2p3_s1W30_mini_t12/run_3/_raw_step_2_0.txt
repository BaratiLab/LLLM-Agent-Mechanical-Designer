Current iteration fails stress-to-weight ratio and mass needs to be under 30. Objective is a fully triangulated closed truss minimizing stress concentration and mass while meeting constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3: (-15, -30) creates large tensile and compressive stresses. Supports constrain translations, providing fixed reactions. Stress-to-weight ratio is 1.8207 (constraint is ≤1.0). Mass is 23.72 < 30, but stress excessively high. Previous history shows member_3 highly stressed, likely tension in diagonal spanning node_3 to node_2. Design needs stronger triangulation and better force paths.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure with 5 nodes and irregular member areas has stress concentrations in member_3 (43.19 max stress) and member_9 (30.98 stress). Mass distribution shows very uneven use of cross-sectional areas, with some large area members (area_3=1.759, area_2=0.782) but lightweight members experiencing high stresses - sign of inefficient load path and member selection. Provided history structure #1 features 4 nodes and large diagonal member_5 providing direct load path across nodes 1 and 3 resulted in better stress balance albeit higher mass. Constraint violation mainly from a poorly supported node_3 and a tilt in load path causing shear in member_3, which is a short member with minimal area 1. Design lacks closed triangulation especially at the upper nodes causing bending stress build-up.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Load is out-of-plane for current members between node_3 and 2. Member lengths and location of node_4 and node_5 add complexity. Excessive mass in some large members but insufficient area in critically stressed ones is main deficiency. Closed triangular connectivity must be ensured to stabilize structures, reduce bending, and distribute load forces. Node_5 adds little stability or relief, sequentially producing high local stress in members connecting it. Simplifying nodes and adding a key tension/compression diagonal is vital.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Use a cleaner 4-node arrangement: Preserve nodes with loads and supports (node_1, node_2, node_3), reposition node_4 vertically to create a symmetric spaced triangular truss. Use this simple four-node diamond shape with diagonal member across node_1 to node_3 optimizing load transfer. Increase area of highly loaded diagonal from node_1 to node_3 and from top node_4 to node_2 and node_3. Remove node_5 to reduce complexity and mass. This closed diamond triangulation and improved area allocation will minimize stresses and mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A symmetric diamond truss (node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (~3,3)) forms 4 triangles distributing load efficiently. Load at node_3 pulls tensile stress through diagonal node_1-node_3 and compressive through node_4-node_3 and node_4-node_2. Pinned and roller supports support vertical and horizontal forces how defined. Increasing area of diagonals optimizes strength-to-weight ratio because primary load paths carry largest force. Simplifying and removing nodes reduces unnecessary mass and complexity improving feasibility.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Use truss ideal axial stress. Length calc by Euclidean distance. Use member area from given area_id dict {\'0\':1, \'1\':0.195, \'2\':0.782, \'3\':1.759}.
