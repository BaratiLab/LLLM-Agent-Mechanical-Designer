Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller, node_3 roller. Load is -15.0 at -30° (towards left-down). Constraints: max stress_to_weight ≤ 1, mass ≤ 30, areas from given set. Aim is a closed truss, meaning a fully triangulated structure between nodes.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current straight-line node arrangement (0,0), (2,0), (6,0) is not stable alone under lateral load. A closed truss (triangle) formed by nodes would provide lateral stability and efficient load paths. Support at node_1 restrains translations; node_2 and node_3 rollers allow horizontal movement only in vertical or horizontal direction respectively. Triangular shape stabilizes three nodes with mutual triangulation. Maximum force will appear along member connecting node_3 to the new upper node angled opposite load, and this upper node should help transfer forces efficiently reducing bending/stress into axial tension-compression in members. Choose cross-sectional areas increasing with member length and force intensity. Estimate mass from lengths * area and check stress-to-weight ratio considering load transfer through members.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Because node_3 has a diagonal load, placing a new apex node above the line will distribute stresses well. Stronger areas on long/Apex-to-bases; lighter on short bases. Achieve closed polygon with four nodes to improve shape and guarantee load distribution. Load path splits twice from node_3 upwards and either side to the supports. Wider triangles reduce compressive stress. Aim to keep total weight < 30 and stress ratio < 1 by selecting smaller areas on shorter members and higher on longer/heavily stressed members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Add one elevated node (node_4) symmetrically ~above node_3 in y-direction at x=2 (near load). Connect node_4 to node_1, node_2, and node_3 forming 3 new members plus the original base members (node_1-node_2, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3). This forms a truss with four nodes and thus 6 members, a simple stable structure. Use triangulation to eliminate bending moments. Area choices will be bigger on longer members (node_4 to base nodes) and smaller on bases to balance mass and stresses. Keep node_4 no higher than needed to avoid excessive member length increasing mass. Assume nodes fixed as given except newly added node is minor height shift at x=2. Use trigonometric equilibrium for simplicity.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members behave as axial; Load vector neg (15*cos30°, 15*sin30°) = (-12.99, -7.5). Node_1 pinned anchorage carries reaction forces. Node_2, node_3 rollers provide just vertical reactions: verify zero horizontal displacement at node_1 with force equilibrium. Calculate each member length: base members node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_2-node_3 = 4.0, node_1-node_2=6. Calculate node_4 (~2, y), estimate y=2.0 as reasonable. Lengths: node_4-node_1 = sqrt((2-0)^2 + (2-0)^2)=2.83, node_4-node_2 = sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-2)^2)=4.47, node_4-node_3=2.0. Select areas from given list keyed by IDs.
