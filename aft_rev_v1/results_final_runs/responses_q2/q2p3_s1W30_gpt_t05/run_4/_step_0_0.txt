    "preamble": "This problem requires designing a closed, fully connected 2D truss using three given nodes (with the option to add new nodes), specified supports, and a significant downward and leftward load at node_3. The goal is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio while ensuring all constraints on mass and stress are met. The structure must be statically stable, efficient, and triangulated for optimal load transfer.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three nodes: node_1 (pinned, left), node_2 (roller, right), node_3 (roller, between 1 and 2, loaded heavily down and left). The truss must be closed and all nodes connected. Area IDs correspond to cross-sectional areas for mass and stress calculations. Constraints are: stress-to-weight ratio <= 1.0, total mass <= 30, all nodes connected. Triangulation is essential for stability. Consider adding a fourth node above the base to form a triangle, minimizing member length and maximizing load distribution.",
    
    "analysis": "The truss must resist a strong downward/leftward load at node_3. With only the base nodes, the structure would be a line or open triangle, both unstable or inefficient. Adding a node above the base (forming a triangle with the base nodes) will create a classic stable truss. By placing this node (node_4) above the centroid of the base, load paths are shortened, and member forces are reduced. The supports (pinned at node_1 and rollers at node_2 and node_3) must be respected. Members should connect all nodes to ensure closure.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "A triangle with nodes 1, 2, and 4 (apex) provides structural depth. Connecting node_3 (the loaded node) to node_4 ensures direct load transfer. All four nodes are then connected, forming two triangles (1-3-4 and 2-3-4) sharing the apex (node_4) and base (node_1-node_2). This configuration efficiently distributes the load from node_3 to both supports. Member areas can be minimized except for those directly under high load (node_3 to node_4 and node_3 to base), which may need higher area.",
    
    "reasoning": "Symmetrical triangulation using a fourth node above the base will create two strong triangles, minimizing member lengths and maximizing load transfer efficiency. The apex node (node_4) should be positioned vertically above node_3 for optimal load path, with x=2.0 (aligned with node_3), y chosen to balance force magnitudes and keep member lengths reasonable. Area IDs are chosen to keep mass low but ensure members under highest stress (from node_3) have sufficient area. All nodes are connected, and no duplicate members exist.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume steel-like material (for area vs. stress scaling). Place node_4 at (2.0, 2.5) above node_3. Members: (1-2), (2-3), (3-1) close the base; (1-4), (2-4), (3-4) form upper triangles. Calculate member lengths using distance formula. Assign area_id '2' (0.782) to base and diagonals, area_id '4' (3.128) to member 3-4 (directly loaded). Compute mass as sum(length × area). Estimate max member force as the resultant at node_3, divided among connected members by geometry. Compute stress = force/area; stress-to-weight ratio = max(abs(stress))/total_mass.",
    
    "calculation": "Node positions: node_1 (0.0, 0.0), node_2 (6.0, 0.0), node_3 (2.0, 0.0), node_4 (2.0, 2.5). Member lengths: 1-2 = 6.0, 2-3 = 4.0, 3-1 = 2.0, 1-4 = sqrt((2)^2 + (2.5)^2) ≈ 3.20, 2-4 = sqrt((4)^2 + (2.5)^2) ≈ 4.72, 3-4 = 2.5. Assign area_id: (1-2, 2-3, 3-1, 1-4, 2-4) = '2' (0.782), (3-4) = '4' (3.128). Mass: (6+4+2+3.20+4.72)*0.782 + 2.5*3.128 ≈ (19.92)*0.782 + 7.82 ≈ 15.58 + 7.82 ≈ 23.40 < 30. Max force at node_3 is resultant sqrt(15^2 + 30^2) ≈ 33.54, mostly in member 3-4. Stress in 3-4: 33.54/3.128 ≈ 10.73. Stress-to-weight: 10.73/23.40 ≈ 0.46 < 1.0. All constraints satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Design meets all requirements: closed triangulated truss, all nodes connected, mass and stress-to-weight within limits. Member areas are minimized except for the one under maximum load. Node_4 placement is optimal for load path. All member connections are unique and necessary for stability.",
