The goal is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio while ensuring all constraints on mass and stress are met. The structure must be statically stable, efficient, and triangulated for optimal load transfer.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three nodes: node_1 (pinned, left), node_2 (roller, right), node_3 (roller, between 1 and 2, loaded heavily down and left). The truss must be closed and all nodes connected. Area IDs correspond to cross-sectional areas for mass and stress calculations. Constraints are: stress-to-weight ratio <= 1.0, total mass <= 30, all nodes connected. Triangulation is essential for stability. Consider adding a fourth node above the base to form a triangle, minimizing member length and maximizing load distribution.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The truss must resist a strong downward/leftward load at node_3. With only the base nodes, the structure would be a line or open triangle, both unstable or inefficient. Adding a node above the base (forming a triangle with the base nodes) will create a classic stable truss. By placing this node (node_4) above the centroid of the base, load paths are shortened, and member forces are reduced. The supports (pinned at node_1 and rollers at node_2 and node_3) must be respected. Members should connect all nodes to ensure closure.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "A triangle with nodes 1, 2, and 4 (apex) provides structural depth. Connecting node_3 (the loaded node) to node_4 ensures direct load transfer. All four nodes are then connected, forming two triangles (1-3-4 and 2-3-4) sharing the apex (node_4) and base (node_1-node_2). This configuration efficiently distributes the load from node_3 to both supports. Member areas can be minimized except for those directly under high load (node_3 to node_4 and node_3 to base), which may need higher area.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Symmetrical triangulation using a fourth node above the base will create two strong triangles, minimizing member lengths and maximizing load transfer efficiency. The apex node (node_4) should be positioned vertically above node_3 for optimal load path, with x=2.0 (aligned with node_3), y chosen to balance force magnitudes and keep member lengths reasonable. Area IDs are chosen to keep mass low but ensure members under highest stress (from node_3) have sufficient area. All nodes are connected, and no duplicate members exist.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume steel-like material (for area vs. stress scaling). Place node_4 at (2.0, 2.5) above node_3. Members: (1-2), (2-3), (3-1) close the base; (1-4), (2-4), (3-4) form upper triangles. Calculate member lengths using distance formula. Assign area_id \'2\' (0.782) to base and diagonals, area_id \'4\' (3.128) to member 3-4 (directly loaded). Compute mass as sum(length × area). Estimate max member force as the resultant at node_3, divided among connected members by geometry.
