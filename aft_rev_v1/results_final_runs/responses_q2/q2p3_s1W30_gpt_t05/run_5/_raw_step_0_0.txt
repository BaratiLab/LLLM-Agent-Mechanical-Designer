The goal is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio (max(abs(stress))/total_weight) while ensuring the structure is closed (all nodes connected), with total mass ≤ 30 units and stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 1.0. The truss must be both efficient and robust under the given loading and support conditions.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three nodes in a nearly collinear configuration with node_3 offset, node_1 is pinned, node_2 and node_3 are rollers. The only load is at node_3, acting left and down. The truss must be closed, so all nodes must be interconnected. The solution must use only the specified area IDs and keep the total mass under 30, with a stress-to-weight ratio not exceeding 1.0. Triangulation is likely needed for stability.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The supports (pinned at node_1, roller at node_2 and node_3) suggest the structure needs to transfer horizontal and vertical loads efficiently. The load at node_3 is significant and not aligned with any member, so direct load paths are critical. With only three nodes, the minimal closed truss is a triangle connecting all nodes. This provides geometric stability, but the member between node_1 and node_2 is long and will likely see high forces. The challenge is to select areas that balance stress and mass, while keeping the structure light and within the stress-to-weight constraint.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "With only three nodes, the only possible closed truss is the triangle. All three members must be present. The member between node_1 and node_2 is the longest and will likely be most critical for stress. The member between node_1 and node_3 will directly resist the downward and leftward force at node_3. The member between node_2 and node_3 helps triangulate and transfer load to node_2. To minimize stress-to-weight, assign larger areas to the highly stressed members and smaller areas to less critical ones, but keep total mass under 30.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A triangular truss is statically determinate and provides the minimal closed structure. Triangulation ensures stability under the given asymmetric load. To optimize, select the area IDs to just satisfy the stress-to-weight constraint, with the largest area for the most stressed member (likely node_1-node_3), medium for node_1-node_2, and smallest for node_2-node_3, while keeping mass within 30. No new nodes are needed; adding nodes would increase mass without significant benefit given the constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume all members are made of the same material (unit density for mass calculation). Compute member lengths: node_1-node_2 = 6.0, node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_2-node_3 = 4.0. Assign area IDs: try \'4\' (3.128) for node_1-node_3, \'3\' (1.759) for node_1-node_2, \'1\' (0.195) for node_2-node_3. Calculate mass = sum(length × area). Estimate forces using static equilibrium: resolve the external force at node_3, use method of joints. Compute stresses (force/area). Check max(abs(stress))/total_mass ≤ 1.0 and total mass ≤ 30. Adjust areas if necessary.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: L_12 = 6.0, L_13 = 2.0, L_23 = 4.0. Assign areas: A_13 = 3.128 (\'4\'), A_12 = 1.759 (\'3\'), A_23 = 0.195 (\'1\'). Mass = 6.0×1.759 + 2.0×3.128 + 4.0×0.195 = 10.554 + 6.256 + 0.78 = 17.59 (well under 30). For equilibrium at node_3: external force is (-15, -30). Members 13 and 23 are at angles; using geometry, set up joint equilibrium at node_3. Solving, member 1-3 sees the largest force (tension), member 2-3 in compression, member 1-2 in tension. Approximate max force in member 1-3 as sqrt(15^2 + 30^2) = 33.54. Stress_13 = 33.54/3.128 = 10.73. Stress-to-weight ratio = 10.73/17.59 = 0.61 (<1.0).
