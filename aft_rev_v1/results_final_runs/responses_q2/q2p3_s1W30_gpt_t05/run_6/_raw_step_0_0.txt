The objective is to minimize the ratio of maximum member stress to total truss weight, while keeping mass under 30 units and the stress-to-weight ratio at or below 1.0.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The truss must be closed and fully connected. Three supports (pinned at node_1, rollers at node_2 and node_3) are given, with a significant off-axis load at node_3. The three nodes are collinear (all y=0), which is structurally unstable for a truss; thus, at least one new node off the x-axis is needed for triangulation and stability. Members must be chosen to minimize force/mass ratio, and all area_ids must be selected from the allowed set.",\n    \n    "analysis": "With all original nodes collinear, no stable truss can be formed. To close and stabilize the truss, a new node above the x-axis (e.g., at the centroid or above node_3) is required to form a triangle. The load at node_3 is both leftward and downward, so the new node should be placed such that members can efficiently resolve both load components. Triangulation is key for stability and optimal force distribution. The supports are statically determinate (2+1+1=4 reactions for 3 nodes), so a simple triangle is optimal. Member areas should be minimized while keeping stresses within constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key insight: A single triangle (nodes 1, 2, 3 plus a new node_4 above) is the most efficient, minimal-mass structure. Placing node_4 above node_3 (e.g., (2.0, 2.5)) allows direct load transfer and efficient triangulation. All three base nodes must connect to node_4. Members: (1-3), (2-3), (1-2), (1-4), (2-4), (3-4) ensures closure. Member areas should be assigned based on estimated force magnitudes (longest, most loaded members get larger areas).",\n    \n    "reasoning": "To minimize the stress-to-weight ratio, all members should be loaded efficiently and the structure should be as compact as possible. By placing node_4 at (2.0, 2.5), a near-equilateral triangle forms with node_3, and all members are relatively short, minimizing mass. The triangle (1-2-4) braces the base, while (3-4) carries the load from node_3. Assign larger area to the member most likely to see the highest force (probably (3-4)), and smaller areas to less critical members. This configuration resolves all loads and satisfies closure. All node coordinates are precise floats.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All members are pin-jointed, loads applied statically. Material is uniform; mass = sum(length × area). Use trigonometry to compute member lengths. Estimate member forces by hand (using method of joints at node_3 and node_4). Assign area_ids so that stress (force/area) in each member ≤ max(abs(stress)), and total mass ≤ 30. For simplicity, use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for most members, area_id \'4\' (3.128) for the most loaded member (3-4).
