    "preamble": "This task involves designing a closed, optimized 2D truss using three provided nodes, specific support and load conditions, and a discrete set of cross-sectional areas. The goal is to minimize the maximum stress-to-weight ratio (max(abs(stress))/total_weight), ensuring all constraints are satisfied, especially mass and stress-to-weight ratio limits. All nodes must be connected, and the structure must be statically and structurally sound.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), with a downward and leftward load at node_3, and specific supports. Objective: closed, minimal stress-to-weight ratio structure, mass <= 30, ratio <= 1.0. No prior design exists. Triangulation is key for stability, and all nodes must be connected—likely a triangle, but member sizing and possible new node addition are to be considered.",
    
    "analysis": "node_1 is pinned (full restraint), node_2 and node_3 are rollers (vertical or horizontal restraint only). The load at node_3 (-15, -30) is substantial and not aligned with any member, so direct force paths are critical. The three nodes are colinear (all y=0), which is structurally inefficient—no vertical height means no triangulation, and thus, no ability to resist vertical loads through axial forces. This structure would be a mechanism, not a truss. Therefore, at least one node must be added off the x-axis to allow triangulation and force transfer, especially for the vertical load component.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "The colinear original nodes cannot resist vertical load via truss action. Adding a node above the x-axis (forming a triangle) will enable triangulation and efficient force transfer. Placing the new node above node_3 (or between node_1 and node_2) will allow direct load path for the applied force at node_3, minimizing member forces and, thus, stress-to-weight ratio. The triangle should be as equilateral as possible for force distribution, but must also keep member lengths reasonable to stay within mass constraints.",
    
    "reasoning": "To ensure a closed, stable truss, add node_4 at (2.0, 2.5) above node_3, forming a triangle with all original nodes. This enables triangulation, direct load path from node_3 to node_4, and efficient distribution of both horizontal and vertical forces. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_2-node_1 (base triangle), plus node_3-node_4, node_4-node_1, node_4-node_2 (forming two triangles sharing node_3-node_4). Use minimal area for less-stressed members, and larger area for highly stressed members (e.g., node_3-node_4, which directly carries the applied load).",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All members are pin-jointed, loads are static, and only axial forces are present. Areas are chosen from the given discrete set. Calculate member lengths via distance formula. Estimate forces using method of joints (node_3 is loaded, so start there). For mass: sum(length × area) for all members. For stress: use force/area for each member. Members carrying the largest share of the load (especially node_3-node_4) should have the largest area. Ensure total mass <= 30 and stress-to-weight ratio <= 1.0.",
    
    "calculation": "Place node_4 at (2.0, 2.5). Member lengths: node_3-node_4 = 2.5; node_1-node_3 = 2.0; node_2-node_3 = 4.0; node_1-node_4 = sqrt((2-0)^2 + (2.5-0)^2) ≈ 3.20; node_2-node_4 = sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-2.5)^2) ≈ 4.72; node_1-node_2 = 6.0. Assign areas: node_3-node_4 ('10': 19.548, as it carries the main load), node_1-node_3 and node_2-node_3 ('3': 1.759), node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4 ('2': 0.782), node_1-node_2 ('2': 0.782). Mass = sum(length × area): (2.5×19.548)+(2.0×1.759)+(4.0×1.759)+(3.20×0.782)+(4.72×0.782)+(6.0×0.782) ≈ 48.87+3.52+7.04+2.50+3.69+4.69 = 70.31. Mass is too high, so reduce areas. Try node_3-node_4 ('7': 9.578), others ('1': 0.195). New mass: (2.5×9.578)+(2.0×0.195)+(4.0×0.195)+(3.20×0.195)+(4.72×0.195)+(6.0×0.195) ≈ 23.95+0.39+0.78+0.62+0.92+1.17 = 27.83. Now, estimate stress: node_3-node_4 carries most of the applied load: sqrt(15^2+30^2)=33.54, stress = 33.54/9.578 ≈ 3.50. Stress-to-weight ratio = 3.50/27.83 ≈ 0.13 < 1.0. All constraints satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Final check: All nodes connected, structure is triangulated and stable, mass = 27.83 < 30, stress-to-weight ratio = 0.13 < 1.0, all members reference unique nodes, and only allowed area IDs are used. No duplicate nodes or members. All constraints and objectives are met.",
