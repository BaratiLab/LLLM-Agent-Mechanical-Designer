The objective is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio (max(|stress|)/total_weight), ensuring all constraints are satisfied: stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 1.0, total mass ≤ 30, and all nodes are connected. The current best design achieves a ratio of 0.646 with a mass of 20.22. The historic best ratio is 0.485 but with a heavier mass (29.51).",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs confirm a statically determinate truss with three supports (pinned at node_1, rollers at nodes 2/3), and a significant load at node_3. The current design is efficient in mass but not optimal in stress-to-weight ratio. History shows a structure with a better ratio but higher mass, and lighter structures violate constraints due to high stress.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure uses nodes above the base to create two upper chords, forming a polygonal (closed) truss. Members are mostly area_id \'2\', except one (area_id \'1\'). The most stressed member is member_5 (node_1-node_3), which carries nearly the entire applied load. The historic best design (rank_1) shifts upper nodes higher and to the right, increasing member lengths and mass but reducing the stress-to-weight ratio. Lighter, more vertical structures tend to fail constraints due to excessive stress in members directly under the load.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The trade-off is between mass and stress: lighter designs overstress key members, while heavier designs distribute load better but approach the mass constraint. The current design\'s main inefficiency is the direct transfer of load from node_3 to node_1 (member_5), leading to a high stress-to-weight ratio. The historic best achieves better distribution by raising the upper nodes, increasing the lever arm for load transfer. To improve, we can adjust node_4 and node_5 upward and outward, and consider using a lighter area (area_id \'1\') for less critical members, while ensuring member_5 is robust.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Propose to optimize the current design by raising node_4 and node_5 slightly (towards the historic best, but not as far to avoid excess mass), and reassigning member areas: use area_id \'3\' for member_5 (node_1-node_3), area_id \'1\' for the lightly stressed top chord (node_4-node_5), and area_id \'2\' elsewhere. This should reduce stress in member_5, distribute load more efficiently, and keep mass below 30.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Raising node_4 and node_5 increases the height of the truss, lengthening compression/tension diagonals and reducing force in the most stressed member. Assigning larger area to member_5 (directly under the load) reduces its stress, while using minimal areas for top chord and less loaded diagonals saves mass. The structure remains closed and triangulated for stability. All supports and loaded nodes remain fixed per constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Key assumptions: node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed; only move node_4 and node_5. Set node_4 at (2.5, 3.3), node_5 at (4.2, 3.3) (compromise between current and historic best). Assign area_id \'3\' to member_5, area_id \'1\' to member_3 (top chord), area_id \'2\' to others. Estimate member lengths, then mass = sum(length × area). Stresses: member_5 now has lower stress due to increased area and better geometry. Check if max(|stress|)/mass < 0.646 and mass < 30.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: member_5 (node_1-node_3) = 2.0, member_3 (node_4-node_5) ≈ 1.70, diagonals ≈ 3.5-4.0. Calculate masses: member_5 (2.0×1.759=3.52), member_3 (1.7×0.195=0.33), others (≈3.5×0.782=2.74 each). Total mass ≈ 3.52+0.33+2.74×6=20.99. Max stress in member_5 is reduced by increased area and improved geometry; estimate stress drops by ~25%, so new max(|stress|) ≈ 10.0. Stress-to-weight ratio ≈ 10.0/20.99 ≈ 0.477, which is better than both the current and historic best while keeping mass well below 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints satisfied: mass < 30, stress-to-weight ratio < 1.0.
