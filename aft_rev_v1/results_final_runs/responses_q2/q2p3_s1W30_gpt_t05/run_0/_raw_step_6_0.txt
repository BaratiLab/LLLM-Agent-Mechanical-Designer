The current design and several historic structures violate the stress-to-weight constraint (>1.0) and/or the mass constraint (>30). The objective is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio while ensuring max(abs(stress))/total_weight ≤ 1.0 and total mass ≤ 30, producing a closed, fully-connected truss.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "The current structure (iteration 5/25) is overweight (31.99 > 30) and overstressed (ratio 1.41 > 1.0). Historic best feasible structure (rank_1) nearly meets the mass constraint (29.51), and has a very low stress-to-weight ratio (0.485), but some members may be oversized. The load is large and eccentric, so careful triangulation and member area selection are crucial.",\n\n    "analysis": "The load at node_3 is significant (-15, -30), with supports at nodes 1 (pinned), 2 (roller), 3 (roller). The best historic structure (rank_1) uses a Warren truss pattern with two top chords (nodes 4 and 5) and diagonal bracing from node_3 to the top. The stress distribution is reasonable, with the highest member stress (-14.3) well below the constraint, and mass (29.51) under the limit. The current structure and other variants fail mainly from high stresses in bottom chord members (notably member_7, node_1-node_3) and overweighted upper bracing. Further, the closed truss is essential for stiffness and constraint satisfaction. The historic structure with node_4 at (2.5, 3.5) and node_5 at (4.5, 3.5) appears optimal, but some member areas could be reduced to further minimize mass while staying under the stress constraint.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: The best structure uses a symmetric Warren truss, with diagonals from node_3 to both top nodes, and top chord between them. Overweight members are in the upper bracing. The stress-to-weight ratio is low because high-stress members are short and/or have small area. Areas of concern: ensure all members are needed, avoid oversizing, and check that all nodes are closed. Insight: The historic best structure is nearly optimal, but could be improved by reducing area in lightly loaded members (e.g., member_6, top chord), and possibly shifting top chord nodes slightly lower to reduce lengths and mass.",\n\n    "proposal": "Adopt the historic best structure (rank_1) as a base, but optimize further by: (1) slightly lowering the top chord nodes to (2.5, 3.2) and (4.5, 3.2) to reduce member lengths and mass; (2) reducing member areas for lightly loaded members (e.g., member_6, top chord, and diagonals) to the minimum required to keep stresses below the limit; (3) verifying that all members are needed for closure and stability. This should yield a structure with mass < 30 and stress-to-weight ratio < 1.0.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Symmetry and triangulation ensure efficient load distribution. Lowering the top nodes reduces member length and mass. Using minimum sufficient area for each member prevents overdesign. Keeping the Warren truss pattern ensures all nodes are closed, and the load at node_3 is well-distributed to the supports. All supports and loaded nodes are fixed as required.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All supports and loads remain at original nodes. Area IDs are selected to keep max member stress ≤ mass × 1.0. Compute each member\'s force under load, estimate required area, and select the next higher available area ID. For lightly loaded members (e.g., top chord, upper diagonals), use smallest area that keeps stress below limit. For bottom chord and diagonals from node_3, use moderate area (1 or 2). Mass = sum(length × area) for all members. All nodes are connected, and no isolated members.",\n\n    "calculation": "Estimate member forces for each type: Bottom chord (node_1-node_3-node_2): highest tension, so use area_id \'2\' (0.782). Diagonals (node_3 to top nodes): moderate compression/tension, area_id \'2\'. Top chord (node_4-node_5): lower force, area_id \'1\' or \'2\'. Verticals (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_5): area_id \'1\'. Calculate lengths: bottom = 6.0, top = 2.0, diagonals ≈ sqrt((2.5-2.0)^2 + (3.2-0.0)^2) ≈ 3.25. Mass = sum(length × area). All stresses expected < 14, mass ≈ 1.17×1 + 2.54×1 + 2.54×1 + 3.25×2 + 3.25×2 + 2.0×1 + 4.0×2 + 2.0×1 = ~29.0.
