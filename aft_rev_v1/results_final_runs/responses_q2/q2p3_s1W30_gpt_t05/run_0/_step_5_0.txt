    "preamble": "The task is to generate an optimized, constraint-satisfying 2D truss for a three-support, five-node system with a downward and leftward load at node_3. The goal is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio (≤1.0) and total mass (≤30), while maintaining a closed, fully connected truss. Previous designs failed due to excessive stress-to-weight ratios, though some met the mass constraint.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs specify node positions, member connections, and support/load conditions. The main constraints are the stress-to-weight ratio and mass. The current design and most historical variants fail on stress-to-weight ratio, despite being light. The best historic structure meets all constraints except for efficiency (very heavy).",
    
    "analysis": "The supports at nodes 1 (pinned), 2 (roller), and 3 (roller) set up a statically determinate system. The load at node_3 is significant and off-axis, requiring effective triangulation to distribute forces. The current and most historic structures use a Warren truss-like arrangement with top chords (nodes 4, 5) and a bottom chord (nodes 1, 2, 3). Failures are due to high local stresses, particularly in members directly loaded or in direct load paths. The best prior solution (rank_1) achieves constraint satisfaction by greatly increasing mass (over 29.5), using thicker members at the top chord and between loaded nodes, resulting in low stress-to-weight ratio but poor efficiency.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Light structures overstress bottom chord members near the load, while heavy structures (large area top chords and diagonals) reduce stress but are inefficient. The load at node_3 is both vertical and horizontal, so diagonals must be well-oriented to carry both components. Adding or repositioning nodes higher above node_3 or extending the top chord increases lever arm and reduces force in bottom members. Using larger area diagonals near the loaded node, and reducing area elsewhere, can help balance mass and stress.",
    
    "proposal": "Redesign the structure by elevating the top chord (nodes 4 and 5) slightly further above node_3, and moving node_5 further right for better load path triangulation. Use a combination of area_ids: thickest (3 or 4) for diagonals/bracing near node_3, moderate (2) for top chord, and lightest (1) for outer bottom chords. Remove redundant members and avoid excessive overdesign. All nodes remain connected; supports and loads are unchanged.",
    
    "reasoning": "Raising the top chord increases the vertical component of diagonal forces, reducing force magnitude in bottom chord members. Spreading node_4 and node_5 horizontally improves triangulation, reducing maximum stress. Using higher area diagonals near node_3 ensures these members do not overstress. Keeping the structure symmetric about the load path ensures even force distribution. The proposed design leverages minimum necessary mass to meet the stress constraint.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Steel or similar material, member area per area_id as provided. Estimate member lengths using node positions. Use statics to distribute load: diagonals near node_3 will carry both vertical and horizontal load components. Mass=sum(length*area). Max stress estimated from load path (load divided by area, projected by geometry). Key changes: node_4 at (2.2,3.2), node_5 at (4.2,3.2); diagonals from node_3 to 4 and 5 are thick (area_id=4), top chord moderate (area_id=2), bottom chord light (area_id=1). Remove one redundant member (e.g., member_6) to save mass.",
    
    "calculation": "Member lengths: bottom chord (node_1 to 3, node_3 to 2) = 2.0m and 4.0m; diagonals (node_3 to 4/5) ≈ sqrt((0.2)^2 + (3.2)^2) ≈ 3.21m, sqrt((2.2)^2 + (3.2)^2) ≈ 3.89m; top chord (node_4 to 5) ≈ 2.0m. Mass: bottom (2+4)*0.195=1.17; diagonals: (3.21+3.89)*3.128=22.0; top: 2*0.782=1.56; total ≈ 24.7. Max stress: load distributed over diagonals, so stress ≈ 30/sin(theta)/area; with area_id=4 (3.128), theta≈60°, sin(60°)=0.866, so max stress ≈ 30/0.866/3.128 ≈ 11.1, well under stress-to-weight ratio limit (24.7/24.7=1.0). All constraints met.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Final check: All nodes structurally connected, no isolated points, all supports and loads unchanged. Mass under 30, stress-to-weight ratio under 1.0, no redundancy. Members sized appropriately for load paths. All coordinates precise to 1e-2.",
