All structural constraints, including a strict mass limit and a stress-to-weight ratio <= 1.0, must be satisfied. The design should use only the provided node positions, but may introduce new nodes if beneficial.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs specify three nodes at (0,0), (6,0), and (2,0). Node_1 is pinned, node_2 and node_3 are rollers. A significant load acts on node_3. Objective: connect all nodes, possibly with an additional node, to form a closed truss, minimize stress-to-weight ratio, and keep mass <= 30. Must select member areas from a discrete set.",\n\n    "analysis": "The structure is horizontally aligned, with all nodes at y=0. The load on node_3 is (-15, -30), i.e., leftward and downward. With all nodes colinear, a basic triangle is not possible unless a new node is added off the x-axis. Direct connections (e.g., node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3) would create a mechanism, not a stable truss. Thus, for triangulation and force distribution, a new node above the x-axis is essential. By placing a node above node_3 (say at (2,2)), we can connect all nodes into a single triangle, ensuring stability and efficient load transfer.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a node above the base (e.g., at (2,2)) forms a stable triangle: node_1, node_2, node_4 (new), with node_3 connected to node_4. This enables triangulation, reducing member forces and allowing for smaller areas. The load at node_3 can be resolved into the triangle, minimizing the maximum member stress. All supports remain as specified. The chosen geometry must keep member lengths reasonable to limit mass.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Triangulation is essential for stability. By adding node_4 at (2,2), we form two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4). This configuration distributes the applied load efficiently between vertical and diagonal members. Members from node_1 to node_4 and node_2 to node_4 act as compression/tension chords, while the base (node_1-node_2) acts as a tie. Member areas are chosen to balance stress and mass, using the smallest possible areas that keep stresses below the allowable threshold.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All joints are pinned, members only take axial loads. Material density is uniform (not specified, so mass is proportional to length × area). Forces resolved using static equilibrium. Calculate member lengths: node_1-(0,0), node_2-(6,0), node_3-(2,0), node_4-(2,2). Members: (1-2), (1-4), (2-4), (3-4), (1-3), (2-3). Assign area IDs starting from the smallest, increase if stress constraint is violated. Calculate member forces using method of joints (joint 3 first, as load is applied there). Sum member lengths × area for mass; max(abs(stress))/mass must be <= 1.0.",\n\n    "calculation": "Member lengths: 1-2 = 6.00, 1-4 = sqrt(2^2+2^2)=2.83, 2-4 = sqrt(4^2+2^2)=4.47, 3-4 = 2.00, 1-3 = 2.00, 2-3 = 4.00. Assign area_id \'2\' (A=0.782) to main diagonals, \'1\' (A=0.195) to shorter members. Estimate maximum member force by resolving load at node_3: vertical and horizontal components split between members (3-4, 1-3, 2-3). For safety, assign area_id \'2\' to 3-4, 1-3, 2-3; area_id \'1\' to 1-4, 2-4, and 1-2. Total mass ≈ (6+2.83+4.47)×0.195 + (2+2+4)×0.782 ≈ 2.56 + 6.26 = 8.82 < 30. Assume max force ≈ 30 (worst case), so max stress ≈ 30/0.782=38.4, stress-to-weight ratio = 38.4/8.82=4.36 >1.0. Increase area for most loaded member (3-4) to \'4\' (A=3.128): max stress = 30/3.128=9.6, ratio=9.6/11.13=0.86 <1.0. All constraints satisfied.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Final design: Four nodes (three original, one added at (2,2)). Six members for full triangulation and closure.
