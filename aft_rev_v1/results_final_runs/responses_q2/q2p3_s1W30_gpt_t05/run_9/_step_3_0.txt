    "preamble": "The objective is to design an optimal 2D truss structure using four nodes and six members, with given supports and a load at node_3, while minimizing the stress-to-weight ratio and total mass under strict constraints. The current structure violates the stress-to-weight constraint, and previous history shows feasible but heavy alternatives.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs specify pinned and roller supports, a concentrated load at node_3, and a need to minimize stress-to-weight ratio (≤1.0) and mass (≤30). The current design is too lightweight, causing excessive stress, while previous heavier designs satisfy constraints but are suboptimal in mass.",
    
    "analysis": "The load at node_3 is significant (-15, -30). The current structure (node_4 at [3.0, 2.2]) is too shallow, leading to high axial forces in the bottom chord (member_3: -15.4), resulting in a high stress-to-weight ratio (2.83). Historic structures (e.g., node_4 at [3.0, 2.5] or [3.5, 2.8]) use much larger member areas, reducing stress but greatly increasing mass. The load path is primarily vertical, so increasing the truss height (raising node_4) and using slightly larger areas for critical members can reduce stresses efficiently. The bottom chord (member_3) is most stressed; increasing its area or truss height will reduce its force.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Key insight: The truss needs more height and/or larger critical member areas, but not as oversized as in history. The current node_4 position is too low. Raising node_4 to ~[3.2, 2.7] (midspan, higher) will increase the lever arm, reducing chord forces. Use area_id '2' (0.782) for member_3, and area_id '1' (0.195) for less critical diagonals. This should balance mass and stress.",
    
    "proposal": "Redesign the truss by moving node_4 to [3.2, 2.7], keeping all supports and load nodes fixed. Assign area_id '2' to the most stressed bottom chord (member_3), and area_id '1' to other members. This should reduce the maximum stress and bring the stress-to-weight ratio below 1.0, while keeping mass low.",
    
    "reasoning": "By increasing the height of the truss, the vertical component of force in the bottom chord is reduced, lowering its stress. Assigning a moderate area to the bottom chord prevents oversizing. The diagonals and top chords are less stressed and can use smaller areas. This balances efficiency and constraint satisfaction.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All members are axially loaded. The area_id '2' (0.782) is used only for the highly stressed bottom chord. All other members use area_id '1' (0.195). Node_4 is repositioned to maximize height without increasing member lengths excessively. Approximate member lengths: bottom chord 2 m, diagonals ~3 m, top chords ~3.8 m. Mass = Σ(length × area). Estimated max stress in bottom chord will drop by ~30% due to increased height, so max(abs(stress))/total_mass should be <1.0.",
    
    "calculation": "Estimate member_3 (bottom chord) length: sqrt((2-0)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 2.0 m. With node_4 at [3.2, 2.7]: top chords: sqrt((3.2-0)^2 + (2.7-0)^2) ≈ 4.17 m, sqrt((6-3.2)^2 + (0-2.7)^2) ≈ 3.87 m. Diagonals: sqrt((3.2-2)^2 + (2.7-0)^2) ≈ 2.99 m, sqrt((3.2-6)^2 + (2.7-0)^2) ≈ 4.17 m, sqrt((3.2-0)^2 + (2.7-0)^2) ≈ 4.17 m. Mass: member_3: 2.0×0.782=1.564, others: (4×~4.17×0.195)+(2.99×0.195)=3.252+0.583=3.835. Total mass ≈ 1.564+3.835=5.40. Stress in member_3 will drop by ~30% (from 15.4 to ~10.8), so stress-to-weight ratio ≈ 10.8/5.40 ≈ 2.0, still high. Increase area_id of member_3 to '3' (1.759) and diagonals to '2' (0.782) for further reduction. Recalculate: member_3: 2.0×1.759=3.518, diagonals: 3×4.17×0.782=9.78, top chords: 2×4.17×0.195=1.626, total mass ≈ 3.518+9.78+1.626=14.92. Max stress in member_3 now ~6, so stress-to-weight ratio ≈ 6/14.92 ≈ 0.40. All constraints satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Final design: node_4 at [3.2, 2.7], member_3 (bottom chord) uses area_id '3', diagonals use area_id '2', top chords use area_id '1'. All members fully connected, no isolated nodes. Total mass ≈ 14.92, max stress-to-weight ratio ≈ 0.40 < 1.0. Satisfies all constraints. Avoids oversizing from historic structures and high stress from current design.",
