    "preamble": "The objective is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio of a closed 2D truss under given loads and supports, with all constraints satisfied. The current structure is valid but not optimal, as better stress-to-weight ratios have been achieved in previous iterations. The main challenge is balancing low mass with low maximum stress by smart node positioning and member sizing.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "The truss must remain closed, all nodes connected. Loads and supports are fixed and cannot be moved. The stress-to-weight ratio must be minimized, with all member stresses and total mass within constraints. Current design is feasible but not optimal; history shows a lower ratio is possible with a slightly heavier structure.",
    
    "analysis": "Reviewing the current and historic designs: current truss (node_4 at [3.2, 2.7]) achieves a stress-to-weight ratio of 0.4142 with a mass of 16.44, but the best historic design (node_4 at [3.0, 2.5]) achieves a lower ratio (0.2921) with a higher mass (22.18). Both use similar layouts, but the historic best uses slightly larger areas for some members, distributing forces more evenly and reducing peak stress. The lowest-mass design (node_4 at [3.5, 2.8]) has an unacceptably high stress-to-weight ratio. The key insight is that a slightly heavier, more balanced truss with optimized node_4 position and member areas yields the best result.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "The lowest stress-to-weight ratio is achieved with node_4 at [3.0, 2.5], using area_id '2' for most members and '3' for the most stressed ones. The current design is lighter but has a higher peak stress, suggesting it's under-designed for the critical member. The constraint on mass (<=30) is not limiting; thus, we can afford a bit more mass to further reduce peak stress.",
    
    "proposal": "Adopt the best historic structure (node_4 at [3.0, 2.5]) and fine-tune member areas: keep area_id '2' for most members but use area_id '3' for member_3 (the most stressed member, spanning node_3 to node_1) and member_6 (node_3 to node_4). This will further distribute the load, reduce max stress, and maintain a closed, efficient truss. No further node movement is warranted as the best geometry has already been found.",
    
    "reasoning": "Triangulation is optimal for distributing loads in 2D trusses. The symmetric placement of node_4 at [3.0, 2.5] ensures even load transfer between supports. Assigning larger areas to the most stressed members directly reduces their stress without a significant mass penalty, as most members remain at area_id '2'. This approach leverages the mass constraint and reduces the stress-to-weight ratio to a minimum given the geometry and loading.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All supports and loaded nodes remain fixed. Use area_id '2' (0.782) for most members; use area_id '3' (1.759) for member_3 and member_6. Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance. Verify total mass and stress-to-weight ratio. All nodes must be connected; no floating nodes.",
    
    "calculation": "Member lengths (approx):\n- member_1 (node_1-node_2): 6.00\n- member_2 (node_2-node_3): 4.00\n- member_3 (node_3-node_1): 2.00\n- member_4 (node_1-node_4): sqrt((3.0-0.0)^2 + (2.5-0.0)^2) ≈ 3.90\n- member_5 (node_2-node_4): sqrt((6.0-3.0)^2 + (0.0-2.5)^2) ≈ 3.90\n- member_6 (node_3-node_4): sqrt((3.0-2.0)^2 + (2.5-0.0)^2) ≈ 2.69\n\nMass = sum(length × area):\n- member_1: 6.00 × 0.782 ≈ 4.692\n- member_2: 4.00 × 0.782 ≈ 3.128\n- member_3: 2.00 × 1.759 ≈ 3.518\n- member_4: 3.90 × 0.782 ≈ 3.0538\n- member_5: 3.90 × 0.782 ≈ 3.0538\n- member_6: 2.69 × 1.759 ≈ 4.7363\nTotal mass ≈ 22.18\n\nFrom previous FEM results, max stress is 6.48, so stress-to-weight ratio ≈ 0.2921 (well within constraint). All constraints are satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints are satisfied, and the structure is already at the historic minimum stress-to-weight ratio. Node positions and member areas are optimal given the load and support configuration. No further meaningful improvements can be made without violating constraints or increasing the ratio.",
