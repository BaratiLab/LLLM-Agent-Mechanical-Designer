The main objective is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio (max(abs(stress))/total_weight), ensuring the truss is closed, meets a mass limit, and all constraints are satisfied.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three nodes in a nearly collinear arrangement, with node_3 receiving a significant off-axis load, and supports at all nodes. The truss must be closed (all nodes connected). The mass and stress-to-weight ratio must both be within strict limits. The initial structure will likely be a triangle, but additional nodes may improve performance by redistributing forces or shortening high-stress members.",\n\n    "analysis": "The supports at node_1 (pinned) and nodes_2,3 (rollers) mean the structure is statically determinate and can resist vertical/horizontal loads. The load at node_3 is large and off-axis, so direct load paths to supports are critical. A simple triangle (nodes 1-2-3) is the minimal closed truss, but the acute angle at node_3 may lead to high stresses in the member from node_3 to node_1. Triangulation or adding a node above the base could spread the load and reduce peak member stress, but must not violate the mass constraint.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "The key challenge is the large, oblique force at node_3 and the long span between nodes. A triangle is efficient for three nodes, but the stress in members could be high. Adding a fourth node above the base (forming two triangles) can reduce individual member stress by providing a vertical load path, but increases mass. The best solution likely balances these effects.",\n\n    "reasoning": "To minimize the stress-to-weight ratio, the structure should be triangulated, with members aligned with force paths. Adding a fourth node above the base (forming a \'roof\') will allow the load at node_3 to be shared by more members, reducing peak stress. This node will be placed above the centroid of the base triangle to minimize member lengths and maximize force efficiency. All members will use the smallest area IDs that keep stress within allowable limits. The structure will be fully closed, and all nodes will be interconnected.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All members are pin-jointed; self-weight is negligible compared to applied loads. Material is homogeneous, and strength is governed by axial stress. For each member: stress = force/area. Mass = sum(member_length × area). The force at node_3 will be resolved into the structure. The new node will be placed at (3.0, 2.5) (above the base, forming roughly equilateral triangles). The area ID for each member will be selected to keep stress below (mass × 1.0), and total mass below 30 units.",\n\n    "calculation": "Members: (1) node_1-node_2, (2) node_2-node_3, (3) node_3-node_1, (4) node_1-node_4, (5) node_2-node_4, (6) node_3-node_4. Member lengths: node_1-node_2 = 6.0, node_2-node_3 = 4.0, node_3-node_1 = 2.0, node_1-node_4 ≈ 3.90, node_2-node_4 ≈ 3.90, node_3-node_4 ≈ 2.92. Try area_id \'2\' (area=0.782) for all members. Total mass ≈ (6+4+2+3.90+3.90+2.92)*0.782 ≈ 17.82, well below 30. Estimate max member force (from statics, node_3 vertical/horizontal resolution): maximum member force ≈ 17.0. Max stress = 17.0 / 0.782 ≈ 21.74. Stress-to-weight ratio = 21.74 / 17.82 ≈ 1.22 (>1.0). Increase area for most loaded member (node_3-node_1) to area_id \'5\' (area=4.887). New mass ≈ (6+4+3.90+3.90+2.92)*0.782 + 2*4.0*4.887 ≈ 14.32 + 19.55 ≈ 33.87 (exceeds mass). Try area_id \'3\' (1.759) for node_3-node_1 and node_3-node_4, others at \'2\'. New mass ≈ (6+4+3.90+3.90)*0.782 + (2.0+2.92)*1.759 ≈ 13.41 + 8.73 ≈ 22.14. Max stress now ≈ 17.0/1.759 ≈ 9.67. Stress-to-weight ratio = 9.67/22.14 ≈ 0.44 (<1.0).
