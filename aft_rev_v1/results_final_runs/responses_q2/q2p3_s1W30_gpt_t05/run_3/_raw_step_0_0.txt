The design must ensure all nodes are connected, forces are efficiently transferred, and the structure is triangulated for stability.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "We have three colinear nodes at (0,0), (2,0), (6,0) with node_1 pinned, node_2 and node_3 rollers. A downward and leftward load is applied at node_3. The truss must be closed, so at least a triangle is needed. Triangulation is critical for structural stability. Mass and stress-to-weight must be strictly controlled.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The three initial nodes are colinear, which is not ideal for triangulation or stability. A direct connection between all three would not resist out-of-plane forces. To close the truss and improve load distribution, at least one new node off the x-axis is needed. The load at node_3 has both x and y components, so the structure must provide resistance in both directions. The most efficient pattern is a triangle with an apex above the x-axis.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The challenge is to introduce a single new node (node_4) above the x-axis, forming two triangles. This will allow force transfer from node_3 to both supports. The new node should be placed to minimize member length (and thus mass) while optimizing the angle of force transfer to reduce member stress. The area IDs must be chosen to balance stress and mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Placing node_4 at the centroid of the triangle formed by the given nodes, but above the x-axis, will ensure symmetry and efficient force distribution. Connecting node_4 to all three original nodes will form two triangles. Members from node_3 to node_4 and node_2 to node_4 will carry the vertical and horizontal components of the load, reducing stress in each member. The supports at node_1 and node_2 will then efficiently resist the applied load.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume node_4 at (4.0, 2.5) for a compact triangle. Members: (node_1, node_2), (node_2, node_3), (node_3, node_1), (node_1, node_4), (node_2, node_4), (node_3, node_4). Calculate lengths, assign area IDs (starting with \'2\' for main members, increasing if stress ratio too high), calculate member forces by resolving the applied load, then compute stresses and total mass. Adjust area IDs if constraints not met.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: (node_1, node_2): 6.0; (node_2, node_3): 4.0; (node_3, node_1): 2.0; (node_1, node_4): sqrt((4-0)^2 + (2.5-0)^2) = 4.72; (node_2, node_4): sqrt((4-6)^2 + (2.5-0)^2) = 3.20; (node_3, node_4): sqrt((4-2)^2 + (2.5-0)^2) = 3.20. Assign area_id \'2\' (0.782) to all except (node_1, node_2), which gets \'3\' (1.759) due to longer span.
