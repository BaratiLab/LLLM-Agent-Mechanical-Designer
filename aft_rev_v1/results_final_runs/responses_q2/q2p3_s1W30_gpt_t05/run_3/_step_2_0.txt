    "preamble": "The task is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio (max(abs(stress))/total_weight) of a closed 2D truss structure with fixed loads and supports, while ensuring all constraints (stress-to-weight ≤ 1.0, total mass ≤ 30) are satisfied. The current design has a ratio of 0.3916 and mass of 17.37, and is already the best among the design history.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio for a truss loaded at node_3, with supports at nodes 1, 2, and 3, and all nodes already connected. Node positions for supports/loads are fixed. Current structure uses a near-minimal triangulated form.",
    
    "analysis": "The current structure is a quadrilateral (nodes 1-2-4-3) subdivided into triangles, efficiently distributing the load from node_3 to the supports. All members are in closed loops, ensuring stability. The load at node_3 (-15, -30) is significant, but the design history shows that reducing node_4's height (as in rank_2) increases both stress and mass. The current design (rank_1) uses node_4 at (4.0, 3.0), which is optimal for triangulation and load transfer. No constraint violations exist; max stress is well below the threshold, and total mass is low.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Lowering node_4 increases stress and mass. The current node_4 position yields the lowest stress-to-weight ratio in the history. All supports and loaded nodes are fixed, so only node_4 is adjustable, but moving it appears detrimental. No isolated or floating nodes. All members are necessary for triangulation.",
    
    "proposal": "Retain the current design as it is already optimal within the given constraints and design history. Further node_4 adjustment or member area changes would either increase stress or mass, degrading the objective. No redundant members to remove, and all are needed for closure and stability.",
    
    "reasoning": "The current structure uses efficient triangulation, with node_4 placed to minimize member lengths while maximizing vertical stiffness. All load paths are short and direct. The area selections for members are already minimal within the area set, given the stress levels. Any attempt to reduce areas further risks constraint violation. No further improvement is possible without violating constraints or increasing the objective.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume all supports and loaded nodes are fixed. Only node_4 could be moved, but history shows this increases the objective. All members are required for closure and stability. Mass is calculated as sum(length × area), with area_ids chosen to keep max(abs(stress)) below threshold. Stress-to-weight ratio = max(abs(stress))/total_mass = 6.8/17.37 = 0.3916. No change possible without constraint violation.",
    
    "calculation": "Member forces and stresses are already well below allowable; member_3 is the most stressed at -6.80. Areas are already at or near the minimum required for safety. Total mass is 17.37, well below the 30 limit. Stress-to-weight ratio is lowest in the history.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints are satisfied. The design is minimal and efficient. Further reduction in mass or stress is not possible without violating constraints or increasing the objective. Stopping optimization.",
    
    "stop": "True", # No further optimization possible; current design is already optimal within constraints and history.
