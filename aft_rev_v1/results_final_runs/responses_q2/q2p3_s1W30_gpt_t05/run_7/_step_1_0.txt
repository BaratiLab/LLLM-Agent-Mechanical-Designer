    "preamble": "The goal is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio of a closed 2D truss under given loads and support conditions. The current structure is constraint-satisfying (stress-to-weight ratio 0.5472, total mass 24.65), but further optimization is sought. The truss must remain closed, connected, and within mass and stress constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Current structure: 4 nodes (three on x-axis, one above), 6 members, all constraints satisfied. Objective: lower stress-to-weight ratio further. Key constraints: max(abs(stress))/total_weight <= 1.0, total mass <= 30. Node and member areas are currently moderate (mostly '2', one '4').",
    
    "analysis": "Supports: node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 (roller). Loads: node_3 (-15.0, -30.0) (down and left). Current node arrangement forms a triangle on the base (nodes 1-2-3) and a vertical node_4 above node_3. Members form a closed mesh, with node_4 bracing the base. Max stress is in member_3 (node_3-node_1), likely due to direct load transfer. The structure is stable and mass-efficient, but the high stress in member_3 suggests uneven load distribution.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Member_3 (node_3-node_1) is overloaded. The vertical offset of node_4 is moderate (2.8 above x-axis). The triangle base (nodes 1-2-3) is stretched (node_2 at x=6.0), possibly causing long, stressed members. Member areas are not fully optimized: some could be smaller, others larger for stress reduction. Potential: move node_4 higher or shift horizontally, or add a diagonal for better force distribution.",
    
    "proposal": "Optimize current structure by repositioning node_4 slightly higher and rightward to improve force distribution, reducing the stress in member_3. Adjust member areas: increase area of highly stressed member_3, reduce areas of lightly loaded members. Retain closed mesh and all constraints. Avoid adding new nodes, as current node count is minimal for closure and stability.",
    
    "reasoning": "Raising node_4 increases the height of the truss, improving vertical triangulation and reducing direct force in base members. Shifting node_4 rightwards (closer to node_2) better aligns with the load direction, distributing forces more evenly. Increasing the area of member_3 (highest stress) lowers its stress-to-weight ratio, while reducing area in lightly loaded members saves mass. These adjustments should reduce max(abs(stress))/total_weight while keeping mass within constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All supports and load nodes remain fixed. Only node_4 can be moved. Member_3 (node_3-node_1) carries max stress; increase its area from '2' to '3'. Members 4, 5, 6 (to node_4) are lightly loaded; reduce their area from '2'/'4' to '1'. Move node_4 from (2.0, 2.8) to (2.6, 3.4) to increase height and shift rightward. Lengths and member masses estimated using distance formula and area values. New configuration remains closed and satisfies all constraints.",
    
    "calculation": "Node_4 moved to (2.6, 3.4). New member lengths: member_4 (node_1-node_4) ≈ 4.34, member_5 (node_2-node_4) ≈ 3.96, member_6 (node_3-node_4) ≈ 3.48. Assign areas: member_1 ('2'), member_2 ('2'), member_3 ('3'), member_4 ('1'), member_5 ('1'), member_6 ('1'). Estimated member masses: member_1: 6.0*0.782=4.692, member_2: 4.0*0.782=3.128, member_3: 2.0*1.759=3.518, member_4: 4.34*0.195=0.847, member_5: 3.96*0.195=0.772, member_6: 3.48*0.195=0.679. Total mass ≈ 13.636 (<30). Max stress in member_3 reduced by area increase; stress-to-weight ratio expected to drop below 0.50. All constraints satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Design is improved: node_4 repositioned for better load path, member_3 area increased for stress reduction, other members slimmed for mass efficiency. Structure remains closed, all nodes connected, constraints met. No further nodes or members needed. Ready to output new design.",
