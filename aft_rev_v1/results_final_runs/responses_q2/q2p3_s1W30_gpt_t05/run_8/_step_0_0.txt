    "preamble": "This task involves designing a closed, fully connected 2D truss using three given nodes, specific support conditions, and a single applied load. The aim is to minimize the ratio of maximum member stress to total truss weight, while ensuring the structure is statically admissible and meets stress and mass constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three collinear nodes (all y=0), with loads and supports as described. The load on node_3 is not aligned with the axis of nodes, suggesting a need for out-of-line support. Triangulation via a new node is likely necessary to create a closed truss and resolve vertical load components efficiently.",
    
    "analysis": "With all nodes initially collinear, any truss assembled from these would be a mechanism (unstable in-plane). To resist the applied loads (especially the vertical component), a new node must be introduced above or below the line to form a triangle. The supports (pinned and two rollers) ensure determinacy. The optimal structure will likely be a single triangle connecting all nodes, with the new node located to minimize member forces and mass. The main failure mode is likely buckling or yielding in the most heavily loaded member (typically the one directly resisting the vertical load at node_3).",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation is essential. The new node should be placed to balance the moments and minimize force magnitudes in all members. Placing the node above the centroid of the base (nodes 1, 2, 3) will create two triangles and distribute the applied load. The area IDs must be chosen to keep mass low but ensure stress-to-weight is within limits.",
    
    "reasoning": "Add a fourth node above the base to create two triangles. This node should be positioned to achieve near-equal member lengths and minimize the lever arm for the vertical load, reducing peak internal forces. All three original nodes will connect to the new node, and all base nodes will be connected, forming a closed quadrilateral with a diagonal for triangulation. Area IDs will be selected to ensure the most loaded member has sufficient area to keep max(abs(stress))/total_weight <= 1.0, while other members use minimal area to reduce weight.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume all members are pin-jointed truss elements. Calculate member lengths using distance formula. Estimate internal forces using static equilibrium (joint method). Choose area IDs: assign higher area to the most loaded member (likely the one between node_3 and new node), minimal area to others. Calculate mass = sum(length_i * area_i). Calculate max(abs(stress)) = max(|force_i| / area_i). Compute stress-to-weight ratio and verify constraints.",
    
    "calculation": "Place new node_4 at (3.0, 2.5) for symmetry and efficient force resolution. Member lengths: node_1-node_4: sqrt((3-0)^2 + (2.5-0)^2) = 3.90; node_2-node_4: sqrt((6-3)^2 + (0-2.5)^2) = 3.90; node_3-node_4: sqrt((2-3)^2 + (0-2.5)^2) = 2.69. Base members: node_1-node_2: 6.0, node_2-node_3: 4.0, node_3-node_1: 2.0. Assign area_id '2' (0.782) to members with highest force (node_3-node_4), area_id '1' (0.195) to others. Estimate forces: vertical load at node_3 is shared between node_3-node_4 and base members. Assume max force in node_3-node_4: ~33.54 (from statics). Stress in node_3-node_4: 33.54/0.782=42.91. Total mass: (3.90+3.90+2.69)*0.782 + (6.0+4.0+2.0)*0.195 = (10.49*0.782)+(12.0*0.195)=8.20+2.34=10.54. Stress-to-weight: 42.91/10.54=4.07 (>1). Increase area_id for node_3-node_4 to '4' (3.128): stress=33.54/3.128=10.73; mass=(2.69*3.128)+(3.90+3.90)*0.782+(12.0*0.195)=8.41+6.10+2.34=16.85. Stress-to-weight=10.73/16.85=0.64 (<1). All constraints satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "The structure now forms a closed, triangulated truss with all nodes connected. The most loaded member has sufficient area to keep stress-to-weight within the limit. Total mass is well below 30. All members are referenced to unique nodes, and no duplicate connections exist. Node positions are precise to 1e-2. The design is efficient and constraint-satisfying.",
