Existing nodes form line only; no closed structure yet.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The initial nodes are colinear which doesn\'t form a triangle/closed truss. To create closed truss conditions and manage load path effectively, vertical or out-of-line new nodes to be added for triangulation. Load on node_3 is diagonal downward left; supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 and node_3 require structure to transmit forces efficiently. Purely horizontal members only carry axial tension/compression but stress must be limited. Out-of-plane node addition creates a minimal-height triangle to provide stiffness, reduce bending, and distribute forces effectively.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation is essential to create closure; simply connecting all three given nodes won\'t close since they are colinear. Adding one node above node_3 within the horizontal bounds of nodes 1 and 2 minimizes member lengths and thereby weight while enabling closed geometry. Must select minimal additional height to limit member lengths but sufficient to ensure zero flexural failure risk. Area selection shall vary by member axial load magnitude to minimize weight while satisfying stress constraint.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at approximately (2.0,1.5) creating triangles (node_1, node_4, node_3) and (node_3, node_4, node_2), closing truss.

The total six members include original connections to form closed shape:(node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_2, and new members around node_4. This minimizes eccentricities and load path moment arms.
