Objective is to minimize max(abs(stress))/total_weight further. Using history with better stress-to-weight ratios (best 0.2546) and given constraints to propose improved design.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given loads at node_3 and supports on node_1 (pinned), node_2, node_3 (rollers). Member areas {0..10} with specific sectional areas. Current truss closed between 4 nodes with full connectivity. Members mostly carry stresses within limits. Primary load path from node_3 downward load distributed through members to supports. Constraint mass limit 30 and max ratio 0.75 allow possible increase in member sizes or small geometry tweaks.",\n    "analysis": "Current node layout: nodes 1,2 fixed on x-axis (y=0.0), node_3 also on x-axis between node_1 and node_2 (2.0,0.0), node_4 raised at y=1.6. Load at node_3(-15,-30) creates tensile stress mainly in member_2 (1-3), compression in others. From generation history best solution reduced height node_4 to 1.5, used larger areas at member_1 and member_5 gave lower stress-to-weight ratio (~0.2546). Excessive member sizes at member_5 reduce stress but increase weight. Current member areas for low stress members (like member_4, member_6) are small quarter or half area. Member_2 carries major tension, should remain large to reduce stress. Height of node_4 affects triangle shape and force redistribution. Load path effective but efficiency improved by optimized member sizes and minor height adjustment. Current design balances weight and stress but can reduce node_4 height slightly and repurpose member areas to redistribute load better.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Pattern: Larger member areas (3) on chords side reduce region stress but increase weight. Member_5 area impacts stress ratio strongly. Minor height reduction of node_4 (from 1.6 to 1.5) improves stability and lowers stress ratio (per historic best). Member_2 consistently needs large area. Members connecting node_4 can be smaller to save weight but must maintain structural integrity. Use minimum necessary member area to meet stress constraints. Preserve node_3 fixed, so no x,y shift there. Push node_4 y down by 0.1m to 1.50m. Consider areas member_1=3, member_2=3, member_3=2, member_4=1, member_5=3, member_6=1 (historic best setting).",\n    "proposal": "Adopt structure from rank_1 historic design with node_4 lowered from 1.6m to 1.5m, members area optimized for minimal stress-to-weight ratio. Maintain fixed, roller and pinned supports as defined; node_3 stays fixed at y=0. Node adjustments minimized to maintain load and support integrity. Use member areas per rank_1, ensuring mass under 30 and ratio below 0.3, confirmed by historic results.",\n    "reasoning": "Lowering node_4 reduces member lengths (mass), improves force angle equilibrium, reduces max stress. Larger cross-sectional areas on main load path members (1,2,5) controls max stress, given axial tension/compression being dominant. Smaller areas in diagonal braces (4,6) reduce weight. Triangle geometry with base nodes at 0.0 level allows effective load transfer. Connection of node_4 redistributed load force vectors for more uniform stress distribution and lowered tension peaks. Approach consistent with minimizing total weight while keeping safety margin for allowable stress ratio.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths from node positions.
