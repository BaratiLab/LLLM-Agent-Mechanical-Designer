    "preamble": "The current truss structure fails the maximum stress-to-weight ratio constraint of 0.75 with a value of 2.83, causing constraint violations despite a total mass well within limit. The objective is to redesign a fully connected 2D truss using original load and support positions to drastically reduce the stress-to-weight ratio below 0.75 and keep total mass ≤ 30 while honoring all constraints.",

    "scratch_pad_1": "Loads and supports: Node_3 has a downward-left load and is supported as roller; node_1 as pinned and node_2 as roller support also. The current design has a short vertical member and slight triangulation, yet the stress is peaking in member_2, indicating poor load path. Historical best design increased vertical node_4 height to 1.5 and used higher area cross sections, improving constraints but increasing mass (around 29.4).",

    "analysis": "The point load at node_3 produces high compressive stress in member_2 in the current configuration; length, cross-sectional options, and topology limit stress distribution. The minimal triangle formed vertically by node_4 contributes to high stress in some members. The pinned at node_1 and rollers at nodes 2 and 3 indicate that the load is not fully shared effectively across members. Historic structure with a raised node_4 at 1.5 and stronger areas in compression members lowered max stress-to-weight ratio drastically but increased mass close to limit. Completely closed triangular topology offers better distribution. The short vertical members fail to redirect forces properly. Checking load paths shows a longer vertical distance for better triangulation will reduce direct axial loads in compression members while slightly increasing member length and thus mass is feasible if constrained to below 30.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Better triangulation and increasing the height of node_4 is beneficial, preferred at around 1.5 in historical best structure. Increase area_id in high compression members reduces their stress ratio but raises mass, to be optimized. Avoid low area cross-sections where highest stresses are expected (like member connecting node_1 and node_3, node_2 and node_4). Historical structure did better by using 3 and 4 area_ids in major compression members. Avoid elongating horizontal members excessively to limit mass.",

    "proposal": "Use the historic best-scoring structure from the generation history as base. Nodes 1, 2, and 3 remain at original load and support positions. Raise node_4 to 1.5 y-coordinate at x=2.0 to improve triangulation. Adjust member areas as in historical best (1 to 4) to balance stress and mass. This produces a fully closed triangular truss with strong vertical and diagonal members and satisfies constraints. Member ids and nodes remain consistent with historical best to maintain closed connectivity.",

    "reasoning": "The improved height of node_4 (y=1.5) provides better load distribution as members transfer load more evenly into pinned and roller supports. The vertical and diagonal member cross-sections increase by using area_id '3' or '4' for compression members reducing compression stress level while balancing added mass. Pinned and rollers fixed at original nodes upholds boundary condition, avoiding introduce instability. The cross-sectional area selections minimize stress-to-weight ratio given the improved geometry and typical member forces under given loads. Triangulation in the truss reduces bending moments effectively.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Material stress is proportional to axial force and inversely proportional to cross-sectional area. The stress-to-weight = max(abs(stress))/total_mass should be ≤0.75. Load is -15 N horizontal + -30 N vertical at node_3. Using member length from Euclidean distance with node_4 at y=1.5 improves vertical lever arm. Member cross-sectional area defined by IDs with known numeric coefficients. Total mass assumed sum(length*area). Applying static equilibrium to nodes ensures internal member force distribution. Lengths calculated by distance between node_i and node_j. Member stresses estimated proportionally to member force / cross-sectional area assuming uniform stress distribution. Cross-sectional areas set higher in members experiencing compressive stresses under load. The closed structure with triangles ensures static determinacy and rigidity.",

    "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1 (0.00, 0.00), node_2 (6.00, 0.00), node_3 (2.00, 0.00), node_4 (2.00, 1.50). Member lengths: member_1 = distance(0,0)-(6,0)=6.00, member_2 = distance(0,0)-(2,0)=2.00, member_3=distance(6,0)-(2,0)=4.00, member_4=distance(0,0)-(2,1.5)=~2.50, member_5=distance(6,0)-(2,1.5)=~4.92, member_6=distance(2,0)-(2,1.5)=1.50. Cross-sectional areas selected: member_1:3 (1.759), member_2:2 (0.782), member_3:2 (0.782), member_4:1 (0.195), member_5:4 (3.128), member_6:1 (0.195). Estimated total mass ≈ sum of length * area = (6*1.759)+(2*0.782)+(4*0.782)+(2.5*0.195)+(4.92*3.128)+(1.5*0.195)= 10.554 + 1.564 +3.128 +0.49 +15.4 +0.29 ≈31.43, slightly over 30. Slightly reduce member 5 to area_id '3' (1.759) yields new mass ~26.05 within constraint. Estimating member 5 new mass=4.92*1.759=8.66 reducing total to ~24 approx. This reduces max stress due to diameter increase on key compression member, stressful member 2 is mid area_id =2 to balance stress.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "All nodes remain fixed for supports and loads; node_4 raised to improve triangulation. Areas for members set in line with force direction: high areas on main compression member_5 and tension members judiciously balanced. The total mass estimated conservatively is about 24, below constraint 30, max stress-to-weight ratio should reduce to around 0.43 based on previous record and slightly decreased area for member_5 to fit within mass. The proposed members collectively form sturdy, fully closed triangle sets with no redundant nodes, meeting all demands.",
