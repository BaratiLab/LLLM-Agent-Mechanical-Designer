Objective is to generate a closed, stable 2D truss with node positions fixed at constrained nodes, load fully supported, and satisfy stress-to-weight ≤ 0.75 and total mass ≤ 30, minimizing weight while ensuring safety.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Load applied at node_3 (-15 N horizontal, -30 N vertical). Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 & node_3 (rollers). Current structure has 5 nodes, partly triangulated, with sparsely dimensioned members leading to high stresses (notably member_7 on (node_1-node_3)). Total mass 22.24 is below limit but stress-weight ratio is too high. Historic structures with fewer nodes have lower mass but do not close topology fully for rigidity.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 induces downward and leftward force, hence members near node_3 see high tension/compression. Member_7 severely stressed (-42.74 MPa equivalent), causing capacity violation. Current structure has longer members with larger areas but still not balanced load: load path from node_3 to supports spreads unevenly. History shows structures without node_5 and less members cope better in reducing max stress, likely due to improved triangulation. Also, extant members with area 1 and 0 are possibly undersized or mis-sized leading to stress concentration. Mass limit of 30 kg allows moderate to slightly heavy members if used efficiently.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Well-distributed triangulation and shorter members can reduce internal forces. Critical to fix nodes with load and support. Removing node_5 and adjusting node_4’s y-position can help rebalance forces. Favor three-node triangles like (1,3,4) and (2,3,4) over longer diagonals to spread forces. Use moderate section areas for key members near the applied load/supports to keep stresses below yield while limiting weight. Also, fully close the structure making all nodes connected at least twice except rollers, to avoid mechanism modes.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Remove node_5 to simplify geometry and remove unnecessary mass. Set nodes as node_1 at (0,0), node_2 at (6,0), node_3 at (2,0), and node_4 repositioned slightly higher (y~2.7) for better triangulation between node_2, node_3, node_4 and node_1. Connect members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_4-node_2, and node_1-node_2 to complete closed truss. Use moderate to large area members on critical compression and tension paths, specifically area \'2\', \'3\' or \'4\' depending on estimated member lengths and load sharing.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "The truss geometry is a quadrilateral base with a higher node_4 to form triangle elements distributing vertical and lateral loads. This reduces excessively long member stresses like node_1 to node_2 directly. Members crossing from supports directly to loaded nodes create direct load paths with acceptable stress intensity. Member sizes selected from \'0.782\' (area_id=\'2\') up to \'3.128\' (area_id=\'4\') balance stress and mass. Symmetry about vertical axis offers load balance and stiffness. Fixed supports constrain both vertical and horizontal displacements or at least one direction, allowing load transfer to ground effectively. Roller on node_3 allows horizontal slide but support load vertical forces.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume linear elastic behavior, stress proportional to force and cross-sectional area. Member length = euclidean distance; mass = length × area density. Force balance roughly done by summing horizontal and vertical components at nodes. Take nominal allowable stress = 30 MPa.
