The goal is to redesign the structure to meet all constraints by improving load distribution, reducing high stress, and maintaining structural continuity.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Current design has a linear base with elevated node_4 forming a triangle. Load at node_3 is heavy and downward-left. Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 and node_3 (rollers). Some members have high stress and mass (member_1 notably critical). Optimization target: reduce max stress to below 0.75×total mass and keep mass under 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load is concentrated on node_3 downward-left, transmitted to node_1 (pinned) and supports at node_2 and node_3 itself. Members along the base (member_6) carry compressive forces but have large mass; members from node_4 distribute load vertically upwards and diagonally. Member_1 experiences high compressive stress (-13.44) indicating instability or excessive load in one element. History shows prior designs with higher masses and stress ratios (e.g., 1.66). The structure is closed but stress-to-weight ratio and mass balance are currently unsatisfactory.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "The heavy load at node_3 suggests need for better triangulation and balanced load path avoiding overloading single tension/compression members. Node_3 has roller support but carries large vertical load; adding a vertical support or elevating node_4 or repositioning members for load sharing could mitigate stress peaks. Reducing cross-sectional area for low-stress members and reinforcing high-stress members with larger area might be balanced to lower ratio.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Redesign the truss to a more symmetric triangular/planar geometry retaining nodes with load and supports fixed (node_1,2,3). Introduce an additional node above midpoint between node_1 and node_2 for better triangulation, and connect members to form overlapping triangles ensuring load path redundance and stiffness. Choose area_ids balancing mass and stress to reduce maximum stress-to-weight ratio below 0.75 while keeping total mass below 30. Keep node_4 elevation strategically to optimize load transfer.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Introducing an apex node (node_5) vertically above ground nodes forms a two-triangle system distributing load and reducing peak forces. Symmetry reduces differential load, reduces bending moments. Using smaller cross-sectional areas for base members and larger areas only for critical diagonals balances mass and stiffness. Node positions precisely tuned redistribute vertical-load effects. Supports remain to avoid overconstraint. This approach is common in efficient truss design under one heavy concentrated load close to supports.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: base (6.0 m) nodes fixed, vertical height ~3.3 m (node_5 at center x=3.0) chosen to improve force angle. Members connectivity: node_1-node_5, node_2-node_5, node_3-node_5, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_2. Assign area_ids: 1 (0.195) for lighter tension links, and 2 (0.782) for primary compression diagonals. Compute force vectors by statics: sum forces, moments to find force magnitude in members. Then stress = force/(area), mass = length*area_density.
