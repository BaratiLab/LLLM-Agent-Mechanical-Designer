The truss must be closed and fully connected, minimizing max(|stress|)/mass <=0.75, and total mass <=30. Area sets range from 0.195 to 19.548. Initial simple triangle with direct members (1-2, 2-3, 1-3) is unstable due to roller supports on nodes 2 and 3 both horizontally free, so one node addition is likely needed for triangulation and load paths.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Supports: node_1 pinned restrains vertical and horizontal; nodes 2 and 3 roller allow vertical reactions only. The external load at node_3 is (-15, -30) N. Redundantly triangulated frame needed to transfer horizontal load since nodes 2 and 3 have no horizontal reaction supports. Members connect nodes to stabilize in horizontal direction and carry vertical loads through triangulation. A 4th node between nodes 2 and 3 but above baseline can form stable triangles. Key failure modes: horizontal displacement at nodes 2 and 3; overstressing single members due to eccentric load path. Efficient closed truss has triangulated bays minimizing length and weight, uses high area only in highly stressed members.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Vertical members aligned at load location preferred; any horizontal member to transmit horizontal reactions left-to-right. The baseline is detaching under horizontal load; adding node_4 (on say x=4, y=3) forming 2 triangular panels yields stably triangulated layout distributing loads. Members 1-3, 1-4, 3-4, 4-2, and 2-3 yield closed polygon; gives clear force paths minimizing max stress with moderate area groups usage. Mass constraint limiting very large areas across many members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Add node_4=(4.0,3.0) to create closed quadrilateral with two triangles (1-3-4) and (4-2-3). Prioritize small to moderate area sections for long diagonal members and higher area for short, highly loaded ones. Cross-section area IDs assigned: longest member with medium-small area to save weight. Load resolved from node_3 diagonal to node_4 then supports. Use static equilibrium to size areas so max stress <= total weight × 0.75, keeping total mass under 30 based on length-area product. Triangles ensure rigidity and stable loads transfer horizontally and vertically.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Materials linear elastic, stress proportional to force/cross section; uniform unit density.
