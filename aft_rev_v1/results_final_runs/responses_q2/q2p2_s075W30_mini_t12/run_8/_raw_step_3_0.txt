Current design is feasible with stress-to-weight ratio 0.5934; aim to minimize it further while maintaining constraints.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given load at node_3 is downward-left; supports fix x,y at node_1 and vertical at node_2, node_3. Current structure has 4 nodes forming a closed chain via 6 members with mixed cross-section areas. Total mass 25.43 <=30; max stress_to_weight is 0.5934 <=0.75, so constraints met.",\n\n  "analysis": "Load causes compression on member_4 (node_1 to node_3) with max stress absolute 15.09. Members connecting node_4 handle tension/compression balancing vertical support reactions. Current area choices reflect high area in compressive member_1,2 (area=3) and smaller for others. History shows alternatives violate constraints or have higher stress/weight. Node_4 placed at (3.0,4.0) provides adequate triangulation reducing stress but member_4\'s area could be increased slightly to reduce max stress. Member mass skewed with heavy top chords and lighter bottom chords - imbalance may be refined to redistribute stresses more uniformly.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns indicate member_4 is critical with peak stress. Lower area for member_3,5 acceptable given low stresses. Increasing area for member_4 reduces stress but adds mass, tradeoff small as mass relative to limit. Slight reposition of node_4 vertically (reduce from 4.0 to around 3.6) can reduce member_4 length thus reducing stress. Maintaining closed quadrilateral and all constraints. Using area \'4\' (3.128) for member_4 up from \'2\'(0.782) can reduce stress. Other members remain mostly same. Avoid excessive mass increase.",\n\n  "proposal": "Improve current design by minor node_4 vertical downward adjustment, increase member_4 area from \'2\' to \'4\' to reduce critical max stress, slightly reduce area on member_3 from \'1\' to \'0\' for small mass saving. Keep remaining layout topologically same to guarantee closed frame, supports fixed as required. This should produce a better stress-to-weight ratio < 0.55 and meet all constraints.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 down reduces length of critical compressive member_4 and reduces induced stress given load orientation. Increasing member_4 cross section area reduced stress. Reducing minor tension member area (member_3) leverages lower force demand to conserve mass. Symmetric member areas 1 and 2 are acceptable to maintain load path and stability.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate new member lengths: node_1 (0.0,0.0) to node_4(3.00,3.60) length~4.806 m; node_1 to node_3 length fixed at 2; Calculate masses using length × assigned areas; Sum masses check ≤30; Calculate stresses for member_4, new area increases cross-sectional area, expect stress reduction approx as stress ~ force/area; Estimate max stress for member_4 ~ 15.1*(0.782/3.128)=~3.77 <15.09; Check total mass new = heavy members plus smaller member_3 area; estimate new total mass ~25.5 <30 within budget.",\n\n  "calculation": "Member lengths: m4: 4.81m, m3: length: ~4.12m (node_3 to node_4), m1:m2 ~5.0m.
