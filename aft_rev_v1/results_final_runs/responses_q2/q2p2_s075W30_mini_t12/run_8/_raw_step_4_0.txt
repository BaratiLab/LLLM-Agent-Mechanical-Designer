The objective is to generate a closed 2D truss structure minimizing the stress-to-weight ratio below 0.75 and total mass below 30 with all nodes connected.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Loads: downward and leftward force at node_3. Supports on node_1 (pinned) and roller on node_2 and node_3. Nodes located along base line at y=0 and a single top node at node_4. Current members form somewhat asymmetric connections with varied cross-sectional areas. Constraints are violated mainly due to exceeding mass, likely from large cross sections or overbuilt members and imbalance causing high stresses.",\n  "analysis": "Load path requires strong members around node_3 transmitting load to supports at node_1 and node_2. Current design has heavy cross sections at some members causing excess weight (e.g., member_4 has high stress and mass). The structure is somewhat stable but the vertical node position (node_4 at y=3.6) is lower than in history which ranges up to 4. The generation history shows highest-scoring feasible structure places node_4 at y=4 with balanced cross sections and members in triangulated arrangements. Removing inefficient members reduced mass but some load paths didn\'t satisfy stresses. The members crossing midpoints (node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3) carry large loads and high stresses today. Symmetry and triangulation can improve stress distribution and reduce stress peaks.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "High stresses localize on member_4 (node_1-node_3) indicating it might be carrying too much load. The node_4 vertical position affects stress distribution and mass; higher position (y=4.0) improved balance historically. Using area_ids mostly in moderate range reduces mass but must keep enough stiffness. Member_3 area should be at least minimal to not drop performance. Total mass must be reduced to below 30, so we need lighter cross-sectional areas and possibly reposition node_4 to higher position to reduce member lengths and forces.",\n  "proposal": "Reuse historical best topology with node_4 repositioned exactly at (3.0, 4.0). Use moderate area_ids from \'0\' to \'3\' carefully allocating smaller cross-sections on low-stress members and larger on high-stress members. Keep all six members for closed triangulated layout, retaining connectivity of all nodes with good load paths. This design balances mass and stress-to-weight ratio and meets constraints based on history data and structural reasoning.",\n  "reasoning": "1) Keep node_1 and node_2 horizontal supports at (0,0) and (6,0) as in load setup. 2) Keep node_3 fixed at (2,0) as it is a load and roller support node. 3) Place node_4 at (3.0,4.0) to form symmetric upper node near midpoint between node_1 and node_2 horizontally, raising vertical coordinate maximizes geometric stiffness reducing member forces in vertical members. 4) Triangular members around node_4 - connect node_1, node_2, node_3 to node_4, enclosing a triangulated system. 5) Use area id \'3\' for diagonal members node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4 for strength, \'1\' for node_3-node_4 low stress member, \'2\' for base edge node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, and the horizontal base node_1-node_2 to balance mass-stiffness tradeoff. This maintains low stress and low mass with all members active and effective load transfer. Stress-to-weight ratio expect below 0.75, total mass below 30 from prior benchmarking.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate approximate member lengths: \\nnode_1-node_4: sqrt((3-0)^2+(4-0)^2)=5.00\\nnode_2-node_4: sqrt((6-3)^2+(0-4)^2)=5.00\\nnode_3-node_4: sqrt((3-2)^2+(4-0)^2)=4.12\\nnode_1-node_3: 2.00\\nnode_2-node_3: 4.00\\nnode_1-node_2: 6.00\\nMass estimations = sum(length * cross sectional area).
