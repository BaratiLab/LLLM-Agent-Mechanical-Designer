Objective is to redesign a fully triangulated, stable 2D truss with supports and loads fixed on nodes 1,2,3 to reduce max stress/weight under 0.75 and mass ≤30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 of (-15,-30) induces significant tensile/compressive forces. Supports at nodes 1 (pinned), 2 and 3 (rollers) fix all DOFs appropriately. Current structure has a weak side member (member_4) with very high stress, indicating uneven load paths and inefficient force transfer.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure forms a partial trapezoid with a top node_4. Members between node_1/node_2 to node_4 are relatively large cross sections, but the compressive stress is concentrated on member_4 (node_1-node_3). The roller at node_3 limits vertical reaction, concentrating load transfer challenges there. Structure lacks full triangulation and symmetry; this results in high stress on certain members and suboptimal weight usage. Historic designs also show stresses above limits or higher mass. Member cross sections appear poorly matched to load paths, allowing oversize or over-stressed members. The mass is under limit but stress ratio too high because of poor force flow in loaded bottom chord.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Important to rearrange nodes to enforce symmetry and add triangulation connecting node_3 more fully to nodes 1 and 2. Max stress from member_4 is the main violation. Minimizing peak stress-to-weight under 0.75 means improving low-stress load sharing by adding more effective members and balancing cross section sizes. Node_4 can be adjusted upwards or sideways to optimize angles and force transmission.
