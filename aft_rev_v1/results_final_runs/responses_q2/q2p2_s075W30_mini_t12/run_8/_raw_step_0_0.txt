Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 and node_3 rollers. Initial structure is just a single line—unstable and no closed shape. Need triangulation and closed geometry.",\n\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 is downward-left diagonal. Node_1 pinned restrains horizontal/vertical; node_2 roller supports vertical only. Single segment (node_1 to node_2) is insufficient structurally and no closed shape. Introducing node_4 above nodes to form triangle provides stable truss. Member layout ensures force resolution with triangulation, preventing excessive bending or large tension/compression in single members and minimizing total weight.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangular closed truss ideal here - least members for closed form (3 or more). Member forces balanced by symmetric or near symmetric triangle. Adding node_4 atop, left shifted from node_3 to improve load path directness. Consider area selection minimally to reduce weight but enough to carry stressheets from load of -15 N at 30° angle.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Add a new node_4 = (3.0, 3.5) above node_3 shifts above line for proper triangulation. Members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4 and node_1-node_3 and node_2-node_3 to form a closed polygon with inward bracing. Use smaller areas (area_id = \'2\' -> 0.782, \'1\'-> 0.195) on small or less stressed members and larger area_id families (3 or 4) on primary load path members to keep stresses low and maintain mass under 30. Firmly connect all nodes for structure rigidity and compliance.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths with distance formula. Assume axial load only. Use tensile/compressive force equilibrium in nodes. Given load vector components fx = -15cos30° = -12.99N, fy = -15sin30° = -7.5N. Compute internal member forces from static equilibrium (sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0). Weight = sum(length*area). Stress is proportional to force/area; keep max(|stress|)/weight ratio ≤ 0.75.

Total estimated mass approx: 4.30*1.759*2 + 3.64*0.782 + 4*0.782 + 2*0.195 = 24.6 (<30). Calculate member forces solving static equilibrium gives max internal force magnitude ~14.5 N.
