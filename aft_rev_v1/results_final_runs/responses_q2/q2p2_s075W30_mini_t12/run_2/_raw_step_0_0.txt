The goal is a low stress-to-weight ratio <= 0.75 with total mass <= 30 using allowed member areas.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0) form a colinear line. Load is -15 N at node_3 downward and left-angled (-30 deg). Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller, node_3 roller. Constraint must ensure closed truss, i.e., a triangle, since three colinear points are unstable, so a new node needed off the line.",\n\n  "analysis": "A 3-node truss on a straight line is unstable under load and can\'t resist moments or lateral forces; thus introducing a fourth node off the baseline to create a closed, triangulated structure greatly improves stability and load transfer. Load at node_3 has horizontal and vertical components, requiring lateral and vertical load-resisting elements. Supports pin at node_1 (horizontal+vertical fixed) and roller at node_2 and node_3 (vertical only, allowing horizontal movement) imply node_1 carries significant reaction. Total mass must be under 30. Using triangulation will reduce peak stresses by distributing forces along members all effective in tension or compression. Choose area IDs balancing stiffness and weight.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Key is adding a node above node_3 to form a triangular loop with node_1 and node_2. Because node_3 lies between node_1 and node_2, an apex at about x=2.0 horizontally above node_3 with some y>0 forms a triangle. Members connecting node_1-node_apex, node_2-node_apex, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2 and node_3-node_apex make up a closed triangulated truss network. Area IDs can be reduced on baseline members in compression or tension, and larger for diagonal members under high stress.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Choose apex node at (2.0, 3.0) - high enough to open triangle and not too large to increase member lengths excessively. We keep original three nodes fixed per instruction, add one new node \'node_4\'. Form members: (node_1,node_3), (node_3,node_2), (node_1,node_4), (node_2,node_4), (node_3,node_4) all using chosen cross-sectional areas. Triangulated structure ensures closed loop and stiffness to handle mixed loading. Members near load node have higher areas to reduce stress; baseline members smaller area reduce weight. Verify mass and stress-to-weight ratio with force analysis assuming axial forces for members. Assume uniform axial stress distributed under static equilibrium.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic, axial members only. Static equilibrium of forces for nodes. The load at node_3 must be resolved by internal member forces. Reaction at node_1 (pinned) resists both vertical and horizontal; node_2 and node_3 rollers resist vertical only.
