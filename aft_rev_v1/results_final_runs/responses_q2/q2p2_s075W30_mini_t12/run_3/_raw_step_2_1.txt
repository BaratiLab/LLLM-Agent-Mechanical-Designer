The objective is to provide a fully connected, closed truss minimizing stress-to-weight while satisfying constraints.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "The load at node_3 (-15N x, -30N y) induces significant compression in member_1 (node_1-node_3) exceeding limits. Current members have uniform area_id \'2\' (area=0.782), which may be inadequate. Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 and node_3 (rollers) provide partial restraint. The current structure is a basic loaded triangle with one diagonal (node_3-node_4).",\n\n  "analysis": "The load is mainly vertical down at node_3, so primary compressive stress developed in member_1 due to load transfer to support at node_1. Members node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4 are additional diagonals to form a triangular truss. History shows structure rank_1 increased member areas (3) for nodes connecting at node_4 improved stress ratio but increased mass to 25.56. The current configuration is light but overstressed in member_1. There is no node repositioning of loaded/support nodes allowed; node_4 nearby can be moved. The structure is small with all three nodes essentially colinear (node_1, node_2, node_3 along y=0). Node_4 forms a triangle at roughly (3.2,3.5).",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Hence, improvement stems from: (1) Increasing cross-sectional area selectively on critical tension/compression members to reduce stress-to-weight, (2) Slight repositioning of node_4 to improve force distribution and increase triangulation effectiveness, (3) possibly adding additional members to redistribute forces if feasible, (4) ensuring closed truss without isolated nodes. However, mass limit 30 suggests room to increase some member sizes to reduce stress ratio well below 0.75.",\n\n  "proposal": "Reuse proximity of node locations, keeping fixed nodes supported and loaded unchanged. Increase node_4 height slightly and shift horizontally to optimize triangulation, allowing decreased stress in critical members. Increase cross-sectional area from \'2\' (0.782) to \'3\' (1.759) for member_1 (critical compression) and members connected to node_4 for better distribution. Structure kept fully connected with 5 members linking nodes as in historical rank_1 but optimized positions.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Increasing cross-section from 0.782 to 1.759 doubles capacity on primary stress members, cuts max stress-to-weight ratio roughly by half. Moving node_4 closer above node_3 (approx y=3.0, x=3.5) creates more effective load path via diagonals, reducing bending and local stresses. Maintaining pinned and roller supports prevents unnecessary node movement. The structure remains closed with all members interconnected. Areas selected from provided set to honor constraints and optimize mass.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic truss, stresses proportional to internal forces per cross-section area. Smaller max stress-to-weight ratio and next to zero bending expected from increased cross sectional areas on main compressive members. Lift node_4 from y=3.5 to y=3.0 reduces out of plane instability, slightly increasing horizontal distance between supports and loaded node. Calculate approximate member lengths for mass: members 1 & 2 (length ~ 2.0, 4.0 units), members connecting node_4 (approx length ~3.0-4.0). Mass per member = length * area. Ensure total_mass <30.
