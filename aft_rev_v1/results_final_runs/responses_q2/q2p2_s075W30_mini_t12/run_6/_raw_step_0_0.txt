Objective: minimize max stress-to-weight ratio, ensuring a closed truss configuration that meets structural constraints on stress and mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes form a partially linear set; loads act at node_3 with negative X and downward Y components. Supports are pinned at node_1, roller at node_2 and node_3. Truss must be closed, i.e., nodes fully connected. Constraints require stress-to-weight ratio <= 0.75, total mass <= 30. Area IDs and their cross-sections range from 0.195 to 19.548. Initial step: check what closed topology and member areas satisfy constraints given the load direction and supporter conditions.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-15N, -30N) generates combined horizontal and vertical forces. Node 1 is pinned (resists horizontal and vertical), node 2 is roller (only vertical reaction), node 3 roller (presumably vertical reaction). With node_3 load down-left, forces induce axial tension/compression in members connected to node_3. Use triangulation to avoid mechanisms: connect nodes (1-3), (2-3), and add node_4 strategically to close truss triangularly and distribute moment and load paths evenly. Node_4 at approx (4.0, 4.0) to form top chord helps transfer vertical loads reducing stress concentration in long members. Evaluate stresses using trigonometric member forces, pick smaller area_id values where possible to reduce weight while respecting max stress.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The three original nodes alone tend to produce higher stress ratios due to poor load paths (only one triangle 1-2-3 along baseline). Introducing node_4 above below height intensifies triangulation and forms a better closed shape. Lower height of node_4 (4.0) balances height-to-span, reducing lever arms and large tension/compression. Member (1-4), (2-4), (3-4) angles reduce bending and isolate axial loads eliminating failure modes. Choice of moderate area_id for compressed members and smaller for tension will optimize weight.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Structurally, to minimize stress-to-weight ratio: we introduce a node above the line to form two triangular areas, distributing axial load better. Use shortest possible members consistent with closed loops, and minimum or moderate areas chosen based on axial force directions and calculated stresses. Symmetry or near balanced member lengths minimizes axial force peaks. Node_4 at (4.00, 4.00) positioned for balanced, stable triangulation. Members chosen among (1-2), (1-3), (2-3), (1-4), (2-4), (3-4) to ensure connectivity and distributed load paths; select areas from ID: 1 (0.195) to 5 (4.887) to optimize stiffness to weight tradeoff without exceeding constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Load acts as point load at node_3, members only carry axial forces. Equilibrium equations at nodes 1,2,3,4 resolved in x and y directions. Calculate member lengths for mass = sum(length×cross_section_area). Cross_section_area from area_id map. Calculate member forces by resolving nodal forces and using trigonometry. Approximate stresses proportional to axial force and inversely proportional to cross section (area).
