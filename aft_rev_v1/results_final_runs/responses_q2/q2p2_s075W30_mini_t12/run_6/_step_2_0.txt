    "preamble": "The current truss design violates the stress-to-weight constraint with a ratio of 1.1249, exceeding the limit of 0.75. The total mass (13.166) is within allowable limits. The objective is to produce a fully connected 2D truss structure fixing these violations while maintaining the given load and support constraints without relocating loaded or supported nodes.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given one downward load (-30N) at node_3 and supported pinned at node_1 and rollers at node_2 and node_3, the main stress concentration is on members near node_3. Current max stress in member_2 (-14.81) is high compared to other members. Constraints demand the max stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 0.75 and total mass ≤ 30.",
    
    "analysis": "The current truss has node_4 as a top node at (3.42,3.22) forming triangles with ground nodes. Members with high stress are those connected directly to node_3 and node_4, especially member_2 between node_1 and node_3. The loading direction introduces tension in some members and compression in others (noted negative stresses). Historic best design moved node_4 higher and more right (to (4,4) approx), increasing total mass but lowering stress ratio (to 0.5679). However, mass (24.83) was almost maximal and it used area 3 and 2 members for stronger cross bracing. Current design uses mostly area 2, possibly insufficient for load. Failed models used lighter members but suffered high stress. To reduce stress/weight ratio, a better triangulated structure with efficient member sizing and positioning is required. The node positions must remain for loads/supports, but additional nodes or repositioning node_4 upwards-right help better distribute forces in a stable triangular configuration.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns suggest that increasing the height and horizontal offset of node_4 reduces the high stress in diagonal members. Using selective higher area_id sections only on smaller critical diagonals and lighter areas for other members balances mass. Excessively large areas increase mass, hurting ratio. Appropriate triangulation eliminates bending effects and supports pure axial loads, helping reduce stress levels. The current triangular faces around node_4 provide a lever arm balancing the vertical down force but require stiffer members from node_3 to node_4 and from node_1 to node_4.",
    
    "proposal": "Use historic node_4 location at (4.00,4.00) to improve load distribution. Keep nodes 1,2,3 fixed due to supports and loads. Use a member connectivity similar to historic best design providing a closed triangle (node_1-node_4-node_3 and node_2-node_4) plus all base members among nodes 1,2,3. Assign selective member areas: base members lighter (~1), diagonals with moderate/large areas (2 or 3) for stress limits. This improves stress-to-weight below 0.75 and mass less than 30 with stable triangulated closed layout.",
    
    "reasoning": "Maintaining geometric symmetry around load bearing nodes handles load concentrations effectively. Elevating node_4 to (4.00,4.00) increases vertical height and moment arm, reducing forces in critical diagonals. Using area_id '3' (1.759) or '2' (0.782) in diagonals balances mass and capacity well; all base members use small or minimal area (area_id '1'=0.195) to reduce mass. This gives efficient load paths through tension & compression members. Member connectivity forms 2 overlapping triangles, maximizing rigidity. Using members 1,2,3 base and members 4,5,6 diagonals, each constrained in tensile/compressive stress capacity ensures constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Stress proportional to axial force/area; areas discrete as per given keys; lengths from node distance. Mass = sum over members (length × area density). Stress capacity balanced so max(abs(stress)) ≤ 14.1MPa (safe margin). Using trigonometric node distances: node_1: (0,0), node_2: (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (4,4). Member lengths computed by Euclidean distance calculation. Assign areas to achieve stress/weight ≤ 0.75 computed by max_stress / total_mass. Check # members = 6 with no isolated nodes.",
    
    "calculation": "Member lengths: m1(node_1-node_2): 6.00m, m2(node_1-node_3): 2.00m, m3(node_2-node_3):4.00m, m4(node_1-node_4): 5.6569m, m5(node_2-node_4): 4.4721m, m6(node_3-node_4):4.4721m. Areas set: m1=1 (0.195 cyc as base), m2=2 (0.782), m3=1(0.195), m4=3(1.759), m5=2(0.782), m6=3(1.759) chosen to resist max stresses explicitly. Mass approx = sum(length×area_density) = 6×0.195 + 2×0.782 + 4×0.195 + 5.6569×1.759 +4.4721×0.782 +4.4721×1.759 = 1.17 +1.564 +0.78 +9.95 +3.5 +7.86 = 24.82 approx < 30. Max stress approx 14MPa from analysis. Stress-to-weight ratio = 14 /24.82 ≈ 0.56 < 0.75 passed.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "All supports and loads fixed (no moves). Node_4 moved upward & right. Members connect all nodes forming overlapping triangles. Areas set to balance mass and stresses. Predicted stress-weight ratio satisfies constraint at 0.56. Total mass below 30 at ~24.82. Structure fully connected. Constraints fully satisfied. Ready for output generation.",
