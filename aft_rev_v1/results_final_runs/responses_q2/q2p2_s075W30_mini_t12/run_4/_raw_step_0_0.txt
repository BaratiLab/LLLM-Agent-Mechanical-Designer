Design objective is to minimize max(abs(stress))/total_weight while maintaining closure and load equilibrium under constraints.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "We have three nodes initially colinear on x-axis. Load at node_3 is downward-left, eliciting vertical and horizontal reactions. The structure must be closed and all nodes connected. Current layout is untriangulated and unstable for out-of-plane loading; adding new nodes and members likely improves stability and efficiency.",\n\n    "analysis": "The load of magnitude 15 at ~-30° acts mostly downward at node_3. Boundary conditions: node_1 pinned (fixes both directions), node_2 roller (horizontal freedom). The initial linear nodes cause poor stability and higher bending moments. A typical triangulated design placing an additional node above ensures truss stability and reduces member stresses. Members need to channel load primarily through tension/compression, avoiding bending. Minimal mass from choosing smaller area_ids but must respect strength needs; choosing several mid-range areas balances mass and stress.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "To close and stabilize structure, add a node above node_3 forming triangles with nodes 1 and 2. This node must allow load paths splitting forces into compressive and tensile members. Actions: create a new node_4 above node_3 forming two triangles: node_1-node_4-node_3 and node_2-node_4-node_3, ensuring full connectivity, stability, and resolving vertical load efficiently.",\n\n    "reasoning": "The additional node_4 placed around (4.0, 3.23) creates a two-triangle structure: left triangle node_1-node_3-node_4 and right triangle node_2-node_3-node_4, symmetrizing load paths and improving force distribution. Connect node_4 to nodes 1, 2, and 3. The internal triangulation splits forces, lowering maximum member stresses. Area choices between 2 and 6 optimize strength and weight balance, respecting constraint mass ≤30. Use lower indexes for lightly loaded members to minimize weight. The connection between node_1-node_2 (base) is maintained for closure.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: uniform material density; stresses proportional to axial forces divided by member area; mass proportional to length × area (unit density). Calculate member lengths using 2D distance formula, assign areas from area_id mapping. Equilibrium equations in x and y at each node and overall system solve for member forces.
