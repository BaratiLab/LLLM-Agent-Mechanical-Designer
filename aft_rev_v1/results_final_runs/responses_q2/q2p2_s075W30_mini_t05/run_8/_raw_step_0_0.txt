The objective is to optimize member layout and cross-sectional areas to meet stress-to-weight ratio <=0.75 and mass <=30 constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes: node_1(0,0, pinned), node_2(6,0, roller), node_3(2,0, roller) with load (-15, -30) at node_3. Only 3 nodes initially, colinear on x-axis. To form a closed truss, additional nodes needed off the line for triangulation and load path efficiency. Areas must be chosen from given discrete values. Constraints on stress-to-weight ratio and total mass must be met.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The three original nodes lie on a line, so no inherent triangulation exists, risking unstable or inefficient structure. The load at node_3 is downward-left, requiring strong support transfer to pinned node_1 and roller node_2. A closed truss requires at least one new node off the line to form triangles. Triangulation reduces bending and distributes forces efficiently. Members must be chosen to resist tension/compression with minimal mass. Larger areas increase mass but reduce stress. The load vector magnitude is about 33.54 units. Structural members must be sized to keep max stress low while keeping total mass under 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding one node above the line near node_3 creates two triangles (node_1, node_3, new_node) and (node_3, node_2, new_node). This forms a closed truss with 4 nodes and 5 members. Member choices must balance length, area, and force. The new node should be placed to minimize member lengths and maximize triangulation efficiency. The load path from node_3 to supports can be split through the new node, reducing stress. Areas for short compression/tension members can be smaller, longer members need larger areas.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Place new node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) above node_3 to form two triangles with minimal member lengths. Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_2-node_1, and node_4-node_2 to close the truss. This yields a closed polygon with triangulation. Assign areas based on member lengths and expected forces: largest area for longest member under tension/compression, smaller areas for shorter members. Use area_id \'4\' (3.128) for key tension members, \'1\' (0.195) for short compression members, and \'2\' (0.782) for intermediate.
