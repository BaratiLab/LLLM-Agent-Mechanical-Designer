Objective is to minimize stress-to-weight ratio while keeping total mass ≤ 30 and max stress/weight ≤ 0.75. The truss must be fully connected and stable.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes: node_1 (0,0, pinned), node_2 (6,0, roller), node_3 (2,0, roller) with a load at node_3 of magnitude 15 at -30°. The initial structure is a line of nodes, no closed truss. Need to add nodes and members to form a stable, triangulated, closed structure with optimized member areas from provided discrete area set.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Supports: node_1 pinned restrains vertical and horizontal, node_2 and node_3 rollers restrain vertical only. Load at node_3 has horizontal and vertical components (~Fx = -12.99, Fy = -7.5). The current line configuration is unstable under lateral load. A triangular or polygonal closed truss with nodes above the baseline can distribute load efficiently. Triangulation is essential to avoid mechanism failure. The load path should transfer from node_3 to supports node_1 and node_2 via tension/compression in members. Member lengths and areas must be balanced to minimize weight and stress.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a top node above node_3 creates a triangle with nodes (node_1, node_2, new_node_top). This provides a direct load path. Additional diagonal members from node_3 to new top node will triangulate the structure. The new node should be placed to balance forces and minimize member lengths. Using the largest area for longest, most stressed members and smaller areas for shorter members can optimize weight. The baseline nodes are fixed; new node coordinates must be precise.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Introduce one new node (node_4) above node_3 at (2.0, 3.0) to form a triangle with node_1 and node_2. Members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, plus baseline members node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2. This creates a closed polygon with triangulation. The top node placement at 3 units height balances vertical load and reduces horizontal member lengths. Assign area_ids by member length and expected force: largest area to longest members and those carrying compression/tension from load. Use trigonometry and static equilibrium to estimate member forces and stresses. Calculate total weight from member lengths and assigned areas. Adjust areas to meet constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic members, axial forces only, uniform density, unit thickness. Calculate member lengths using distance formula. Calculate forces by resolving load at node_3 into components and applying equilibrium at nodes. Use sum of forces in x and y directions at nodes to solve member forces. Calculate stress = force / area. Weight = sum(length_i × area_i). Stress-to-weight ratio = max(abs(stress)) / total_weight. Area IDs from given set. Iterate area assignment to minimize stress-to-weight ratio while respecting max stress and total mass constraints.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths (approx): node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_2 = 4.0, node_1-node_4 = sqrt((2-0)^2 + (3-0)^2) = 3.606, node_2-node_4 = sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-3)^2) = 5.0, node_3-node_4 = 3.0. Assign areas: node_2-node_4 (longest) area_id \'5\' (4.887), node_1-node_4 area_id \'4\' (3.128), node_3-node_2 area_id \'3\' (1.759), node_3-node_4 area_id \'2\' (0.782), node_1-node_3 area_id \'1\' (0.195). Calculate total mass = sum(length × area) ≈ (2×0.195)+(4×1.759)+(3.606×3.128)+(5×4.887)+(3×0.782) = 0.39+7.036+11.28+24.435+2.346=45.487 > 30 (too heavy). Reduce areas for less critical members: node_2-node_4 to \'3\' (1.759), node_1-node_4 to \'2\' (0.782), node_3-node_2 to \'2\' (0.782), node_3-node_4 to \'1\' (0.195), node_1-node_3 to \'0\' (1). New mass ≈ (2×1)+(4×0.782)+(3.606×0.782)+(5×1.759)+(3×0.195) = 2+3.128+2.82+8.795+0.585=17.328 < 30.
