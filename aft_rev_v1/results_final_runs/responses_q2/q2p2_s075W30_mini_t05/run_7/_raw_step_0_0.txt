The design must ensure full connectivity and stability with minimal mass and stress.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes: node_1(0,0) pinned, node_2(6,0) roller, node_3(2,0) roller with a downward-left load (-15, -30) at node_3. The structure is currently a line of three nodes. A closed truss requires at least a triangle or more members forming closed loops. Minimum closed truss with 3 nodes is a triangle. But nodes are colinear on x-axis, so no triangle possible without adding nodes.",\n\n    "analysis": "The three given nodes lie on the x-axis: node_1 (0,0), node_3 (2,0), node_2 (6,0). Load at node_3 is diagonal downward-left. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2, node_3 (rollers). The current setup is unstable laterally and cannot resist the load effectively. To form a closed truss, we must add at least one node off the x-axis to create a triangle or polygon. This will enable triangulation for stability and load transfer. Members must be sized to keep stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 0.75 and total mass ≤ 30. The key failure mode is buckling or tension failure in members carrying diagonal load. Efficient load path would be from node_3 load transmitted to node_1 and node_2 via triangulated members.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a single node above node_3 to form a triangle with node_1 and node_2 is optimal. This creates two triangles sharing the new node, providing closed loops and good triangulation. The new node can be placed at (3.0, 3.0) to balance geometry and length. Members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, plus the base members node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2. Avoid direct node_1-node_2 member to reduce mass and keep structure simple. Area IDs should be assigned based on member length and expected force to minimize mass but keep stresses low.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Triangulation is essential for stability and load distribution. The new node_4 at (3.0,3.0) forms two triangles: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_3-node_2-node_4, closing the truss. This arrangement directs the load from node_3 to supports at node_1 and node_2 efficiently. Members connected to node_4 will carry tension and compression. Assign larger area IDs to longer or higher force members and smaller area IDs to shorter or lower force members to optimize mass and stress. This design respects boundary conditions and load directions.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic behavior, uniform material density, stress proportional to axial force / area. Member length = Euclidean distance between nodes. Mass = sum(length × area). Stress-to-weight ratio = max(abs(force/area)) / total_mass. Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_2 = 4.0, node_1-node_4 ≈ 4.24, node_2-node_4 ≈ 3.16, node_3-node_4 ≈ 3.16. Force balance equations at nodes considering supports and loads. Calculate axial forces, then assign area IDs from given set to keep stresses ≤ 0.75 × total_mass.",\n\n    "calculation": "Member lengths: L13=2.0, L32=4.0, L14=√((3-0)^2+(3-0)^2)=4.2426, L24=√((6-3)^2+(0-3)^2)=4.2426, L34=√((3-2)^2+(3-0)^2)=3.1623. Approximate axial forces under load (-15, -30) at node_3 by static equilibrium: load splits roughly equally to node_1 and node_2 through node_4. Estimated max member force ≈ 35 units. Assign area IDs to keep max stress/weight ≤ 0.75 and total mass ≤ 30. Choose area_id \'3\' (1.759) for longer members (L14, L24), \'2\' (0.782) for medium (L34), and \'1\' (0.195) for short base members (L13, L32). Calculate mass: (2.0×0.195)+(4.0×0.195)+(4.2426×1.759)+(4.2426×1.759)+(3.1623×0.782) ≈ 0.39+0.78+7.46+7.46+2.47=18.56 < 30. Max stress approx force/area = 35/1.759=19.9, stress-to-weight ratio = 19.9/18.56=1.07 > 0.75. Increase area for high force members to \'4\' (3.128) for L14 and L24. New mass: 0.39+0.78+(4.2426×3.128)+(4.2426×3.128)+2.47=0.39+0.78+13.26+13.26+2.47=30.16 ≈30. Slightly over, reduce L34 area to \'1\' (0.195): mass=0.39+0.78+13.26+13.26+(3.1623×0.195)=0.39+0.78+13.26+13.26+0.62=28.31 <30. Max stress=35/3.128=11.2, stress-to-weight ratio=11.2/28.31=0.4 < 0.75, constraints satisfied.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Final design: nodes 1,2,3 on x-axis; node_4 at (3.0, 3.0).
