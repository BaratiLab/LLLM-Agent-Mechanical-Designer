Constraints: stress-to-weight <=0.75 and mass <=30. Initial structure is a line with no closure; need to add nodes/members for closed truss and triangulation.",\n\n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 has horizontal and vertical components (-15*cos30°, -15*sin30°) ≈ (-13, -7.5) N. Supports at node_1 pinned (restrains x,y) and node_2 roller (restrains vertical). Node_3 roller allows horizontal displacement only, so horizontal load at node_3 is unrestrained, implying need for horizontal load path to ground. Current nodes colinear, no triangulation, unstable against lateral loads. To form a closed truss, add a node above line to form a triangle. Triangular geometry provides stable load path and distributes forces efficiently, reducing stresses. Members must be sized with appropriate areas to minimize stress-to-weight ratio. Mass calculated as sum(length * area).",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Triangular truss formed by nodes 1,2 and new node 4 above line. Node 3 is on the bottom chord. To include node_3 in closed structure, connect node_3 to node_4 and node_1/node_2. This forms multiple triangles and load paths. Area selection can prioritize smaller areas in tension members and larger in compression. The load at node_3 can be transferred to supports via these triangulated members. The design must ensure that max stress / total_weight <=0.75 and total mass <=30.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Add node_4 at midpoint between node_1 and node_2 horizontally (3.0, y) with y>0 to form an isosceles triangle. Connect node_4 to node_1, node_2, and node_3. Members: (1-3), (3-2), (1-4), (2-4), (3-4). This forms closed truss with multiple triangles. Use areas: small areas (0.195, 0.782) for tension members and larger (3.128, 4.887) for compression members. Node_4 placed at y=3.0 to balance height and member lengths. This reduces member length and stress. The design ensures load transfer from node_3 to supports through triangulated members.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Material density uniform, stress proportional to force / area, force from static equilibrium. Calculate member lengths via distance formula. Calculate forces by solving equilibrium at nodes (sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0). Calculate stress = force / area. Calculate total mass = sum(length * area). Calculate max stress / total mass. Adjust areas to satisfy constraints. Node_4 coordinates: (3.0, 3.0). Members: (1-3), (3-2), (1-4), (2-4), (3-4).

Forces calculated by equilibrium (approx): max force ~ 15N, stress max = force/area. Max stress ~ 15/0.195=76.92 (arbitrary units), total mass = sum(length*area) = 2*0.782 +4*0.782 +4.243*3.128*2 +3.162*0.195 = approx 1.564 + 3.128 + 26.54 + 0.616 = 31.848 (slightly above 30). Reduce (1-4) and (2-4) areas to 1.759 each: mass= 1.564 + 3.128 + 14.91 + 0.616 = 20.22 <30. Max stress now ~ 15/0.195=76.92, stress-to-weight=76.92/20.22=3.8 >0.75. Increase area of tension member (3-4) to 1.759: max stress=15/1.759=8.53, stress-to-weight=8.53/20.22=0.42 <0.75. Final mass=20.22 + (1.759-0.195)*3.162=20.22+5.15=25.37 <30.
