Design includes additional nodes and members to form triangulated closed structure for load path efficiency and weight control.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes: node_1(0,0, pinned), node_2(6,0, roller), node_3(2,0, roller) with load at node_3 (-15N, -30N). The structure is a line initially, which is not closed or stable under vertical load. Need to add nodes and members to form a closed, triangulated truss. Constraints limit mass and stress-to-weight ratio. Area IDs range from 0 to 10 with known weights.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current nodes are colinear along x-axis, which cannot resist vertical load effectively. Supports: node_1 pinned (fixed x,y), node_2 roller (vertical reaction only), node_3 roller (vertical reaction only). Load at node_3 is downward and leftward, inducing bending and shear if only horizontal members present. To resist moment and vertical load, triangulation is necessary. Adding a node above node_3 to form a triangle will create axial forces in members, reducing bending. Members should be chosen to balance stress and weight. Mass calculation depends on member length and area. Max stress-to-weight ratio <=0.75 means stress and weight must be balanced. Closed structure means all nodes connected with no isolated nodes.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation is key: adding a node above node_3 to form two triangles: node_1-node_3-new_node and node_3-node_2-new_node. This will transfer vertical load into axial forces. Use minimal area members on longer members to save weight, larger areas near load/supports for strength. Avoid overly large members to keep mass low. The added node should be near node_3 but above it to efficiently transfer vertical load. Lengths and forces must be calculated to check stress and mass constraints.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Introduce node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) above node_3 to form triangles (node_1-node_3-node_4) and (node_3-node_2-node_4). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4. This forms two triangles with a vertical member from node_3 to node_4. Use larger area for vertical member under load (node_3-node_4) and smaller areas for diagonals and base members to balance weight. This closed triangulated structure will distribute load efficiently, minimizing max stress and total mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic behavior, axial forces only. Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance. Calculate forces using static equilibrium: sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, sum M=0 at supports. Compute member forces by method of joints or sections. Calculate stress as force/area. Mass = sum(length * area). Use area values from given dictionary. Ensure max(abs(stress))/mass <=0.75 and mass <=30.

Calculate forces by equilibrium: vertical load at node_3 = -30N, horizontal -15N. Vertical reactions at node_1 and node_2 sum to 30N.
