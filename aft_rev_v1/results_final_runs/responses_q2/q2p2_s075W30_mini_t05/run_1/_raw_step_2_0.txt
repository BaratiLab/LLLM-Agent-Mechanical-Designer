Objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss satisfying stress-to-weight <= 0.75 and mass <= 30, preserving load/support nodes.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given load at node_3 downward-left; supports pinned at node_1, rollers at node_2 and node_3. Current design has 4 members, no closed loop, high stress concentration on member_4 (node_2-node_1). History shows a denser 5-member structure with higher mass but also constraint violation. Constraints require lowering max stress or increasing weight without exceeding mass limit.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure is a simple 3-node base with one elevated node_4. Load at node_3 causes high stress in member_4 (base member node_1-node_2). The structure is not fully triangulated or closed; lacks redundancy. History structure added diagonal members forming closed loops but mass increased beyond limit. To reduce stress-to-weight ratio, need to distribute load better and increase structural redundancy. Node_3 is on base line with roller support, limiting vertical reaction. Node_4 position and member areas are critical. Using larger area members on critical tension/compression paths and triangulating the structure will improve load distribution and reduce max stress. Node_3 position fixed, so adding a diagonal from node_1 to node_3 and node_3 to node_2 to close the triangle is beneficial. Elevate node_4 slightly lower than previous 3.5m to reduce member lengths and mass. Member areas chosen to balance strength and mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: closed triangular loops reduce stress concentration, adding diagonals helps. High stress on base member suggests load path is direct through base, so adding diagonal members can distribute forces. Area 1.0 (area_id \'0\') is light but low strength; area 3.128 (area_id \'4\') is heavier but stronger. Use larger areas on critical diagonals and smaller on base members to keep mass under 30. Node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) from history structure is good compromise for height and mass.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Adopt structure similar to history constraint_not_met_1 but reduce member areas to lower mass and adjust node_4 slightly. Use 5 members forming closed trapezoid with diagonal: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_4-node_3, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2. Node_4 at (2.0, 3.0).

Node_4 elevated to transfer load from node_3 diagonally to supports. Diagonal members from node_1 to node_3 and node_3 to node_2 close the loop and reduce bending. Assign larger areas to diagonals carrying tension/compression from load. Base members smaller areas to reduce mass. Node_3 fixed at (2.0, 0.0) due to load and support. Node_1 and node_2 fixed at (0.0,0.0) and (6.0,0.0). Node_4 repositioned at (2.0, 3.0) for optimal height.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths using distance formula.
