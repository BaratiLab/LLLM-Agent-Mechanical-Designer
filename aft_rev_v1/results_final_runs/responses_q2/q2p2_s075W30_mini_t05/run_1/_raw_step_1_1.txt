Objective is to redesign a closed truss satisfying stress and mass limits, while keeping loaded and supported nodes fixed.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Loads: node_3 has a downward-left force (-15, -30). Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 and node_3 rollers. Nodes 1,2,3 fixed on x-axis; node_4 elevated at y=3. Current members connect nodes 1-4, 4-2, 4-3, 1-3, 3-2. High stress in member_4 (1-3) suggests direct horizontal member overloaded. Mass dominated by members 1 and 2 with area 4.0. Constraints violated due to large cross-sectional areas and inefficient load paths.",\n  "analysis": "The load at node_3 is large and downward-left, inducing tension/compression in members connected to node_3. The horizontal member_4 (1-3) shows max stress near 50, indicating it is overloaded and likely causes the high stress-to-weight ratio. Members 1 and 2 with large areas increase mass significantly. The structure lacks sufficient triangulation around node_3 to distribute forces effectively. The current structure is not optimally distributing load to supports. The roller at node_3 limits vertical reaction, increasing stress in horizontal member_4. The closed truss should better triangulate load paths, reduce member lengths and areas, and avoid overloaded horizontal members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Key insight: the horizontal member_4 is a failure point. The load at node_3 needs better transfer through diagonal members to pinned node_1 and roller node_2. Adding a diagonal member from node_2 to node_1 and repositioning node_4 to improve triangulation can help. Reducing cross-sectional areas on overloaded members while increasing on others may optimize mass and stress. Maintaining fixed nodes 1,2,3 positions is mandatory. Node_4 can be adjusted vertically and horizontally to improve geometry.",\n  "proposal": "Redesign the truss by repositioning node_4 higher and slightly to right to form better triangles with nodes 1, 2, and 3. Add a diagonal member from node_2 to node_1 to close the truss fully and distribute load. Remove the direct horizontal member between nodes 1 and 3 to reduce stress concentration. Use moderate cross-sectional areas for diagonals and smaller areas for horizontal members to minimize mass while controlling stress.",\n  "reasoning": "A triangular truss with nodes 1,2,4 and node_3 connected diagonally to node_4 and node_2 will better distribute forces. Node_4 raised to ~3.5m and shifted to ~3.5m horizontally balances load paths. Diagonal members take tension/compression efficiently. Removing member 1-3 reduces direct overload. Using area_id \'3\' (1.759) for diagonals and \'1\' (0.195) for shorter horizontals balances mass and stress. Supports remain fixed; node_4 repositioning improves geometry and load transfer.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(3.5,3.5). Members: 1-4, 4-2, 4-3, 2-1. Lengths approx: 1-4 ~4.95, 4-2 ~3.54, 4-3 ~4.3, 2-1 = 6.0. Cross-sectional areas assigned: diagonals (1-4,4-2,4-3) area_id \'3\' (1.759), horizontal 2-1 area_id \'1\' (0.195). Member stresses estimated by force equilibrium and load distribution: diagonals carry main load, horizontal 2-1 carries compressive force to balance. Total mass sum(length*area) estimated ~ (4.95+3.54+4.3)*1.759 + 6*0.195 = 23.7 + 1.17 = 24.87 < 30.
