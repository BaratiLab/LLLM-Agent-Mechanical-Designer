Objective is to minimize max stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 0.75 and total mass ≤ 30 using given discrete area sizes.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes form a line on x-axis at y=0: node_1(0,0), node_3(2,0), node_2(6,0). Load (-15, -30) acts at node_3. Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 & node_3 rollers. Need closed truss (cycle), so at least one additional node is needed to form a triangle for stability and load transfer. Areas must be chosen from discrete set. Initial idea: add one node above node_3 to create a triangle, connect all nodes, and size members to balance load and minimize stress-to-weight ratio.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current nodes are collinear; no triangulation exists, so structure is unstable for lateral loads. Load at node_3 is downward and leftward (-15 horizontal, -30 vertical). Node_1 pinned can resist both horizontal and vertical reactions; node_2 roller resists vertical only; node_3 roller resists vertical only. To resist horizontal load, members must transfer horizontal reactions mainly to node_1. Introducing a node above node_3 allows triangulation and load path. Members from node_1 to new node, new node to node_2, and new node to node_3 form a triangle to carry load efficiently. Member sizing must balance axial forces to keep stress low while minimizing weight.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "A single additional node above node_3 at y>0 creates a triangular geometry. Triangulation stabilizes structure and distributes forces. Load path: node_3 load transfers via diagonal members to node_1 and node_2. Members along bottom chord (node_1 to node_3 to node_2) carry compression/tension. Diagonals carry shear. Using moderate area sizes on diagonals and smaller areas on chords can reduce mass. Check member lengths and forces to select area IDs that meet stress-to-weight ratio and mass constraints.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) above node_3 to form triangle (node_1, node_2, node_4). Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_4-node_3, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2. This closed loop ensures stability. Node_4 placed at y=3 to balance vertical load transfer and keep member lengths reasonable. Use larger areas on diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_4-node_3) and smaller areas on bottom chord members (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2). This distributes stresses and keeps overall weight low. Supports reactions mainly at node_1 (pinned) and vertical at node_2, node_3 rollers.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic axial members, uniform cross-section per member, unit density for mass calculation proportional to length × area. Calculate member lengths using distance formula. Estimate axial forces by static equilibrium: sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, sum moments=0. Approximate member forces assuming pinned joints and axial load transfer. Use given area sizes from 0 to 10. Compute mass = sum(length × area). Compute max(abs(stress)) = max(|force|/area). Calculate stress-to-weight = max(abs(stress))/mass and verify ≤0.75.

Reduce areas on diagonals to \'3\' (1.759) and chords to \'1\' (0.195). New mass ≈ (3.6056×1.759)+(4.1231×1.759)+(3.0×1.759)+(2.0×0.195)+(4.0×0.195) ≈ 6.34+7.25+5.28+0.39+0.78=19.99 <30 good. Estimate forces: load at node_3 (-15,-30). Using static equilibrium and triangulation, max axial force approx 35 units on diagonal members. Stress = force/area. Using area=1.759, stress=35/1.759=19.9. Stress-to-weight=19.9/19.99=0.995 >0.75 constraint violated.
