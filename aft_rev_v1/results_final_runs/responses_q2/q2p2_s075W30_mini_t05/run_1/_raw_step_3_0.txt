The objective is to redesign a closed, fully triangulated truss that satisfies all constraints, minimizing stress-to-weight ratio and total mass <=30, while keeping nodes with loads and supports fixed.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given load at node_3 (-15, -30), supports pinned at node_1 and rollers at nodes_2 and 3. Current node_4 is at (2.0, 3.0). Members connect nodes forming a partial truss but with high stress in member_4 (node_1-node_3). Stress-to-weight ratio is too high (2.4597 > 0.75). Mass is within limit (21.58 < 30). Current structure is not fully triangulated and likely inefficient load path.",\n\n    "analysis": "The load at node_3 is downward and to the left. Node_1 is pinned (fixed in both directions), node_2 and node_3 have roller supports (restrained vertically or horizontally). The current structure has a diagonal member_4 (node_1-node_3) highly stressed (-53.09), indicating it bears large tension/compression. Members from node_4 to nodes 1, 2, 3 form a triangle but node_4 is only connected to those nodes, making the structure not fully triangulated between supports and load nodes. Historic structures with node_4 repositioned (e.g., at (3.5, 3.5)) improved stress-to-weight ratio but still violated constraints. The mass tends to increase with larger area members. The current member areas (mostly \'3\') may be insufficient for the heavy load on member_4. A closed truss with full triangulation including members between all nodes except those fixed by supports is needed to distribute load better and reduce peak stress. Keeping nodes_1, 2, 3 fixed in position is mandatory due to supports and load.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns show that increasing node_4 height or moving it right improves load distribution but increases mass. Using larger area members reduces stress but increases mass. The critical member is node_1-node_3, which should be replaced or supported by additional triangulation. Adding a member between node_1-node_2 and node_2-node_3 can close the truss and improve force paths. The structure should be symmetric in horizontal direction to balance loads and minimize bending. The load path should transfer forces from node_3 through node_4 to supports at nodes_1 and 2 efficiently.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss by fixing nodes_1, 2, 3 positions as given. Reposition node_4 to (3.0, 3.0) to improve symmetry and load path. Add members to fully triangulate the structure: node_1-node_2, node_2-node_3, and node_1-node_3. Select area_ids to balance stress and mass: use medium areas (e.g., \'2\' or \'3\') for main diagonals and smaller areas for horizontal members. This closed, fully triangulated truss will reduce stress concentration and meet constraints.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Load at node_3 is downward-left; node_4 at (3.0, 3.0) symmetrizes the top chord. Adding member node_1-node_2 closes the base triangle, node_2-node_3 and node_1-node_3 close lower triangles, distributing forces. Triangulation ensures no mechanism and better load transfer. Medium area members on diagonals carry axial forces with lower stress; smaller areas on horizontal members reduce mass. This improves structural efficiency, lowering max stress and stress-to-weight ratio below 0.75, while keeping total mass <=30.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic behavior, axial forces only, uniform material density. Calculate member lengths using distance formula. Approximate member forces by static equilibrium at nodes. Estimate stress = force / area. Mass = length × area (area from area_id). Choose area_ids to keep max stress / total mass <= 0.75. Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_4-node_3, node_1-node_2, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_3.
