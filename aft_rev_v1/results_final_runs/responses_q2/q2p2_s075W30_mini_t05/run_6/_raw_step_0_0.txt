Objective is to minimize stress-to-weight ratio while respecting mass and stress constraints.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given three colinear nodes with load at node_3 (2,0), supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Need a closed truss, so must add at least one node off the line to enable triangulation and load transfer. Constraints: stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 0.75, mass ≤ 30. Areas from given discrete set.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The three nodes lie on x-axis, which is structurally inefficient under vertical/horizontal loads. Load at node_3 is (-15, -30) N (leftward and downward). Supports fix node_1 fully and node_2 vertically (roller). Without vertical triangulation, bending and large stresses occur in members. Introducing a new node above node_3 to form two triangles will distribute load efficiently. Members must connect all nodes forming closed loops. Use members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_2, and new node above node_3 connected to node_1, node_2, and node_3, forming a triangulated closed structure.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a node at (2.0, 3.0) above node_3 creates two triangles: (node_1, node_3, new_node) and (node_3, node_2, new_node). This distributes load paths and reduces member stresses. Triangulation ensures no mechanism and better load transfer. Use moderate area members on longer spans and smaller areas on shorter members to reduce mass. Check member lengths and forces to select area_ids.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangulation is key to closed truss stability and stress distribution. Placing new node vertically above node_3 at y=3.0 balances height for load transfer and minimal member length. Connect new node to node_1, node_2, and node_3 to close the truss. Use smaller cross-sectional areas on shorter members to save mass. Calculate member forces by static equilibrium and select areas to keep max stress below allowable limit derived from stress-to-weight ratio constraint.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members carry axial forces only, linear elastic behavior, uniform material density, load applied at node_3 only. Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance. Calculate axial forces by static equilibrium (sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, sum moments=0). Estimate max stress = max force / area. Mass = sum(length × area). Stress-to-weight = max(abs(stress)) / mass ≤ 0.75. Area values from given set. Use trial area selection starting from small to larger areas to meet constraints.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1 (0.0,0.0), node_2 (6.0,0.0), node_3 (2.0,0.0), new_node_4 (2.0,3.0). Members: m1: node_1-node_3 (length 2.0), m2: node_3-node_2 (length 4.0), m3: node_1-node_2 (length 6.0), m4: node_1-node_4 (length sqrt(2^2+3^2)=3.606), m5: node_3-node_4 (length 3.0), m6: node_2-node_4 (length sqrt(4^2+3^2)=5.0). Assign area_ids: m1=3 (1.759), m2=4 (3.128), m3=1 (0.195), m4=2 (0.782), m5=2 (0.782), m6=3 (1.759). Calculate mass = sum(length*area): 2*1.759=3.518 + 4*3.128=12.512 + 6*0.195=1.17 + 3.606*0.782=2.82 + 3*0.782=2.346 + 5*1.759=8.795 Total mass=31.16 (slightly above 30). Reduce m3 area from 1 to 0 (area_id \'0\' = 1) to save mass: new mass = 31.16 - 1.17 + 6*1=6 = 36.0 (too high), so keep m3=1. Instead reduce m6 area from 3 to 2: 5*0.782=3.91 instead of 8.795. New mass = 31.16 - 8.795 + 3.91 = 26.275 ≤ 30. Calculate forces by equilibrium, max force ~ 50 N, max stress = force / area. Largest stress member is m2 with force ~50 N / 3.128 = 16.0.
