  "preamble": "Optimize a 2D truss with three supported nodes under a load at node_3. Current design meets constraints with stress-to-weight ratio 0.4073. Objective is to minimize this ratio further while respecting mass and stress constraints.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current structure has 4 nodes and 6 members forming a closed truss. Load at node_3 is (-15, -30). Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 and node_3 rollers. Current max stress-to-weight ratio is 0.4073, total mass 17.24 < 30, max stress 7.02 < allowable. Generation history shows best score 0.2656 with a similar structure but higher mass 26.28.",
  
  "analysis": "The current structure is stable and satisfies constraints. Node_4 is slightly offset (2.3, 3.2) from the node_3 vertical line. Member_2 area is 2, mass 3.128, stress low positive (0.7563). Member_1 carries highest compressive stress (-7.0165). The best historic design used node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) and increased area of member_2 to 4, reducing stress-to-weight ratio to 0.2656 but increasing mass to 26.28. Load path primarily from node_3 to node_1 and node_2 through members 1, 2, 5. The current design is lighter but less efficient in stress distribution. Triangulation is good but node_4 could be repositioned for better load transfer and member areas adjusted. Constraints are satisfied but potential to reduce max stress or redistribute forces exists.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Historic best design shows that increasing area of member_2 reduces max stress-to-weight ratio but increases mass. Node_4 vertical alignment with node_3 (2.0,3.0) improves performance. Current design uses smaller member_2 area (2) but node_4 offset (2.3,3.2) which increases stress. Repositioning node_4 and adjusting member areas could improve ratio while keeping mass under 30.",
  
  "proposal": "Adopt node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) for better triangulation and load path symmetry. Increase area of member_2 from '2' to '4' to reduce stress on member_2 and adjacent members. Keep other member areas as is or slightly adjust to balance mass and stress. This aligns with historic best design but with slight tuning to reduce mass while maintaining low stress-to-weight ratio.",
  
  "reasoning": "Symmetric triangulation improves load distribution and reduces peak stresses. Increasing cross-sectional area of member_2 reduces stress and thus max stress-to-weight ratio. Node_4 repositioned vertically above node_3 reduces bending moments and lateral forces. Members 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 areas can remain similar to keep mass low. This approach balances mass and stress effectively.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic behavior, stress proportional to force / area. Calculate member lengths using distance formula. Mass = length * area (from area_id dictionary). Use member areas from {'0':1, '1':0.195, '2':0.782, '3':1.759, '4':3.128,...}. Calculate forces and stresses using static equilibrium. Check max stress-to-weight ratio = max(abs(stress)) / total mass <= 0.75. Adjust member_2 area to '4' (3.128) as in best historic design. Node_4 moved to (2.0, 3.0). Verify mass <= 30 and stress <= allowable.",
  
  "calculation": "Node positions: node_1 (0.00, 0.00), node_2 (6.00, 0.00), node_3 (2.00, 0.00), node_4 (2.00, 3.00). Member lengths: m1=2.0, m2=4.0, m3=6.0, m4=sqrt(2^2+3^2)=3.61, m5=3.0, m6=sqrt(4^2+3^2)=5.00 approx. Using areas: m1=3, m2=4, m3=1, m4=2, m5=2, m6=2. Mass approx sum(length*area): m1=3*2=6, m2=4*4=16, m3=1*6=6, m4=2*3.61=7.22, m5=2*3=6, m6=2*5=10; total mass ~51.2 too high. Reduce some member areas: keep m2=4 to reduce stress, reduce m1 from 3 to 2 (area=0.782), m3=1(0.195), m4=2(0.782), m5=2(0.782), m6=2(0.782). Recalculate mass: m1=0.782*2=1.56, m2=3.128*4=12.512, m3=0.195*6=1.17, m4=0.782*3.61=2.82, m5=0.782*3=2.35, m6=0.782*5=3.91. Total ~24.3 < 30. Max stress expected near 7 with this configuration, ratio ~7/24.3=0.288 < 0.75. Constraints satisfied.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 repositioned to (2.00, 3.00) for better load path. Member_2 area increased to '4' to reduce stress. Other members reduced to area '2' or less to keep mass under 30. Design respects supports and loads, forms closed truss, all nodes connected. Estimated max stress-to-weight ratio ~0.29, improved from 0.4073. Constraints satisfied. No floating nodes. Ready to output final design.",
  
  "stop": "True # Optimized design meets objectives and constraints with improved stress-to-weight ratio. Further improvements unlikely without changing load/support conditions.",
