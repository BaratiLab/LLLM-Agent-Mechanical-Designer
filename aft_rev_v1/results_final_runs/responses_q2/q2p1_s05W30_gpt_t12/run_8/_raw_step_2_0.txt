Core constraints: max stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 0.5, total mass ≤ 30. Generate a valid closed truss, minimally weighted, all constraints met.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Structure has three basal nodes: node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 (roller), all y=0. node_4 is an elevated interior node; all loads act on node_3. Both the current and historic structures have a member (node_4, node_3, area 3) attracting high compression/tension. Major issue: high max stress (e.g., -45), unsatisfactory stress-to-weight ratios (>1). Must redesign.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Existing designs try to distribute loads via tall positions for node_4 and use area-3 for diagonal/compression-critical members, but under-size critical members, especially the lower horizontal (node_1-node_3/node_2), leading to localization of extreme stress. The connections can lack full triangulation or have undersized areas under the load. There\'s evidence the layout is a variant of a Warren/Pratt truss but with insufficient inertia for lowest members. Improving triangulation, optimizing the raised node for central load sharing, and appropriately sizing member areas (especially the bottom chord under tension) are required for constraint satisfaction.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: lower chord stressed most (up to -45), and smallest (area_1 or area_0). Large compression along vertical/diagonal members handled acceptably with area~3, not optimal. Both weight & stress bounds may be improved by moving/adding central node slightly, expanding triangulation, boosting critical area below the point load (node_3), and slightly upscaling key diagonals. Historic designs with extra diagonals reduced max stress by ~20%, suggesting further closing improves redistribution.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign: keep all required support/load nodes, introduce node_5 as a symmetric off-axis node to allow load split and lean triangulation, shift node_4 vertically down a bit to reduce extreme lever arm. Ensure full triangulated closed circuits across all non-collinear nodes. Increase bottom chord member areas under load (to area_4), slightly boost diagonals, minimally size top chord. Omit redundant members from initial suboptimal designs. Net result: closed, symmetrical, minimally-massed triangle lattice absorbing moment from node_3. All members fully connected.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By applying statics and stress distribution logic, make two strong diagonals from node_3 down to nodes_1/2, enlarge (area_3 → area_4) the lower base member between nodes supported (crucial, always highly stressed in prior runs), maintain a more compact height for the raised node to reduce member weighting, use bans (strict maximum areas) elsewhere. Add an extra triangulation node if necessary. Size all vertical/diagonal member cross-sections according to local max stress. Use symmetry with respect to x=3 and load location.",\n \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Key assumptions: geometry symmetrical about x=3. Use T-section with base at y=0: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0); top node will go at midpoint plus offset: node_4(3.0,2.25), a new node_5 left-of-load node (1.7,1.1). Main diagonal members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4; node_1-node_3 & node_3-node_2 must be beefy (area_4); top chord (node_1-node_2) can be small (area_1); diagonals for node_1-node_5 and node_2-node_5, if needed further, will add only if mass under limit. Anticipated force in bottom member ≈ 18-20 (from prior max stress). Area of 3.128 yields σ ≈ 20/3.128 ≈ 6.4 < allowable by constraint from stress-to-weight (<0.5) so, further stress redistribution expected by adding triangulation. Estimate member lengths and mass sum: aim ≈ 19–24 kg.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Length(node_1–node_4) = sqrt(3^2 + 2.25^2)=~3.77; similar for node_2–node_4. node_3-node_4 = sqrt(1^2 + 2.25^2) ≈ 2.47. node_1-node_3 = 2.0; node_3-node_2=4.0; node_1-node_2=6.0. Major members likely handle <14 (if load distributed efficiently), so area requirements light except at bottom chord. Mass = Σ(length × area); estimated ~3.77×1.759 + 2.47×1.759 + (2+4)×3.128 + 6×0.195 ≈ 6.63+4.35+18.77+1.17≈31 (so swap lower member to area_3 for <=30 if needed). Stress is then max_tension ≈ 20/area=11 < mass/weight. With redistribution, expect σmax/m_total ≤ 0.5.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Re-compute all member stresses with improved load path; compress or fine tune y of node_4 depending on area sum. Check that m_total < 30 and σmax/weight < 0.5. Further reduce top members to save area if sum too high, or use area_1 for minimal masses, but bottom chord ≥ area_3. Ensure no node is isolated.
