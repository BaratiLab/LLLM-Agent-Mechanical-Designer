Previous designs failed the constraints: the mass (best: 37.46) and stress-to-weight ratio (best: 0.0996) were both too high. The goal is to generate a new truss structure that both fully satisfies the constraints (stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 0.5, total mass ≤ 30) and is as optimal as possible using strategic member selection and node placement, maintaining all connection/geometry instructions.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Key constraints: all nodes supported or loaded are fixed, truss must be closed and minimal. History shows attempts to use both strong/heavy and lightweight sparse trusses — neither gave feasible mass nor stress ratios. Triangular arrangement is natural due to boundary and load conditions. Heavily loaded members need appropriate sizing but the overall mass budget is titan, so optimal layout, judicious selection of cross-sectional areas, and reduced span/heavy members is essential.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Existing and past structures have been arch/spandrel-like, with upper joint nodes forming either gentle or steep arches away from the loaded node_3. Most were overbuilt (large mass) or dangerously slender on the bottom (overstressed, e.g., structure 3 at 45.2 stress). Member area assignments in long/unbraced members pushed mass limits, and heavy upper chords for redistribution also accumulated significant mass. The wide span (node_1–node_2 at 6m) with the heavy node_3 demand, encourages a configuration that eliminates non-essential top chord length while providing direct load paths to supports.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Stress-to-weight ratio in the best feasible run was low (0.0996), but mass excessive. Slimming unnecessarily strong members is logical, but care to avoid boosting stress above ratio constraint. Overlong web or diagonals increase mass. Structure #3 (near-vertical web) overstressed the lower member, showing the lowest-weight designs—unless well triangulated or with intermediate supports—are most vulnerable. Getting significant mass fall while meeting load requirements needs an efficient, minimal member approach; lowering upper ortipodal node(s), then ensuring every load path is stabilizing, closely triangulated, and all force-dense members are thick where needed but not otherwise.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign around \'minimal mass, full load-triangle\', using as few nodes/members as closure permits. Deploy a classic direct-load triangle: node_4 added directly above midpoint between node_1/node_2, forming two gently sloped diagonals from node_3 up to node_4 and from node_4 down to node_1 and node_2. Reduce vertical rise from previous designs, balancing stress and span. Strategic member sizing: beef up only the two main diagonals and keep all other elements minimal. Final mass and stress must meet limits by intelligent area assignments.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation allows efficient transfer of vertical and horizontal components of the applied force at node_3, distributing loads to supports with short direct load paths. The apex node_4\'s x at 3.0 (centered) and y lowered noticeably below earlier attempts (≤2.0) shortens diagonal members, and moves their axial stress up (per geometry, F/L effect) but difference in angle lowers component demand on ties. Limiting mass requires using the smallest permissible areas on mainly unloaded members. Members under greatest tension or compression (top apex out to node_3 and base to node_2 or node_1 to apex base corner) get next-step cross-section. This layout closes all cut-sets, preserves closeness of lower boundary geometry, minimizes support-joint overbuild, and gives economic span.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Material is uniform, yield under constraint. Assign cross-sectional area \'1\' (min beyond 0) to lightly stressed links, perhaps \'0\' to members with near zero force (just to ensure closed truss and stability), and use \'2\' (a=0.782) or \'3\' (a=1.759) for heavily loaded members. Member selection via calculation: - Determine force in diagonals: vertical load splits roughly accordint to geometry; their length is sqrt((3-2)^2 + (h)^2) with apex at around y≅1.7~1.8. - Member length reductions directly reduce mass; check new truss triangle with the apex at (3, 1.8).. - Form load paths: node_3 is loaded, node_1 and node_2 transfer load; apex helps by direct triangulation. - Mass calc = Σ(length × area_value). If slightly over limit, nudge chord up/(down) or reduce member size where stresses are lowest, tracking that the stress-ratio <=0.5 after member slimming. Enforce structure closure.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Let node_4 = (3.0, 1.80).

Divide between two diagonals (~1.90m), each must transmit about half in tension (possibly less depending on geometry). Assign area_id as follows: keep node_1–node_2 and node_1–node_3 and node_2–node_3 at \'1\' for closure and prevention of mechanism (unless post-process shows force > allowed stress). Assign node_1–node_4, node_2–node_4 at \'2\' and node_3–node_4 at \'3\' (as these see highest force). Mass: (6.0 × 0.195) + (2.0 × 0.195) + (4.0 × 0.195) + (3.5 × 0.782) ×2 + (1.90 × 1.759) ≈ 1.17 + 0.39 + 0.78 + 5.473 + 3.343 ≈ 11.16.

To ensure stress/control, only area_id for major sloping diagonals and load tie at apex require notable magnitude.
