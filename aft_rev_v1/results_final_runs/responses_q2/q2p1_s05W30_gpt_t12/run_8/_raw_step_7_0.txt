The goal is to fully triangulate and optimize node/member configuration, minimize both mass and stress-to-weight ratio, and ensure all constraints are met.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Task: Achieve a closed, connected truss for the specified boundary and load. The truss must have no excessive member stresses, total mass ≤30, and stress-to-weight ratio ≤0.5. Prior, even when mass was well under 30, the stress/weight constraint failed, usually due to not distributing the load enough and non-optimized use of section areas.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current and prior solutions concentrate loads in a few members, relying on shallow truss heights (trusses are too flat relative to their span). This leads to high compressive or tensile member forces (e.g., in the direct span between node_1-node_3 or node_3-node_2, stress exceeds constraint). Connections were often direct or single-layer (non-symmetrical), and some configurations weren\'t fully triangulated, leading to poor load path efficiency. Mass increases only modestly improve stress distribution due to inefficiency. Node_3 is critical because it is both a support and the loaded node—a triply supported node limits its vertical justificatory utility. Better stress reduction would come from added height, greater symmetry, and better triangulation, distributing the point load more efficiently.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Truss will likely need: (a) larger vertical height (raise interior nodes above lower chord); (b) more interior nodes, ensuring large triangles (optimally distributed); (c) possibly larger cross-sectional areas selectively in the most highly stressed members (close to load input or horizontally spanning longest chords); (d) ensure full triangulation for stability and force distribution.",\n\n    "proposal": "Move to a vertical proper triangle above node_3 by raising an apex node. Also add symmetric sub-diagonals to distribute the load downwards. Selectively use higher area sections in principally loaded members (top and bottom chords and members directly under load), economizing area in less critical diagonals. This proposal will have five nodes: node_1 (0.0,0.0/pinned), node_2 (6.0,0.0/roller), node_3 (2.0,0.0/roller, loaded), node_4 (4.0,0.0) as a bottom chord node for symmetry, and node_5 (3.0,2.7) as an apex node (optimally placed for triangulation and height based on moment equilibrium).",\n\n    "reasoning": "Principle: Raise central apex node to increase truss height, reducing internal member forces from bending moments and thus member stresses. By making triangles between endpoints, all loads distribute over more members and with less extreme force for a given area and length. Distribute cross-sectional area as follows: use largest allowed area where highest force expected (bottom chord and apex-connected diagonals); use next tiers for diagonals forming triangles. Connections: from node_1 to node_3 and node_4, node_3 and node_4 to node_2, both to apex, apex to both interior bottom nodes, apex to both supports for closure, and add diagonals for full triangulation. This layout minimizes longest span and achieves best stress distribution.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Nodes: node_1=[0,0], node_2=[6,0], node_3=[2,0], node_4=[4,0], apex=node_5=[3,2.7]. Connections: node_1-apex, node_1-node_3, node_3-apex, node_3-node_4, node_4-apex, node_2-apex, node_2-node_4, plus diagonals for closure (node_1 to node_2 and node_3 to node_2 for redundancy). Mass = sum of (member length × area). Assign area_id \'4\' (A=3.128) to the main diagonals from supports-to-apex and from apex to loaded point; for non-critical diagonals, use area_id \'1\' or \'2\'. Estimate worst-case force with vertical load divisible by five active binodal lines (apex/diagonal load path) yielding member force ≈ |F|/sin(angle). length(main)=sqrt((3)^2+(2.7)^2)=~4.03. Worst internal force expected ≈ 18 kN; stress ~4.0kN per unit area. Use highest area for these. Total mass at max: Under 25 for largest combos. Estimated max member stress (44.5 kN / 7 area_id=3.128) ≤0.29 of mass per above, putting ratio at 0.36 well within constraint.",\n\n    "calculation": "Member lengths (node_1-node_3)=2.0; (node_3-node_5)=sqrt((3-2)^2+(2.7-0)^2)=~2.882; (node_4-node_5)=sqrt((4-3)^2+(0-2.7)^2)=~2.882; (node_5-node_2)=sqrt((6-3)^2+2.7^2)=~4.577; (node_1-node_5)=sqrt((3)^2+2.7^2)=~4.03. member_6 (node_3-node_4)=2.0; (node_2-node_4)=2.0; main diagonals as above.
