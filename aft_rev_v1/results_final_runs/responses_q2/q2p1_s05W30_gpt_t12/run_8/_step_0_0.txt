    "preamble": "Design a fully closed, statically determinate and efficient truss using three lower collinear nodes with a downward-diagonal load at node_3. The objective is to minimize the structure's stress-to-weight ratio under both equilibrium and manufacturability constraints while keeping the total mass under a specified value.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "We are given three nodes in a straight line: node_1 (pinned at left), node_2 (roller at right), and node_3 (roller+load in the interior at x=2.0). Loads act at node_3 and must transfer to supports. There are limited area sizes/IDs for members. We need all nodes to be connected and possibly to add one or more nodes for triangulation and stability without increasing mass beyond allowable limits.",
    
    "analysis": "With node_1 and node_2 fixed and the only load at node_3 angled downward-left, a simple three-member triangle among the collinear nodes gives weak compression/buckling in the lower horizontal 'base.' By adding a new node above the current collinear line and connecting all other nodes to it, full triangulation and redundant paths are ensured which distribute load efficiently. All supports are rollers/pinned, so vertical (Y) equilibrium is strict. Key risk: overlong, slender diagonal/toplevel members overstressed due to concentrated load without triangulation. Optimization requires shortest effective members where load is most direct, and thicker (appropriate area_ID) where force is highest to keep stress under constraint.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a single node directly above and between node_1 and node_2 offers good symmetry, condensed length for heavy diagonals, and limits member count for weight control. Connect all base nodes to this apex. Patterns: load at node_3 will create highest forces in nearest diagonals — optimize these first. Efficiency is improved by direct diagonal from the load application through the structure to closest support.",
    
    "reasoning": "Choose a single new apex node (node_4) high enough to improve triangulation and reduce force spread. Height optimally set such that all member lengths are similar, reducing both max force and total mass via minimal out-of-plane (vertical) extension for stiff, direct load path. Connect from node_3 to every other node, and apex to all base nodes.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Area_id selection via force estimation. Prism, height H above base; apex at (3.0, h), with h = 2.7 maximizing triangulation (keeps member length similar, mass controlled). Members: node_1 to node_4, node_2 to node_4, node_3 to node_4, short base node_1-node_2, and possibly node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3 for redundancy. Forces split among three main radiating truss members. Estimate: Loaded member must be >= node_3-node_4 diagonals. Use max length ~3.31m, load = sqrt((-15)**2 + (-30)**2) = ~33.54 kN. Start with area_ID '5' (4.887) for most loaded member and lower for others. Summing projected lengths × areas must remain under mass=30.",
    
    "calculation": "Placed apex at (3.0,2.7). Member lengths: node_1-node_4 = sqrt((3-0)^2 + (2.7-0)^2) = 4.01 m, node_2-node_4 = 4.01 m, node_3-node_4 = sqrt((3-2)^2 + (2.7-0)^2) = 2.88 m, node_1-node_3 = 2.0 m, node_2-node_3 = 4.0 m, node_1-node_2 = 6.0 m. Assign area '5' (4.887) only to node_3-node_4; assign area '3' (1.759) to other high-use members, area '1' (0.195) to closures. Total weight = 4.01×1.759 + 4.01×1.759 + 2.88×4.887 + 2.0×0.195 + 4.0×0.195 + 6.0×0.195 ≈ 7.05+7.05+14.07+0.39+0.78+1.17= 30.51 (>30). Switch node_3-node_4 to area '4' (3.128): 2.88×3.128=9.02, total ~25.46. Under stress check: max force = result of ~33.54/area >= ~10.73 MPa. Max(area) = 3.128; So, 33.54/3.128 ≈ 10.73. Max(abs(stress))/(total_mass) = (10.73/25.46) ≈ 0.42 (<0.5). All constraints satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "A single apex node above the base gives effective load distribution, all nodes connected, under max (mass 25.46<30), and max stress/weight ~0.42<0.5. Area assignments adjusted to fit constraint. All members, coordinates, areas, and logic are detailed for parsing.",
