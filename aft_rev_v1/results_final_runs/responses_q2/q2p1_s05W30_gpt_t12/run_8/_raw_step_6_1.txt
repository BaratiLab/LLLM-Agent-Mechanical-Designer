Previous iterations failed mainly due to excessive stress concentrations or superfluous mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "We are given three support nodes—two rollers, one pinned. There is a significant applied force at node_3. Current and historic trusses tend toward \'Warren\' or modified Pratt-like forms but do not achieve the stress/mass ratio limit. Problem is a span with a downward and leftward load at node_3, having trouble balancing stresses without mass violation or redundancy/inefficiency.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Reviewing the structures: Prior high-mass trusses (e.g., with large area_ids) solved the max_stress well, but total mass soared to 25–37.5. Leaner designs lower the mass (to ~5–12), but yield high max_stress-to-mass ratios (due to local member overload, particularly horizontal member_1 and close-to-nodal vertical geometries which interrupt load transfer efficiency). Geometry also placed upper nodes nearly directly above supports or off-truss-line, which doesn\'t fully exploit triangulation’s beneficial distribution. Most previous designs under-utilize the full triangle area above node_3 for arching. Adding a central top node directly above node_3 with refined member distribution (smaller area_ids, triangulation) could solve mass and stress simultaneously.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Overstressing of members between loaded node and supports; failure to distribute force properly across the entire structure. Insights: Adding another upper node to form a true triangulated Warren/Howe-ish truss with small area_id members gives better leverage and enables more slender elements, lowering both peak member stress and total mass.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign. Add an apex node (node_5) near midpoint, above node_3, forming two triangles left and right. Arrange all nodes so that supported nodes are endpoints of the base, with node_3 loaded at their intersection. Connect all lower nodes efficiently to node_5, ensuring every joint is the meeting of at least three members. Select the minimum area_id required (\'1\' or \'2\') for every member while checking for mass efficiency. Propose no unnecessary diagonals and enforce closed topology.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Double-triangulation or camelback-like shape improves load distribution. Vertical or moderately diagonal members from top apex down to node_3 and both base corners minimize direct stress from the force input, while bracing across from node_5 to base disperses the horizontal element of the load. Using small area_ids (<=\'2\') scheduled to keep mass below threshold, as higher values across whole truss would overshoot total mass constraint.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "- Anchor supports at node_1, node_2, node_3 only; - node_3 is load input at (2.0,0.0); - Add node_5 (top center); - network connections: node_5-node_1, node_5-node_2, node_5-node_3 for triangular coverage, and node_3 to node_1/node_2; - minimal area_id \'1\' or \'2\' as needed; - total length computations, pick highest-stressed member directions based on force projections.",\n    \n    "calculation": "For projected node_5 at (2.5,2.50): Distances and members: node_1-node_3 (2.0 m), node_3-node_2 (4.0 m), node_1-node_5 (√[(2.5)^2 + (2.5)^2]=3.54), node_2-node_5 (√[(3.5)^2 + (2.5)^2]=4.3), node_3-node_5 (√[(0.5)^2 + (2.5)^2]=2.55). Members: Tie base (1.0 m = previous geometry) with area_id \'1\' (.195), diagonals and verticals can stay on id \'1\' or bump up if stress needs. Apportioned force along diagonals ensures distributed loads. Estimated total mass is: 2.0×0.195 + 4.0×0.195 + 3.54×0.195 + 4.3×0.195 + 2.55×0.195 ≈ 0.39+0.78+0.69+0.84+0.50 = 3.20 << 30. Max absolute member stress estimated ≤1/3 of total force ≈ 16/3 = 5.3, so stress/mass=~1.7. However, using area_id \'2\' (0.782) instead for diagonals provides more capacity for only moderate mass increase: 3.54×0.782+4.3×0.782=6.04; Total mass ≈ 0.39+0.78+2.08+2.30+0.50 ≈ 6.05; now stress drops to <2, so ratio ≈0.3. Tweaking node_5 location farther from load further balances force projections, but at diminishing mass return.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Verify all nodes from lower segment remain fixed (per force/constraint), only new apex added, supporting best triangle arrangement.
