    "preamble": "This 2D truss task involves optimizing geometry and member sizing to meet strict stress-to-weight and mass limits under a downward, offset load. The current structure is light but fails the stress ratio constraint. The objective is to deliver a feasible, efficient design meeting all constraints, while keeping key support and loaded node locations fixed.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Current design approaches optimal mass but exceeds max(abs(stress))/mass <= 0.5. Loaded node_3 must remain at (2.0, 0.0), node_1 and node_2 and node_3 have prescribed supports. Opportunity: use wider triangulation and reinforce high-stressed members with larger areas.",
    "analysis": "Load at node_3 induces high stress avenues along members connecting node_1→node_3 and node_3→support nodes. Past structures show member_1 loads exceed 14, and total mass can meet limits even with area increases. Mass constraint is not restrictive, but stress ratio enforcement is difficult. The best historic design fell short (0.89) possibly due to insufficient area for highest-stressed member (node_1-node_3). Many historic layouts sacrificed efficiency by not triangulating or by inefficient pathing. Some past attempts with fewer triangles yielded excessive member loads. Effective connections from node_1 (pinned) to node_2 (roller) with upper chords transforming the moment are key.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "Key: Reduce force per unit area in critical members (e.g., node_1-node_3), ideally by increasing area or rerouting loads. Past over-lean/under-reinforced designs fell short. Use minimal nodes, closed triangles, and distribute force if possible to secondary chords. Alter node_4 and node_5 positions to help. A Warren truss with (1-3-5), (3-2), and diagonals above might offer better spread.",
    "proposal": "Redesign current structure to stronger, larger sections in heavily loaded members (node_1 - node_3; node_3 - node_2), enforce deeper truss geometry for force path tuning. Add or move top chord node to increase depth under node_3, allowing improved barycenter for lower chord. Enlarge key members, maintain all nodes structurally interlinked.",
    "reasoning": "Triangulated layouts minimize span forces. Placing top chord node above the span helps redirect vertical force along 'A-frame' elements. Increasing area in member_1 ('node_1' - 'node_3') and similarly for direct support paths reduces peak stress. Chosen geometry places node_4 high above node_3 (effectively halfway) to distribute loads evenly, taking advantage of zero-moment member diagonals. Select member areas based on computed/estimated max forces (via statics principles). Connect all nodes to ensure statical determinacy and redundancy. Prioritize critical yield bottlenecks, use symmetry if it helps.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Let’s introduce a node_4 (apex above loaded node) and node_5 and node_6 (offset left/right). Use large area in lower spans with high or negative force (node_1 - node_3 and node_3 - node_2), size others by expected stress. Area_id guide: use '6' for most critical (area=7.037), area '2' dim for secondary paths. Re-check structure closure for all supports/loading. Check if mass is under target (estimate each member mass, sum). Estimate resulting max stress in members based on simple plane resolution/post-processing. Adjust member areas again if margin requires tightening for constraint.",
    "calculation": "Assumptions: Most critical is member_1 (node_1-node_3), seeing nearly full load; size to anticipated max force (|F| ~ 15, min area required: A >= F/(allowed_stress)); give area_id '6' = 7.037 in those members; rest use area_id ‘2’ = 0.782 or ‘1’ = 0.195. Layout: Retain node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), put node_4 at (3.0,2.6) [apex], node_5 at (0.8,1.1), node_6 at (5.2,1.1). Members: lower chord (1-3-2), diagonals to apex and offsets to node_2. Mass: Each member length × area, all sum likely under 30.",
    "scratch_pad_final": "Redesign uses 6 nodes: all connected, forming a closed-web height truss, correct anchor locations, triangulated. Highest critical force paths sized largest, stress/calculated within constraints. Double-check all if mass < 30, stress/mass < 0.5: with 6 long spans (approx 2-3 units × 7.037 = ~14, for 2 members; others 2-4 units @ 0.782/0.195 adds <5 units; sum under limit; if ratio is still snug, make further strategic area increases).",
