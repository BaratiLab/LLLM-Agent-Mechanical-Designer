Current/historic designs fail constraints: max-stress-to-weight ratio far below allowed limit, but with mass greatly exceeding strict target. Objective: Achieve a closed, node-connected truss meeting stress-to-weight ratio <= 0.5 and total mass <= 30 while maintaining support and load conditions.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs specify pinned and roller supports on nodes_1/2/3 (all y=0), and a non-colinear load at node_3. Constraint tolerance is tight on mass (30). Past attempts reduced members and areas, but always exceed mass if using safe, oversized areas, or instantly exceed stress limit with undersized members.",\n\n    "analysis": "All viable structures are overbuilt (too heavy) or extremely light but far over-stressed for contained thin members. Past structures trending toward shallow triangles, double-triangles, or short diagonals, but stress ratios climb sharply (<mass constraints achieved only with disastrous overstress). Current member areas (mostly \'4\'=3.128), and triangle/box arrangements, offer stability but ruin mass. Two main factors increase mass: (1) over-use of thick member areas, (2) unnecessary interior members. Yet stress distribution generally is safe and low — mass is vastly oversized for everyone\'s needs. Additionally, no isolated nodes: connectivity okay throughout.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Stress: Almost all historic over-mass structures are far too conservative and do not leverage the upper limit of allowed stress, contributing to needless weight. Under-mass designs show spiking stress and fail that constraint. There\'s a need to (a) minimize area everywhere except essential compression/tension elements, (b) rationalize diagonal/bracing member areas per load, (c) position \'apex\' nodes to shorten verticals — high y-coords exponentially worsen member length/mass per area. Optimum should be compact, triangulated, minimal-diagonal linkage, using close to the largest allowable stress.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign with a stripped-down, minimum-mass triangular truss: allocate just enough area (prefer areas \'1\', \'2\' or minimal \'3\') in each member sited according to force path analysis. Maintain node_3 at original loaded x=2.0, y=0 (cannot adjust supports). Introduce two \'apex\' nodes for two tightly-angled triangles above the base (primary load resistance is vertical—respond forcefully along diagonals); these should be placed low, increasing resistance to vertical force while minimizing weight penalty.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Use a double-triangle arrangement, placing apex nodes near loaded/roller supports and centroid: one centrally above support span, slightly offset from node_3, and the second between nodes_4 (mid-span) and node_2 (right support). Primary members (bottom chord) run node_1–node_3–node_4–node_2. Shortest correspondence triangle apex, e.g. node_5 and node_6, will connect to nodes_1/3/4/2, respectively, closing the top flange. All nodes attached, containing no isolated points. Most member areas can be \'1\' or \'2\' (especially for diagonals) — only use \'3\' where principal compressed/tensioned (long chords).",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Member layout designed for effective force redistribution under off-center vertical/horizontal loads. Use symmetry left-right for efficient countering, triangles to transform varietal load at node_3 to in-plane axial member forces. For area assignment: Assign lower areas to diagonals, minimize apex y-coords (e.g., y~0.90–1.0), estimate each member length for input to mass calc: mass = Σ (length * area_value). Target main compressed members for area=\'2\' (0.782), less critical bracing/diagonal for area=\'1\' (0.195). Primary load path is node_3 into diagonals, supported vertically+axially by the triangles. Constraints calculated: Try likely lowest-mass design, each member force below max dragging stress/area for safety. Estimated max member force ~ (√15²+30²) = ~33.54kN, split across diagonals and chords within combined member capacity (generously below what thickest member in area=\'2\' can manage). Try initial apex at y=0.95. Yields relatively short verticals/diagonals, tightly contained mass.",\n\n    "calculation": "Bottom chord: node_1 (0,0) — node_3 (2,0) — node_4 (4,0) — node_2 (6,0). Node_5 (apex) = (2.8, 0.95). Node_6 (right apex) = (4.5, 0.87). Members: node_1–node_3 (2.00m), node_3–node_4 (2.00m), node_4–node_2 (2.00m), node_1–node_5 (≈3.00m), node_3–node_5 (≈0.94m), node_4–node_6 (≈0.93m), node_5–node_6 (≈1.75m), node_3–node_4 (2.00m), node_2–node_6 (≈2.71m). Principal chords use area=\'2\', major diagonals apex-to-chord use \'1\'/\'2\'. Total approximate mass calculation: For 8–9 members avg 2m × area (\'2\': 0.782) ≈ (8x2x0.782)=~12.5 < 30. Add buffer, totals under 20–22. Stress: If stress spread roughly over three/four loaded member combinations, each sees ~11–16kN (safe with \'2\':1kN/m² area), stress/mass ratio 0.4–0.5 (well within <0.5).",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Connect all supports and loads. Confirm all nodes are part of triangulated structure. Check total mass estimation holds with target — member areas may be tuned up for those carrying principal load if needed but must constrain the maximum used area_id per member. Double-check all area_ids in {\'0\', ..., \'10\'} and precisely float node entries. Maintain instruction: don’t touch node_1/2/3+load/support status.
