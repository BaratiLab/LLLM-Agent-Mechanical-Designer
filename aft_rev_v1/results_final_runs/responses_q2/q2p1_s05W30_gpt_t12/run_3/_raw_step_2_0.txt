The current design reflects significant overstress even with lightweight sections. This task aims to produce an optimal, constraint-satisfying closed truss maintaining node and support specifications.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Start by extracting applied loads, support constraints, node locations, member layouts, and AE/rule-constrained section assignments. No supports or loaded-node positions may change. Both past and current structures exceed the stress-to-weight constraint by large margins, pointing to inadequate geometric and topological layout rather than overspecification of member sizes.",\n\n    "analysis": "Loads: Node_3 subjected to (-15, -30) forces; supports: node_1 pinned, nodes 2 & 3 rollers—all on y=0 base. Historic and current trusses send high compression/tension down almost-horizontal links, resulting in overstress per unit truss weight, hinting at direct and inefficient load paths (members oriented parallel or near-parallel to base; vertical projection minimized thus creating large forces). The history structure is a simple, enlarged triangle (nodes 1, 2, 3 & node_4 apex high), which massively increases weight for insufficient benefit. The subsequent, denser truss introduces mid-height nodes (node_5 and node_4), yet possibly aligns diagonals poorly for direct force balancing. Both suffer from overstress on primary load paths. Lightweight, high-stress trunks are the cause. Both designs undershoot area even for minimum area cross-sections. Admissible area_ids (see list) show discrete jumps in area values.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "The load acts sharply downward and to the left on node_3. Members nearly parallel to the horizontal or base have poor vertical force-carrying efficiency; vertical and efficiently inclined members (SMALLER lengths, CLOSER to vertical per truss typology) greatly reduce global forces. Geometry should likely shift nodes_4/5 upward, creating a high triangle with triangles below. \'Pratt\' or \'Howe\'-type configurations—vertical near-loaded node with diagonal tension web—greatly improve the force handling. Aim to relieve main bottom chord by raising efficient verticals/diagonals beneath loaded nodes. All nodes remain globally connected.",\n\n    "proposal": "A complete geometric and topological redesign. Elevate node(s) above current triangle base to \'catch\' vertical load, making force transfers far more vertical and minimizing member forces and thus mass. Place node_4 high above loaded node_3. Connect each support (node_1, node_2) both to this new node_4 and to node_3. Add bracing from base to raised node for lateral stability. Remove node_5 (or reposition), aim for a triangular/quadrilateral shape that transforms difficult bending/axial states into simple trusses and short members. All member cross-sections set to minimum allowable area_id (\'1\') or \'2\' only as required, since for target stress/mass ratio they should suffice due to improved layout.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Balanced triangulation ensures each node (especially loaded node_3) is immediately supported vertically—moving support upwards via node_4 above node_3 spreads out the force and shortens force paths. The geometry simulates a bridge truss, or cantilever next best: raises the node collecting the force, sends loads with minimal lever arm to base supports. Symmetry in diagonal bracing will provide in-plane stability and distributed loading paths, such that individual member force and thus stress is reduced dramatically, hitting the constraint.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume: node_3 is loaded, needs a near-straight vertical tie to top node_4 at (2, 3.0). Node_1 at (0, 0) and node_2 at (6, 0), fixed (cannot move supports), so aim for simple isosceles configuration so each side path from top to support is short. Triangles: node_1-node_4-node_3, node_3-node_4-node_2, base node_1-node_3-node_2. Calculate approximate member forces: worst-case full vertical component through node_3 to node_4, splitting horizontally outward through each base leg. Use min area sections—previous overstress was ~53 in member_1 for area_id \'1\' = 0.195. For ~60° diagonal, force ≈ load / sin(θ), θ ~ tan⁻¹(3/2) ≈ 56°, so vertical pickup is strong, reducing force in lower members.",\n\n    "calculation": "Restructure nodes:\\nnode_1: (0.00, 0.00), node_2: (6.00, 0.00), node_3: (2.00, 0.00) (do not change supports/load nodes).\\nSet node_4 directly above node_3 at (2.00, 3.00).\\nTriangulate: overall triangle/nodal web with bracing.
