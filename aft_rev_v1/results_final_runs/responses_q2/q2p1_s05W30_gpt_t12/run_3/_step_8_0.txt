    "preamble": "Given a 3-node (supported) truss system with loaded node and stress-to-weight and mass constraints, previous designs did not satisfy all constraints, notably the strict stress-to-weight ratio (≤0.5). Objective: deliver the minimal-mass truss meeting the stress and weight requirements, optimizing geometry and connectivity, while not altering prescribed loads/supports.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs include node supports (pinned/rollers at nodes 1, 2, 3), node_3 loaded, viapoints at [0,0], [6,0], [2,0]. History shows that stress-to-weight constraint is repeated failing; highest prior score under 0.51 but all above 0.5. Suggests critical members are too highly loaded for chosen areas, geometry not dispersing force well enough.",
    
    "analysis": "Current and prior structures triangulate above the base, but max(abs(stress))/total_weight often approaches/just exceeds 0.5. Most stress sits in base chords connecting node_1/3 and 3/2, and in vertical or near-vertical posts from node_3 (load). Attempts to reduce member area to save mass push stress beyond limits; attempts to bulky up drop weight, but ratio gets close due to inefficient geometry: moment arms small, vertical posts inefficiently share loads. Members connecting above load point (node_3) have been insufficient to disperse downward forces due to their short lever arms or alignment.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Constraint failures stem from (a) members connecting to node_3 too directly and short spans above (poor force spreading) or under-bracing. Best designs are lightweight and closes triangles above node_3 while sharing loading between supports (nodes 1, 2). System wants strong midpoint bracing and long diagonal inclusions; solution likely involves increasing clear triangles in upper structure for improved force transfer.",
    
    "proposal": "Redesign geometry: slightly elevate central and upper nodes to maximize triangulation over the whole span, place two new upper nodes over midspan/quarter points higher than previous, close all triangles (including a top chord), but keep all supports and loaded nodes fixed. Assign optimized areas, employing larger at supports and load, thinner at upper braces.",
    
    "reasoning": "Symmetric, double-triangle Pratt/N configuration disperses force from node_3 efficiently through long diagonals and a continuous top chord. By elevating bracing above both node_1→node_2 and adding a top (central) node, more load allocates to compression diagonals decreasing extremes in individual member stress. Top connection also shortens vertical and diagonal elements, decreasing member force for a fixed vertical component at node_3. Assign larger section near base (maximum force), smaller at upper chord and diagonals. This distributes axial force more smoothly, limiting stress on the most crucial elements.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume: Steel, uniform density (weight ∝ area × length). Only use provided section types. Place two upper nodes at (1.75,2.0) and (4.25,2.0), top mid node at (3.00,2.8), all forming a closed, triangulated geometry. Key members to size-up: node_3-to-nodes_1,2; bottom chords. Smaller area for top and diagonals—targeting force balance with max(abs(stress))/total_mass ≤ 0.5. Use conservative estimates for area matching, opt for area '2' for highly loaded members (as prior failures at '2'); for heavily stressed midspan vertical, use '3' or '4'. Diagonal/top (lower loaded) may use '1' or '2'. Conservative selection as failure paralleled exceeding 0.5 even with area '2'.",
    
    "calculation": "Calculate: For bottom chords (node_1 to node_3, node_3 to node_2), length: 2m, 4m resp., use area '2' (0.782); diagonals base to upper nodes estimated 2.7–3.0m at area '1' (load spread basis); verticals (node_3 to top node) get '3'; top chord connect at '2'. Total member mass anticipated as ≤16.0 (with conservative areas). For maximal stress, summing moments and force balance gives maximal member force in vertical is (Apprx):|F| ≤ 9~10 at load (vertical) and <6 in diagonals; stress with chosen areas (FP) keeps within constraint (approximate, assuming distribution). Mass computation as: Σ(length × area); for all chosen members, sum is within bounds for area choice. Reiterate if individual stress fails est. values via area increment.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Recheck final geometry for full closure (no open triangles), assign only used area_ids, ensure members connect all nodes without isolation. Confirm none with areas below historical point of failure (was '2'). Recalculate all member mass = length × area (from dict). Confirm expected (max(abs(stress)) / total_weight) < 0.5 by reasoned area choices and load sharing over longer diagonals and posts. Confirm all supports/loads unaltered, no isolated nodes, and total_mass < 30. Geometry is regular, use precise floats for all node coordinates.",
