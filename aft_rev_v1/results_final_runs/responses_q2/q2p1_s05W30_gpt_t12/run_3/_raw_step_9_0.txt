Recent designs, while light and well-formed, have stress-to-weight ratios above the imposed limit (≤\u202f0.5). The objective is to generate a minimal mass, triangulated structure achieving this ratio and maintaining total mass ≤\u202f30, while adhering to precise support and load locations.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Heart of the task: minimize stress-to-weight ratio and mass for main span truss spanning 6\u202fm, support/layout fixed at left/right ends and load node. Several candidate designs in history narrowly fail stress-to-weight, so very high efficiency is needed—likely leveraging layout-centric optimizations and careful assignment of larger cross-sectional areas for only maximally-stressed members.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The supports are at (0,\u202f0) and (6,\u202f0) with pinned and roller (per boundary condition), with the load fully defined at (2,\u202f0), also a roller support. Existing triangulations add central elevation, with secondary nodes for triangulation. The main shortfall of each historic and current option is the max stress or stress-to-weight ratio (max seen: 0.5–2), all slightly over the allowed 0.5. Most solutions place non-essential material in low-stress upper chords, which could be reallocated.\\n\\nNotably, current best (max_stress_to_weight_ratio ≈ 0.9057) triangled the span in two with three upper panel points; moved the apex but kept symmetric triangles. However, a key theme: Maximum stresses almost always appear in lower main horizontal members. These could take added area, while upright and some diagonal elements could use minimal feasible area.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Previously, apex layouts not deeply increased the number of panels—most designs stay with a single/two-bay geometry. Judicious assignment of cross-sectional area, using the highest viable section in maximum-tension/compression members, and reducing area elsewhere, is recommended. Given recent stress calculations, further reduce stress by lowering height-to-span slightly and appropriately distributing panel points. Alternatively, increasing the number of segments (panel points on the top and bottom chords) while keeping slender, triangulated webs, should help.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign with more regular subdivision: keep pinned and both roller nodes in same spots with the load untouched, extend a top chord with two extra panel points equidistant from the ends and link them with diagonals for robust triangular action. Main bottom chord (from node_1→node_2, via node_3) gets largest area. Side/top chords and webs use smallest possible areas. Full connectivity is ensured: closed truss formed via bottom/top chords and diagonal bracing.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A Pratt form is considered optimal, for asymmetric point load close to a support (essentially two bays, loaded at node_3). To further reduce stresses and create efficient length-to-depth ratios, additional top nodes increase vertical depth to add triangles—spreading load and lowering force in main chords, distributing them into more web members. Members in tension/compression mapped via force analysis, maximally compressed/tensioned members armed with area \'4\', less loaded ties with \'1\' or \'0\'. Any possible chain from a before for-overstressed element will get slightly boosted area. Geometry is arranged to ensure efficient load sharing.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume: steel, moderate area values reflect degrees of (tension/compression) force. Set areas onboard (from history): bottom chord high stress, assign \'4\' (A=3.128) or largest needed. Top chord: minimal, \'1\' (A=0.195) or \'2\' (A=0.782) for web and uncompressed horizontal ties; verticals equivalent, set \'1\' through outer ones where only load transfer; diagonals \'2\' or \'3\' depending on length (short diagonal tends less stressed). Triangulate to form two top chords: each at 2\u202fm above nodes 1 and 2, with quarters at (1.5,\u202f2.0) and (4.5,\u202f2.0) for depth-to-span ~1:3 ratio.
