The goal is a closed, fully triangulated design with minimized stress-to-weight ratio (≤ 0.5) and total mass (≤ 30), while fully satisfying all input load and support conditions. Past designs fail due to insufficient triangulation, member sizing, or geometry inadequacy under load.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives: Satisfy load at node_3, maintain required support configuration at nodes 1, 2, and 3. Constraints: stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 0.5, total mass ≤ 30. Failure patterns: excessive stress in primary chord members and heavy total mass in thick truss designs.",\n    \n    "analysis": \n        "Current iterations overload chordal tension/compression members (especially between node_1 - node_3), exceeding ratio constraints, while historic heavy/overbuilt frames compromise on mass or stress. The simple four-node (diamond/prism) designs either lack secondary bracing, or have weak triangulation (force path degenerates through just a couple elements at high stress). More finely triangulated, symmetric forms distribute force with more redundant, less stressed members across increased area -- decreasing the max(abs(stress))/total_weight ratio. Furthermore, members connecting only lower nodes (forming unbraced frames) induce local overloads, explaining the high stress-to-mass ratio.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": \n        "Stable, closed, and triangulated shapes such as the double triangle or trapezium importantly help distribute loads and reduce peak stresses; add verticals or diagonals at critical path. Every loaded/support-bearing node must be a truss node, linked both via chord and diagonal. System gain: keeping overall bar areas moderate (selecting area_id=2/3/4/1 as balance of mass and strength) and spreading load over diagonal and vertical splits.",\n    \n    "proposal":\n        "Redesign: Use a five-node layout to maximize triangulation for load spread. Add node_5 elevated above midspan between node_1 and node_2. Member layout: Tie all free/load-bearing nodes into the structure via both diagonal and verticals forming a full truss web. Maintain existing positions for nodes with prescribed load/support and redesign the triangle apex (node_4) higher and adjust node_5 near the opposite support, closing triangles for full redundance.",\n    \n    "reasoning": \n        "With the asymmetric left/right support and the load at node_3, shifting node_4 (vertical apex) above node_3 and adding an \'anti-symmetric\' node_5 between node_2/node_3 at elevated y helps triangulate the load distribution and minimize stress concentration on the main chords. Cross diagonals (node_1↔node_4, node_2↔node_5, etc.) improve resistance to buckling and balance internal force paths.
