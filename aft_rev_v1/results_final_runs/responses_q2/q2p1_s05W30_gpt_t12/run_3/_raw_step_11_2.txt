The previous and historic structures violated these constraints, especially under maximum member stresses along the main span; an optimal solution is required.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "<<Interpretation>> Primary design: Three supports (one pinned, two roller), single load on node_3, several candidate topologies previously violated max stress-to-weight, either by failing triangulation (thus overloading a member) or heavy reliance on oversized members. Node and member efficiency and global stability must be improved.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current and historic trusses keep stress-to-weight \\u2265 0.655, noticeably failing the \\u2264 0.5 constraint. Main problems observed: (1) overload of main span/cantiliever members despite increasing area (which inflates mass), (2) insufficient alternative load paths for the load at node_3, (3) design lacks efficient triangulation beyond mid-span. Supports and key geometry are constrained at (0,0), (2,0), (6,0); only other nodes were moved or added freely in failed trials. Closed (fully triangulated) forms perform best for distributed force/resilience. The load at node_3 ideally should share more path options, so more triangles/support nodes above and beside the line between (0,0) and (6,0) might be leveraged. Past high-mass solutions (e.g. historic constraint_not_met_1) actually perform better in stress/channeling but fail on excess mass due to many thick members.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Observation: Redundant or over-thick members push mass over limits; lines of unbraced members concentrate stress. Bridges/closed trusses in which load nodes connect into triangles above the chord are more resilient and achieve distributed stress. Compact mid-span supports using short diagonal members and using moderate area sizes may yield best balance.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign for a Warren-style truss: (a) Maintain support/load nodes at fixed positions. (b) Add an upper cord with two intermediate nodes to form two top chords, making a triangular web pattern. (c) Triangulate between these via short inclined members rather than heavy verticals. (d) Use moderate member cross-sections. New nodes at (1.5,2.0) and (4.5,2.0), connecting to (2.0,0.0) and (6.0,0.0) and (0.0,0.0), close the truss. All loads, supports remain as prescribed.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Warren trusses create equilateral or near-equilateral triangles, efficiently splitting shear/bending into pairwise tension/compression. By maximizing triangular loops and avoiding heavy verticals (where load is pure shear), the load at node_3 can branch both left and right then up, equalizing member forces, substantially reducing maximum stress per given weight. Topology connects all nodes via at least two closed loops, preventing overloading and providing redundancy.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Load is shared among the bottom chord (node_1:0,0)-node_3(2,0)-node_2(6,0), crowded at node_3. Adding nodes node_4(1.5,2.0) and node_5(4.5,2.0). Chord and diagonal members sized to area_id \'2\' (A=0.782), except main inclined spans may take area_id \'3\' (A=1.759) for stress reductions if needed. Force estimation: the (node_3, node_4) and (node_3, node_5) will bear most load branching upward and split force; global max stress modeled as load/(sum inclination x sectional_area) < stress constraints; mass sum of members below 30.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member list: \\n- Bottom chord: (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2)\\n- Top chord: (node_4-node_5)\\n- Vertical/diagonal: (node_1-node_4), (node_3-node_4), (node_3-node_5), (node_2-node_5), (node_4-node_3), (node_5-node_3).
