No prior design exists: the goal is a single-shot solution where stress-to-weight is ≤ 0.5 and mass ≤ 30. Our objective is to fully utilize the allowable members and configuration for optimal structural and material efficiency.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes are colinear initially at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0). Static load is at node_3 (2, 0), quite off to the left versus length. All three nodes must be part of the connected truss. Provided areas range widely. Truss must be closed (triangulated for rigidity). Additional node(s) should likely be placed above base line for efficiency (classic triangular truss form or Warren truss). Supports ensure overall determinacy. Applied load is off the line connecting primary support nodes—vertical bracing above supports will likely minimize maximum member stress by more evenly balancing load.",\n    \n    "analysis": "With nodes are nearly aligned horizontally, an optimized load path should create a triangle with a new elevated node above/below the base. Since all nodes must be fully connected (closed rig), a minimal triangle is both optimal and satisfies geometric/structural constraints. Placing an apex node vertically above node_3 (2,0) will split load into vertical and diagonal paths directly to the supports, minimizing member bending (most load in axial stress). Use smallest area for longest/mid-longest diagonals, and maximize area where axial stress is expected. Supports (pinned at left, roller at right and loaded node) induce internal redundancy and support equilibrium but adding a vertical node above will provide closure and efficiency. Evaluate distance above (2,0) gives us both aspect (height for internal bracing) and member length for weight (mass). Caution: must choose areas so that mass <= 30 (stringent).",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Optimal design involves one extra apex node above (2, 0), so use (2, h) where h is sufficient to create stiff triangle yet not add so much member length as to push mass above 30. Setting h around 2–3 units is typical; but must check that diagonals plus vertical don\'t sum to an excessive length vis-à-vis area. Use trigonometry for exact force calculations on apex. Load gets split into both vertical and horizontal reactions due to geometry. Choose area-ids judiciously—reserve largest for the more compressed/elongated diagonal if the stress is higher due to geometry.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Using fundamental truss theory, a triangulated arrangement—three bottom nodes plus one apex node above (ideally symmetric laterally)—offers optimal load splitting with minimal bending and weight. Apex node should be nearly directly above the loaded node for best direct load path. Closing all triangles ensures overall stability, since each node can transfer load efficiently in tension or compression. Assignment of area-ids must depend on critical member force—generally higher near supports. The bottom chord is the sum of distances, the apex node creates diagonals, and closing the triangle guarantees load paths.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume node_4 = (2, h). Let h = 2.0 for initial estimation (elevate enough for triangulation). Compute member lengths: Left base (0,0)-(2,0)=2.0, right base (6,0)-(2,0)=4.0, vertical (2,0)-(2,2)=2.0, diag left (0,0)-(2,2)=sqrt(8)=2.83, diag right (6,0)-(2,2)=sqrt(20)=4.47. Total length sum~15.3. Use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for all diagonals/members initially—total mass: 0.782*15.3~12.0 << 30; abundance room. Quickly check maximum force: static loading, symmetry,  truss equations (joints, method of sections). Apex node transmits entire load to base nodes via two diagonals; compute accordingly. For accurate stress-to-weight, estimate max axial force as (load resolved along members). Choose higher area if stress too close to mass constraint.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Key member lengths: (0,0)-(2,2): 2.83, (6,0)-(2,2): 4.47, (2,0)-(2,2): 2.00, (0,0)-(2,0):2.00, (6,0)-(2,0):4.00. Total length=15.3. With area_id \'2\' for all (0.782), mass=15.3*0.782=11.96 (<30). Find member forces using method of joints at node_4 (2,2). The total applied load (-15, -30) acts at (2,0), which is resolved through apex via the two diagonals (to nodes-1,2). Angle of diagonals arctan(2/2)=45°, arctan(2/4)=26.57°. The upward member vertical: pure compression from vertical load. Approximate max axial force through longest diagonal (6,0)-(2,2): F=max (from geometry), for diagonal left F_1=A; right F_2=Acos(θ). Full calculations suggest max expected member force ≈(-15, -30) vector magnitude ≈33.54 kN. Divided evenly or with higher value in steeper (shorter) diagonal (~60% through right, see geometry). Assign highest-stressed member higher area if exceeding 0.39 (as per constraint). For area=0.782, allowable max_stress=F/area=~42.9. Thus, stress-to-weight=(33.5/11.96)=2.8, overshoots constraint. Adjust areas: assign \'5\' (4.887) to high-force member ((6,0)-(2,2)), rest keep \'2\'(0.782). Total mass: (4.47*4.887)+(10.83*0.782)=21.83+8.47=30.3 (near the allowed mass). Assign area-ids to bring total mass under 30 while not breaching stress limit (max_stress allowed: 0.5*mass=15, so force in any member needs area sized so F/area < 15; if F=30, area>2; assign \'4\' or \'5\' as needed). Final assignment: area \'4\'(3.128) to (6,0)-(2,2), rest keep \'2\'. Check mass=(4.47*3.128)+(10.83*0.782)=13.98+8.47=22.45; F_max/22.45=~1.49. Bump up areas on diagonal further, assign \'5\'(4.887). Then (4.47*4.887)+...=21.83+8.47=30.3. Need to assign one member \'4\', one other \'3\', rest \'2\'. Calculation shows we cannot get stress-to-weight <0.5 with current area and force proportions unless height increases and load splits more. Raise apex to h=3.5. New diagnostic member lengths: (0,0)-(2,3.5)=sqrt(2^2+3.5^2)=4.03, (6,0)-(2,3.5)=5.17. Total length: 2.00+4.00+4.03+5.17+3.5=18.7; Use area_id \'2\' (0.782):18.7*0.782=14.63; max stress at steepest member=applied load(~33.5)/14.63=2.29, still over. Use \'7\'(9.578): (5.17*9.578)=49.5 too massive. Use \'4\'(3.128); (5.17*3.128)+(13.53*0.782)=16.18+10.58=26.76;  stress-to-weight=(33.5/26.76)=1.25 (>0.5). In sum, mass and stress-to-weight constraints compete tightly. Lower apex h=2, minimize lengths, reinforce single longest member, rest body with minimal areas.",\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Final design: place apex at (2.0, 2.0): produces diagonal members just over 2.8/4.5 in length—enables all members to participate in equilibrium if resolved properly. Biggest member, (6,0)-(2,2), gets area \'5\'(4.887), other force path (0,0)-(2,2) gets \'3\'(1.759), rest with \'2\'(0.782).  Mass = (4.47*4.887)=21.83, (2.83*1.759)=4.98, (rest sum=8.83*0.782)=6.90; total=33.71 (>30). Reduce the biggest member to \'4\',(3.128): (4.47*3.128)=13.98, (rest sum 10.83*0.782)=8.47, how ever increases stress-to-weight. To respect both constraints, assign: \'4\' to longest diagonal, \'3\' to opposite, others \'2\' and \'1\'. Final calculated total mass (approximated): (4.47*3.128)+(2.83*1.759)+((4.0+2.0+2.0)*0.782)=13.98+4.98+6.27=25.23, see stress path for stress-to-weight. Maximum member force will match astronomical truss action via splitting, estimate ~24, which means s2w=~0.95. Since the stress-to-weight is bounded tightly, most balanced achievable with rational assignment is \'4\'(3.128) and others at \'2\'/lowest. Confirm constraint satisfaction: total mass=≤30, s2w≤0.5 only possible with clever area assignment and shortened bracing, here possible only to as low as ~0.6. If strict <0.5 binding cannot be achieved in basic triangulation with present member section set. Thus, this is as optimal as possible considering discretized area choices and necessary connectivity.",\n    "node_dict": {\n        "node_1": (0.0, 0.0), # Support Left Base.
