    "preamble": "The objective is to design a fully-connected, closed 2D truss spanning three supplied nodes, configured as one pinned + two roller supports. The only applied load is a moderate off-axis force at the mid-node. The optimization target is to minimize the max(abs(stress))/total_weight ratio, with strict limits on stress-to-weight (< 0.5) and total mass (< 30 units), and to produce a formally-closed (no gaps) truss. Strategic use of minimal triangulation and direct load transfer is required to satisfy requirements with lowest member areas/practical mass.",

    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs: Nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0). All are at y=0, so currently colinear, non-triangulable. Roller supports at both ends of span and load in negative x and y at (2,0) make for an unstable line if left as is. Extra node(s) are likely needed out-of-plane to enable triangulation. Objective: tight, closed shape; optimal load paths.",

    "analysis": "With all nodes on y=0, three-bar simple trusses aren't possible (would be one straight line, providing no stability against applied vertical force). To generate closure and provide stability, at least one apex node is needed above support line. The load at (2,0) is best resisted by forming two triangles: one on the left (nodes 1-3-4) and one on the right (nodes 2-3-4), with new node_4 (apex node) at (2,2.4). This configuration forms a rigid, closed triangular truss distributing load efficiently between supports. Members needed: (node_1-node_3), (node_1-node_4), (node_3-node_4), (node_2-node_3), (node_2-node_4). This resists the downward and rightward load well and avoids long, highly-stressed members. Member areas should be minimal but sufficient for stress constraints; all area IDs will be set by explicit calculation.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulated basic span via a fourth node helps minimize member forces and creates enough redundancy to balance under both orthogonal and angled loads. Aim to keep apex (node_4) vertically above node_3 for symmetry. Diagonal orientation fixes vertical instability present if using baseline (no added node) approach.",

    "reasoning": "An apex above node_3 gives two equivalent load paths, which divides stress and enables a minimal, distributive solution. To avoid excess mass, node_4 should be as low as possible while ensuring geometry has acceptable member lengths (to resist buckling and reduce member load). Quantify member lengths based on optimized height h=2.4 for good force bascule: (node_4)=(2.0,2.4) (determined to keep member stresses balanced). Assume area_id for the two most critical diagonals connecting node_4 to nodes 1 and 2 should be somewhat larger, others can be minimal.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: area_vec from keys is used for all members. Area_id assignment is as follows: assign largest forces (main diagonals) to area_id '3' (=1.759), horizontals + top (node_3–node_4) to area_id '1' (=0.195).  \
\
    Calculations:\
    (1) Member lengths via sqrt((dx)^2 + (dy)^2).\
    (2) Mass = sum(length × area):\
        L13: 2.0m, A=0.195;\
        L14: sqrt(4+5.76)=3.04m, A=1.759;\
        L34: sqrt(0+5.76)=2.40m, A=0.195;\
        L23: 4.0m, A=0.195;\
        L24: sqrt(16+5.76)=4.52m, A=1.759;\
    (3) Estimate force in diagonals via projection (vertical load largely split across diagonals). Simplify:\
        Assume diagonals see majority:\
            θ = atan2(2.4,2.0) = 50.19°,\
            Main diagonal force per ½loadVertical/cosθ ≈  -15/2 = -7.5 / 0.641 = –11.7 kN per, for vertical.\
            Add horizontal via –15/2 = -7.5 / 0.641 similar, ≈ –11.7. Resultant ≈ 16.5kN per main diagonal.\
    (4) Stress = F/A, so for diagonals: σ = 16.5/1.759 ≈ 9.385;\
        For min area A=0.195 elements (F ≈ up to half due to load path splitting and geometry): max σ ≈ ~15-20 kN/0.195 = 76~90kN <limits exceeded! Thus set other areas to '2' (=0.782): Node 1–3, 2–3, 3–4.\
    Update mass calculation with new area IDs.",
