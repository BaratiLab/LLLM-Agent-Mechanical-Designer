Current design already satisfies constraints (ratio=0.34, mass=21), but objective is further minimization of stress-to-weight ratio while retaining or improving structural efficiency.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given: Loads must stay at node_3, supports at nodes 1, 2, and 3. All nodes must connect; current design is a moderate-weight prismatic truss with triangulation, satisfying all given constraints. Improvements should seek further stress-to-weight reduction while preserving geometry for predictable behavior.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Reviewing current and history: All historic alternates fail constraints (ratio>0.5). Current config is a closed, triangulated truss. The highest single member compression (-7.05) occurs in \'member_1\' (node_1–node_3), with oversized area usage. Several members (e.g., member_8, 9, 10) experience much lighter forces and likely oversize, suggesting potential mass savings. Nodes with supports/loads must remain but node_4/5/6 positions could adjust. High area bars are only justified where force demands. Over the full weight, the primary inefficiency is slightly oversizing certain lightly-loaded diagonals and top bracing. Geometric layout triangulates well, but the top cord is long and nearly prismatic. Shifting node_4 and node_6 slightly closer to load reduces member length and rebalances force flow from top/bottom chords, potentially lowering peak stress and mass. Should preserve or improve triangulation. Use area \'2\' on low-stress ties, create a more compact top for better load flow.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Critical pattern: Most stress localized in lower chord (member_1, node_1 to node_3) and major links to load node_3. Some top and side members likely oversized for their tensions. Bringing node_4 and node_6 inward and up modestly will shorten the highest-weight links and reduce peak local force. Reevaluate smallest allowed section for all compression/tension ties under 1.5 stress magnitude.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Keep support and load nodes fixed to maintain constraints and consistent load path. Slightly move node_4 and node_6 higher and inward (~0.2–0.4u) for improved structural depth under load path. Downsize area in less-stressed ties and chords, except those with stress over 3.0. Keep top triangular bay. Remove member_8 (much undersized; offers tiny benefit for cost), but increase member_7\'s area if required by rerouted stresses.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Geometry: Elevate the mid/transversal nodes modestly and inward for better depth and direct action to supports, reducing work in long members. Assign the smallest compatible section to low-force bars for weight savings. Structural principle: Heavily loaded bars keep area_3,  lightly loaded switch to area_1 or 2. Triangulation minimizes structural work. Connections ensure all nodes tied to primary structure. Avoid prismatic unbraced bays. Estimated reductions come from trapezoidal upper rearrangement and optimal area sizing, continued constraint satisfaction by keeping high area at member_1 only.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Equations/principles: Sum forces, analyze truss symmetry, focus stress reductions into areas that conserve mass. Update node_4 to (3.5,2.4), node_5 to (5.0,2.0), node_6 to (2.1,2.8); this shortens high-stressed and upper members slightly. Area assignments: strongest request (|stress|>3) area_3, otherwise area_2, lightest bars area_1. Recalculate key member lengths for new mass. Remove member_8 — very lightly stressed, offers little stiffness. Perform static analysis: rerun peak stress checks by load line. Estimate: peak stress remains below constraint, global mass drops slightly.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Update node_4: y from 2.0 to 2.4 (+0.4) and node_6: y from 2.6 to 2.8, x from 2.0 to 2.1, to steepen upper triangle slightly, leading to minor spanning and shorter diagonal paths. Approximate length adjustments for each member now yields: member_1 (|stress|~6.6), hold area_3; member_2 (still short, stress <1, area_2); member_6, member_7 absorbs removed bracing from member_8; stress rises to ~1.0, area_2; upper-link fiber members are comfortably below stress 1, can use area_1 or 2. Remove member_8. Total estimated mass: modest decrease (~20.3). Projected peak stress: similar. Recomputed stress:max_weight ratio: peak ~6.6/mass~20.3 = 0.325 (improvement). Area IDs set as before: {\'1\':0.195, \'2\': 0.782, \'3\': 1.759}. All constraints respected (ratio<0.5, mass<30). Update node positions as follows.",\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Confirm structural closure: all nodes connected, truss triangulated, no isolated. All constraints on mass and stress-to-weight met.
