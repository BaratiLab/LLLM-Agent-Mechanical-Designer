All supports are at y=0.0, with node_3 carrying a downward and leftward load of (-15, -30) N. Direct connection of all nodes produces a line, so an out-of-line (vertical) node is likely essential to triangulate and close the structure for stability and optimal force transmission. The solution must use valid member sizes to combine minimal mass and favorable force paths to reduce the maximum per-weight stress below 0.5, with all nodes structurally engaged.",\n    \n    "analysis": "All nodes are collinear, which is inherently unstable and does not provide a strictly closed (triangular/triangulated) structure. With the load at node_3 and both supports not co-located, only vertical/load transfer via triangulation is physically sensible. To close the truss, introduce an additional node (node_4) above the x-axis (on the y-direction, say y=2.5), positioned where it balances geometry and creates efficient load transfer via diagonal bracing. Within a total mass limit of 30, and area IDs as section presets, geometric efficiency and member sizing must prevent overstress (stress <= 0.5 × weight). Direct joint-to-support lines will be shortest and most force-efficient; side-triangulation will best handle the moment from eccentric load at node_3.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "An elevated node above the x-axis, connected appropriately, triangulates the configuration: main triangle node_1-node_2-node_4, with node_3 supported by diagonals to node_1, node_2, and the new node_4. Place node_4 around (3.0, 2.0) for symmetry. Member selection should follow force distribution: direct load-bearing diagonals assigned larger areas if needed, short closing members can use smaller areas. Re-express supports as pinned (node_1) and rollers (node_2, node_3) - thus the whole configuration is kinematically stable.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Place node_4 at (3.0, 2.0), equally above the x-axis, forming a robust triangle with node_1 and node_2 and tying in node_3 via short-strutting diagonals. Members: node_1-node_2, node_2-node_4, node_4-node_1 (main triangle), node_3 to node_1, node_2, node_4 (to bring the load directly to supports/triangulated mesh). All prescribed nodes are directly joined in cyclic fashion, with node_3\'s diagonals facilitating direct and redundant load paths. Assign minimum cross-sections to non-critical braces, moderate ones (0.782 to 1.759) to heavily loaded diagonals.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All truss connections frictionless/hperfect pins, all loads in member axial direction only (classic truss), each member receives only tension/compression. Estimate length using Euclidean distance. Forces: Use method of joints for force computation (sum Fx = sum Fy = 0 at each joint; reaction calculation at supports). Mass = total_length * area_value (from mapping provided). Max(abs(stress))/total_weight to be < 0.5. Truss members: 6 total, setting up geometry accordingly.",\n\n    "calculation": "Node locations: node_4 at (3.00, 2.00). Compute lengths: node_1-node_2 = 6.00, node_1-node_4 = sqrt((3-0)^2 + (2-0)^2)=3.606, node_2-node_4=same=3.606, node_1-node_3=2.00, node_2-node_3=4.00, node_3-node_4=sqrt((3-2)^2+(2-0)^2)=sqrt(1+4)=2.236. Area selection (area_dict): Major triangle (node_1-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4)=area_id \'2\' (0.782 per m²). Diagonals from capacity/symmetry: node_1-node_3=\'1\' (0.195), node_2-node_3=\'1\' (0.195), node_3-node_4=\'2\' (0.782) due to direct load. Total member masses: [6.00, 3.606, 3.606, 2.00, 4.00, 2.236] * [0.782, 0.782, 0.782, 0.195, 0.195, 0.782] = approx 4.692 + 2.823+2.823+0.390+0.780+1.748 = ~13.256 < 30. Estimate max member internal forces under the (-15, -30) load, splitting force accordingly between braces via static method of joints (worst case diagonal force sign, assuming shortest diagonal carries +/-30N/sin(angle)). Using smallest working area, stress = force/area, so max expected is ~30N/0.195 = ~154 (overestimate in absolute—so the diagonals should be slightly larger, select stronger for diagonals adjacent to the loaded node so none exceeds e.g. <15N/0.782 = 19.2). Main triangle and base assign 0.782 (area \'2\'); diagonals adjust to area \'2\' for stiffness. Recount: total mass = (6+3.606+3.606+2+4+2.236)*0.782=~17.2 < 30. Find total weight; max stress will be ~21N/0.782=~26. Adjust area IDs for loaded node_3 diagonals up to area \'3\'=1.759 for <15N/1.759=8.5, so mass increases by 2.00*(1.759-0.782)=1.954 (for node_3 to node_1 and node_3 to node_2) + (4-2)*0.977=1.954 = total still under mass limit.
