    "preamble": "This is a 2D truss optimization task. The current three-node truss connects two supports and a loaded node at (2.00, 0.00). The present design already attains a low stress-to-weight ratio (0.1509) and satisfies all constraints on stress and total mass. The goal is to further minimize stress-to-weight while ensuring the truss remains closed, connected, and respects all physical/geometric/constraint bounds. I will examine if geometric and topological improvements are feasible.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs specify three nodes laid flat on y=0; all with required boundary/inputs fixed via supports, including the loaded node. Mass constraint (<30) is loose. Each member stress and mass is given. Optimization is on-going at iteration 6/25; current best has greatly outperformed alternate geometric forms tried in past generations.",
        
    "analysis": "Structure: Standard triangular truss with pinned at node_1, roller at nodes 2 and 3. Loaded node is node_3, only able to slide (roller). The load (-15, -30)kN at node_3 rules out vertical displacement, i.e. node_3 is fixed on y=0. The design is essentially a right-triangle with members: (n1, n2), (n1, n3), (n2, n3). Member_3 (n2-n3) is much heavier than other members due to area selection (uses id=5 ≡ 4.887). Loads and supports essentially prevent node movements — y-values must remain 0 for all due to supports and load application. Mass (26.97) is not close to upper bound, so increasing area for reduced max stress is not useful: the stress-to-weight metric is already excellent (0.151, where constraint is ~0.5).\nPhysical topology (triangle) is the most efficient closed truss achievable with 3 points, and attempts to add more nodes (from structure history) produced either no benefit or violated constraints due to high stresses. Current node positions are locked by problem geometry (y=0 due to supports/loads+roller, x=0/2/6 entire span ~compressed to triangle already). All possible area/minor cross-sectional tweaks maintain or worsen the metric. No member duplication or removal is possible within closed, non-degenerate truss requirement with these pinned points.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Reviewing history: design with five nodes (generation rank_3) increased weight + stress-to-weight. Attempts at additional nodes push total mass within constraints but stress magnifies abnormally (iso-static limits, force redistribution with nontriangular nodes). Meanwhile, attempts to reduce member areas (see constraints_not_met_1) lead to drastic stress spikes (SWR > 0.8). Close connected triangle with current member assignments is near-minimal. The problem is essentially domain-closed: unless introducing more nodes drastically alters force paths (which history disproves), further improvement is unlikely.",
    
    "proposal": "Retain the current best design without changes because: (A) member arrangements and node positions cannot be further optimized without violating key constraints, and (B) history shows all attempts with different node layouts have led to substantial degradation of the stress-to-weight metric. The triangle truss connecting support/roller/loaded nodes is optimal given geometric fixity and stress-to-mass constraints. Thus, I propose preserving current node locations and member assignments, with design documentation for self-evidence. Set stop=True as no further feasible gains can be made.",
    
    "reasoning": "Classical truss theory states that for a fully constrained/bounded problem, the simplest, fully triangulated, shortest member structure delivers lowest possible stress for minimum weight, assuming adequate sections. Attempts to change geometry or reduce section size directly violate stress bounds, while expanding geometry/adding members increases mass and stress together—trading off against the objective ratio. Load/supported nodes on same line precludes alternate bracing or elevation (equilibrium prohibits vertical deviation for node_3/roller at node_2). Both placement and topology and singular member upgrades have proven optimal by tested alternatives (per history). No grounded or isolated vertices present, and all constraint checks hold.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions/tools: Node geometry and support arrangement prohibit y-axis adjustment (roller or loaded nodes can't move); members must form one closed triangle. Mass calculation (sum(lengths × area per member), provided), verified per code. Try considering member area fine-tuning: all attempt to cut area make SWR worse; all up-sizes increase mass. All previous topologies higher ranked are this structure or variants. No geometric or computational gaps.",
    
    "calculation": "Reiterate mass: (member_1: 1.17kg; member_2: 6.26kg; member_3: 19.55kg) = 26.974kg total < 30kg. Stress-to-weight ratio = max(|-4.0705|)/26.974 = 0.1509; both within bounds. No constraint violation. Placement of nodes locked; reinforcement or branching impossible within node-connection rules and current positions.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Checklist: All geometry, topology, and section selection constraints are hit optimally; major alternatives explored result in metric loss or constraint violations (history). Node/member configuration is proved closed, connected, efficient. Optimization is effectively concluded per instructions.",
    
    "stop": "True # Optimal design has been reached; all exhaustive, reasonable alternatives result in strictly worse objective values (from structure-history and analytical review). Further modification not productive without constraint violation.",
