The ultimate goal is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio (max(abs(stress))/total_weight), targeting less than 0.5, while keeping total mass <= 30 and ensuring structural closure. Currently, the best design achieves a 0.1509 ratio and meets all constraints, but analysis may unearth further improvement potential.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The truss currently adopts a triangular configuration using only the essential support and load nodes. Past attempts with more nodes/members quickly exceeded mass or stress-to-weight bounds. Areas and geometry appear dictated by minimum closure with smallest feasible cross-sections (area_id=1, 4, 5).",\n    \n    "analysis": "Triangular trusses are inherently efficient for simple spans and point loading, as seen in the current design. Looking at the FEM results and member forces, most force is borne by the \'node_1\'-\'node_3\' and \'node_1\'-\'node_2\' members, with highest stress in \'member_2\' connecting \'node_1\' to \'node_3\'. Member mass for \'member_3\' is highest (19.548) due to area selection. Increasing nodes in past structures increased total weight and max stresses, causing declining efficiency/loss of feasibility. Importantly, all constraint-satisfying historic designs are essentially identical.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The current structure is minimal – closed, all supports & loaded nodes active in triangles. No member, besides those carrying large force, is over- or under-sized for resultant load paths. Experiments with adding nodes have repeatedly increased mass or ineffective load arc routing, making stress distributions less balanced for point (and not distributed) loading. There may be room for minute gains refining member areas or positions. All design avenues for splitting or densifying nodes within the mass constraint have been exhausted.",\n    \n    "proposal": "The best approach is to slightly nudge node positions within geometric constraints to explore minute improvement in mass or stress by fine-pointing internal force angles. The area ids appear optimal given constraints: small for low-load, large for heavy-load members. However, as current best-so-far and all feasible historic solutions converge to the same topology and quantitative result, there is strong evidence this structure is locally optimal.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Optimal 2D trusses with fixed and two roller conditions, and a load applied coplanar with supports, favor sweeping all geometry into a closed triangle. Triangulation achieves closure with max stiffness, unavoidable for both boundary and mass constraints. Further optimization through new member introduction or alternate area distribution fails unless nodal reloading (infeasible here) is permitted. Teasing small gains in stress-weight ratio is possible only by adjusting node_3 (but this is fixed for load/roller), or minute area tweaks; we\'ve already assigned lowest possible logical area_s.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Sampled alternate triangles and reallocated areas within permissible range. Calculated mass = sum(length * area); stress scaled by force per unit area. All minute repositionings where allowed were either neutral or caused constraint violation (esp. mass or stress-to-weight), and non-inferior to current truss. Ensured connectedness: all nodes participate. Checked combinations from area_id set across members █ already tested in history/materials.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Current configuration: [0.0, 0.0], [6.0, 0.0], [2.0, 0.0] is the shortest-possible span and height with pinned and roller supports in line with a single loaded node. min area assignments yield total mass 26.974 with ratio 0.1509. Increasing or decreasing member areas or nudging node_3 off the base resulted in constraint violations (stress-to-weight too high, mass too high, or failed closure). Fem results for past variants confirm.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Constraints neatly met. Ratio below threshold and mass under 30. All nodes belong to closed triangle, no floating node, no over/under-reinforced member observed. Graph unchanged through consecutive best rankings.
