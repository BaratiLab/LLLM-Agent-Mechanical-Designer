    "preamble": "This problem seeks to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio of a closed 2D truss using three given nodes, specified supports, and a fixed load on node_3, while satisfying constraints on total mass (≤30) and stress/weight (≤0.5). Current structure forms a simple triangle with suboptimal member sizes. A more efficient mass allocation is demanded.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given triangle (nodes 1-2-3) is stable and statically determinate. Members are possibly oversized for their stress. Total mass 26.97 is close to the upper limit, so significant mass savings may not be possible; further improvement should target usage of lower area sections where stress is low.",
    
    "analysis": "Supports and load locations are fixed; supported at all three nodes (1: pinned, 2 & 3: roller), loaded at node_3 (Fx=-15, Fy=-30). Connections (1-2, 1-3, 2-3) form a minimal closed truss. Borderline feasible mass suggests that excess area selection is the last inefficiency. Historical evaluation (no prior, only current structure) reveals overdesign for some members, notably the colossal weight of member_3 (2–3; area_id 5, highest member_mass at 19.54 vs 6.25 and 1.17 for others), even though its force isn't extremely high (only 0.05 member_stress). Members 1 and 2 display much lower stresses (–1.32 and –4.07, member_2 carries the largest stress in compression). The overall structure shares load, but especially member_3 delivers almost no load compared to its size. Current stress/weight is comfortably low at 0.15; constraint is 0.5.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "Member_3 is a very large and under-stressed element; swapping to a lower area can massively decrease total mass. Member_2 is the most highly loaded, but still possible to decrease size slightly if needed. Member_1 is only moderately loaded. Slight area reductions across all—while not encroaching safety—would have significant impact. No extra diagonals/nodes to add (three nodes only). Only member sizing can be improved. Node placement likely needs no adjustment; all are support/fixed, geometrically minimal.",
    
    "proposal": "Keep node placements fixed (respecting loads/supports and closure) while strictly resizing members to closely match their respective stress demands (using next-lowest compliant area_id) for significant mass savings and much-improved stress-to-weight ratio. Reassign capital area to only those experiencing the highest stress; others optimized.",
    
    "reasoning": "In a minimal three-node closed truss, structural efficiency is maximized by closely matching each member’s required strength (from member_stress) to its area (from area_id). Given the gross oversizing of member_3 (~0 stress), select the minimal appropriate area (start from area_id '0'); for member_2 (largest |stress|), select area just sufficient for –4.07; for member_1, set near-minimal under constraints. This optimization lowers total mass and pushes stress/weight ratio lower, improving toward minimal values. Avoid any geometric change: all nodes are either supported or loaded, so movement provides no benefit.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Key assumptions: max member stress determines minimum area required. Use parsimony: for each member, required area = |force|/(σ_allow), picking min area_id from list s.t. allowable > |stress|. Given all member stresses (absolute), map to area_id:\n- For member_2 (max stress: 4.07): select smallest area_id >= expected stress = ‘2’ (0.782) as area_id values are for area, but stress can be determined from force/area. Here, areas could be matched by allowing same member stress within constraint (<actual_max>); select min necessary from area list for each member according to stress and validate by total mass.\n- For member_3 (~0.05 stress), select area_id '0'; length is same. For member_1 (–1.32), select area_id '1' (0.195), sufficient for its lower force.\nCalculate member lengths: 1–2 = 6.00m, 1–3 = 2.00m, 2–3 = 4.00m. Use area table for new member masses and total mass update to check constraints.",
    
    "calculation": "Member_1 (1–2): length 6.0m × area 0.195 ('1') = 1.17 \nMember_2 (1–3): 2.0m × 0.782 ('2') = 1.564\nMember_3 (2–3): 4.0m × 1.0 ('0') = 4.0\nTotal mass = 1.17 + 1.564 + 4.0 = 6.734\nMax stress: taken from member_2 (program assumes stress doesn’t change notably with small area upgrades in determinate truss; but if needed, up available area).\nStress/weight ratio re-evaluated:\nmax(|stress|) = 4.07\nStress/weight = 4.07/6.73 ≈ 0.605\nAbove constraint (0.5), indicating slight underdesign.\nIncrease member_2 to next standout area (‘3’:1.759):\nMember_2 mass: 2.0×1.759=3.518\nNew total: 1.17+3.518+4.0=8.688\nStress/weight:~0.468 (4.07/8.69) – within limit.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints finally satisfied – total mass: 8.69 (<30), max stress/weight: ~0.468 (<0.5), all boundary conditions/closure respected, no need to introduce geometric complexity or further area upgrades, design is boldly optimized, no extra nodes or redundancy possible.",
