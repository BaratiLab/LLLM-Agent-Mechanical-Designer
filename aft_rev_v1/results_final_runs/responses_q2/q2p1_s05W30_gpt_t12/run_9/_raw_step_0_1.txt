The main design goal is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio, ensuring the structure is closed, all stresses and mass remain within strict constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes are provided, making a truss triangle possible, but the geometry is highly unbalanced (nodes closely spaced along x-axis except node_3 at an intermediate value). Load is mainly on node_3 and is both downward and to the left. Supports are pinned at node_1, rollers at nodes 2 and 3. Constraints on both max stress/weight (<=0.5) and the overall mass (<=30) suggest the structure must be minimal and efficient.",\n    \n    "analysis": "To minimize stress-to-weight, the best approach is often a statically determinate triangular (minimum-member; fully triangulated) arrangement connecting all three nodes, directly linking load and support. The acute geometry (nodes colinear or near-colinear along x=0...6) means significant axial force will be induced in the base member and high diagonal in one of the sides. To ensure connectivity and minimize member length, a triangle is most efficient. Using the smallest necessary cross-sections for highly loaded members preserves lightness, but those with lowest axial forces can use the smallest area ID. The member between (0,0) and (2,0) will carry much of the load via transfer to node_1 (pinned). The constraint (max(abs(stress))/weight <= 0.5) is quite strong: members must have enough area to keep max stress low even if that increases mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Examination reveals structural redundancy cannot be added without breaking mass target, so a basic triangle is optimal. Node additions would worsen weight/stress ratio due to already sparse node layout. Maximizing shortest length connections helps mass during this dimensioning process.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Design will be minimal with (1) member_1 between node_1--node_2 (base), (2) member_2 between node_1--node_3 (load-to-support leg), (3) member_3 between node_2--node_3 (right diagonal), forming a triangle. Member cross-section areas will be distributed such that longest/highest-forced member gets largest needed area_id to ensure local stress remains below set ratio with weight, exploiting the finer area_id choices in the provided list.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths using coordinates:\\n - node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0):\\n 1. member_1 (node_1 to node_2): L = 6.00\\n 2. member_2 (node_1 to node_3): L = 2.00\\n 3. member_3 (node_2 to node_3): L = 4.00\\nSum of lengths = 12.00\\nExamine structural equilibrium: with supports at ends (one pinned, two rollers), the truss is determinate. Approximate significant member forces by resolving the -15kN horizontal and -30kN vertical at node_3 transmitted through these members (joint equilibrium). Members 2 and 3 will carry high force; member_1 will mostly be in compression. Assign area IDs to ensure no stress exceeds permissible value while keeping weight low (try area_id \'5\' (A=4.887) for most-loaded, \'2\'/\'1\' (A=0.782/0.195) for lesser).\\nTotal weight = sum(L_i * A_i).

The load forms a right triangle (-15,-30) at node_3.
