    "preamble": "The design problem is a planar 2D truss spanning nodes at ground (three supports) subjected to a concentrated load at node_3. The truss must minimize max(abs(stress))/total_weight, stay below total mass = 30, and be fully connected, closed, and constraint-satisfying. The optimal design should improve upon the given structure (ratio 0.252), considering historical optimals.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: minimize the stress-to-weight ratio with strict mass and topology constraints. The ground structure and loading are defined, supporting different ready-made bar areas. Current design is constraint-satisfying but improvements were previously achieved with a simpler layout (rank_1: ratio 0.1509, mass 26.97).",
    
    "analysis": "The current structure (7 members, 5 nodes—2 upper for triangulation, 3 along the base) gives a ratio of 0.252, with clear support (two rollers, one pinned) and a downward/leftward load at node_3. Comparing with structure history, the 3-member straight truss (rank_1) is efficient but has less redundancy. The historical optimum employs the same base nodes as supports/loads and two diagonal elements, structurally optimal for such configurations—the diagonals form two triangles with the base. The current truss’s additional inclined members contribute to higher mass and may not promote more effective force transfer per mass than the highly optimized triangle.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Simpler, heavily triangulated configurations show better ratios under identical support and load scenarios. Five nodes and excess members tend to overcomplicate and add bulk where direct force transfer via strong triangles suffices. Risk: minimal topology could be less robust, but per constraint, redundancy isn’t prioritised.",
    
    "proposal": "Given performance of historic optimal (rank_1), I propose returning to the triangle-based form, carefully sizing areas to handle deduced stresses for minimum total mass within our constraints. Ensure three connected nodes (all supports/loads), form two triangles; since all nodes with loads/supports must stay, avoid moving their positions. This leverages best closed, constraint-satisfying topology for minimal stress-to-weight ratio.",
    
    "reasoning": "Principal: Direct load path, minimal length, maximal triangulation for force transfer. Set up connections: full base (node_1 to node_2), then node_3 as apex joining node_1 and node_2, forming a strong direct triangle. Hypotenuse edge (node_1-node_3) and (node_2-node_3) intercept and efficiently balance applied load. Sizing: choose area_ids based empirically and by back-calculation from forces and masses in rank_1 solution. Further modification via node placement relaxation would yield only minimal gain, as nodes with loads/supports cannot be repositioned—current locations are optimal.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume coord precision to 1e-2: nodes remain at [0.0, 0.0], [2.0, 0.0], [6.0, 0.0]. Examining ranking_1, mass is 26.97, ratio 0.1509. Assign area_id = '1' (0.195) to base (to take mainly compression), area_id = '4' (3.128) to node_1-node_3, and '5' (4.887) to node_2-node_3, matching the best historical mass-per-stress efficiency.",
    
    "calculation": "Members: 1. node_1-node_2 (length = 6.0, area_id = '1', mass = 1.17 as proven by the previous run); 2. node_1-node_3 (length = 2.0, area_id = '4', mass = 6.256); 3. node_2-node_3 (length = 4.0, area_id = '5', mass = 19.548). Mass sum is 26.974 as rank_1. Stresses (from prev. history): -1.3217, -4.0705, 0.0527, so max(abs(stress)) = 4.07 and ratio = 4.07/26.974 = 0.1509 < 0.5 constraint and total mass well under 30.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Constraint verified: both max(abs(stress))/weight and total mass < 30. Structure is fully triangulated, all nodes connected, all nodes with loads/supports used. Most historical design—recognized (rank_1) as optimal—prevails for stress-weight minimization.",
    
    "stop": "True # Stopping here because further structural simplification would violate constraints or diminish robustness. Historical data and mechanics confirm triangle to be optimal for chosen load-support situation. Further iterations unlikely to yield meaningful improvement.",
