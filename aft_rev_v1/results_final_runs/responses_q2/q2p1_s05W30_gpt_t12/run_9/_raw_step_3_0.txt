Previous designs either exceeded the stress-to-weight ratio constraint (≤ 0.5) or had unnecessary total mass. The goal is a minimized and constraint-satisfying configuration, maintaining crucial load and support positions.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Begin with support/load locations and examine where previous trusses concentrate high stress or use excess material (mass). Triangulated, efficient connections should be sought, calibrating member area for structural demand.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The pinned support at node_1 and rollers at node_2, node_3 render a statically determinate boundary. The combined force at node_3 (-15.0, -30.0) requires clear, direct load paths to supports. Existing history shows: (i) prior structures were overweight (good constraint compliance but high stress-to-weight ratio), (ii) trying intermediates to reduce area pushed some members (esp. node_1 <-> node_3) beyond stress limits, likely due to insufficient direct capacity from node_3 to supports and low triangulation. The node_4 elevation at (2,2.5) in the last attempt enabled bracing but did not fully relieve high tension in the base (node_1 to node_3), so stress still violated constraints.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Mass drops mainly from using lower-area IDs on lightly loaded members and reducing overall length (tight truss envelopes). Stress drops occur when load paths are more direct and mediated by short well-angled members—small truss heights in span directions hurt this. Stress at member_4 (node_1 to node_3 axis) exploded: indicates node_3 to support load isn\'t well handed off via triangulation. Moderate out-of-plane elevation or auxiliary nodes along load path appear necessary.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Keep supports and loaded node fixed. Move node_4 slightly higher, and add a new fifth node (node_5) above and rightward of node_3, making a stiffer \'open k-truss\' shape. This improves geometric triangulation and offers direct load paths both horizontally and vertically to both supports. Only connect efficient, shortest diagonal brace members. Use reduced area IDs except for areas with maximally concentrated load (node_3, node_5 and crossing diagonals).",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A \'kite-shaped\' configuration staggers the vertical load through node_5, above node_3. Resulting diagonals split the load into manageable chunks, with more balanced compressive/tensile stress across members. This solution spreads force from node_3 toward both supports without running high force through a single member as in previous (failed) low-mass attempts. Key: keep lower boom (nodes 1-2-3) light, add vertical/diagonal bracing (triangle networks), shift apex node high enough for braced triangulation but not so much as to add member length wastefully.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Member direction and positioning: \\n - Place node_4 at (2.0, 3.2) (slightly above previous node_4 for better arching, short global heights). \\n - Place node_5 at (3.3, 2.3) (above node_3, rightward for symmetry, splitting load). Connect: \\n1. node_1-node_4 (lattice left)\\n2. node_4-node_5 (left upper)\\n3. node_5-node_2 (right upper)\\n4. node_4-node_3 (left brace to loaded)\\n5. node_5-node_3 (right brace to loaded)\\n6. node_3-node_2 (lower chord right)\\n7. node_1-node_3 (lower chord left)\\n - Assign area_id \'1\' to lower lightly loaded base chords, and assign area_id \'3\' or \'4\' for highly stressed diagonals/verticals (from initial force balance, areas above 1.75 adequate for max ~25kN for short diagonals). Linear proportionality assumed. Connections ensure closed topology.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Estimate member forces with internal equilibrium (sections on either side of node_3) for diagonals under 33.5kN resultant; distributing the load means ~17kN per major diagonal with increased lengths from elevation (applying trigonometry: l_diag ≈ √{(1.3)^2 + (2.3)^2}~2.67m for node_3 to node_5).\\n- Estimated stress: 17kN/1.759cm^2 ~ 9.7MPa for member area=1.759. Check mass: ∑(length × area) ≈ (2.6×0.195)+(2.5×0.195)+(2.8×1.759)+(2.0×1.759)+(2.67×1.759)+(4×0.195)+(2.0×0.195), gives <15. Mass constraint easily met. Pick area_id \'3\' for bracing diagonals pointing to node_3, area_id \'1\' for chords. Closed system, efficient load transfer.",\n    "scratch_pad_final": "All supports/loads are fixed as required.
