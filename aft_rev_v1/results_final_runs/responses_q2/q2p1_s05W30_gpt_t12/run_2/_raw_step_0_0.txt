Objective: Find a triangular geometry and assign member areas to minimize max(abs(stress))/total_weight ≤ 0.5 and mass ≤ 30, with optimal force flow/performance.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Current status: Three nodes in near-collinear arrangement on the x-axis: node_1=(0,0), node_2=(6,0), node_3=(2,0); row-based truss options are poor for stability/force transfer. Loads are applied significantly downward and leftward at node_3. Only the given three nodes—so best closed truss is triangle with direct connections. Differences in support conditions and load location suggest particular geometric strategies and area distributions for optimization.",\n\n    "analysis": "Supports: node_1 is pinned, nodes_2 & 3 are rollers. Directly connecting all three forms a triangle, intrinsically stable. Load applied at node_3 (-15, -30) suggests that members joining node_3 must have adequate axial tension/compression performance; minimizing lengths of highly stressed members and selecting area for stress-control. With mass constraint (given areas list), stress-distribution can be shaped by using higher areas for likely critical members. Triangle connectivity simplifies calculation; possible high stresses in longer bottom member as it transmits both horizontal and vertical forces away from node_3. Member between nodes_1 & 3 is short—likely to attract much of the load, so may need larger area assigned.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Design relies on direct node interconnection, for a closed structure given only three node locations. Stress minimization suggests using largest practical area for most-loaded members (likely those linking with node_3). Since max(abs(stress))/weight ∝ (|force|/area)/(total mass), stress can be controlled by area, but increasing area increases mass—trade-off needed within constraints. Must estimate expected internal forces via statics for typical triangular truss. Mass is sum(L_i * A_i), with length data. Double-check mass for largest allowed areas; possibly optimize area allocation across members for minimal stress:mass ratio (by candidate force distribution/cut equations).",\n\n    "reasoning": "Physically optimal: Complete triangle (closed) between all three nodes. Expect maximum force either in bottom chord (node_1-node_2, where supports transfer load) or diagonals (nod_1-3, node_2-3 where load directly enters/exits the truss). Assign smallest possible area to least-loaded member (likely node_2-node_3), and check that mass and stress/weight targets are met if using largest (\'10\') or penultimate largest (\'9\') on the critical members (node_3 connected). Area_id assignments are favored as: largest (max) on node_1-node_3 and node_1-node_2, just sufficient/allowed on node_2-node_3. Geometry can\'t be improved given node constraints with minimum of three nodes and all must be connected (closed). Anticipate most load handled by node_1-node_3 (shortest, best-aligned with external load at node_3).",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: material/area fully resists member axial force (F/A), ignore buckling/check with slenderness factor only if member area is excessive/small ratio of length. Calculation setup: 1) Compute geometric lengths: node_1-node_2=6, node_1-node_3=2, node_2-node_3=4. 2) By joint method or cut method, estimate internal forces with assumed directions. Use sum Fx/sum Fy equilibrium equations at joints for forced equilibrium: -15,-30 at node_3 peeled off to member_1-3 and member_2-3. 3) For each member, pick area assignment starting at largest possible. Total mass=sum(L_i × area_val), match or slightly undershoot mass constraint. Use largest possible area assignments for max loaded members; confirm stress analysis yields max(abs(stress))/mass <=0.5. Assign lowest suitable area remainder to node_2-3 (least loaded expected). Values: area_id \'10\': 19.548, \'8\':12.511, \'4\':3.128.",\n\n    "calculation": "Geometries: L_13=2, L_12=6, L_23=4.

So let\'s calculate full lengths and area mass:\\nmass (max possible: assign \'8\'=12.511ea to all three): mass=2*12.511 + 6*12.511 + 4*12.511=12*12.511=150.132 (far overshoot!)\\nTake instead: \'4\'=3.128 assigns\\ntotal_mass=(2+4+6)*3.128=12*3.128=37.536 (above constraint 30)\\n\'2\'=0.782:\\nmass=(2+4+6)*0.782=9.384 (well below measure)\\nTry critical assignment: member_1 (\'1-3\') & member_3 (\'1-2\') as \'4\'=3.128, member_2 (\'2-3\') as \'2\'=0.782:\\ntotal_mass=2*3.128+6*3.128+4*0.782=6.256+18.768+3.128=28.15 (acceptable)\\nEstimate critical stresses (member_1: F=total_load applied to member_length2 orientation, so F_13 ~ sqrt((15)^2 + (30)^2) = ~33.54kN (by parallelogram law); stress in member_1: σ=F/A = 33.54/3.128=10.73; max σ/weight=10.73/28.152≈0.381, within stress ratio bound).\\nRecheck: reserve larger area on heavily loaded member (\'1-3\'), see if it\'s worthwhile. Bump area to \'5\'=4.887: mass=2*4.887+6*3.128+4*0.782=9.774+18.768+3.128=31.67 (slight violation of mass).
