The structure must remain within all constraints (stress-to-weight ≤ 0.5, mass ≤ 30) and utilize refined geometry or topology as needed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Status: Both current and history-best (rank_1) options meet constraints, but history-best truss is simpler, weighs less, and produces ~42% lower stress-to-weight ratio. Objective is to improve efficiency while including all constraint, using geometric or area-area-member changes if possible.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Supports & loads are strictly fixed. \'node_1\', \'node_2\', \'node_3\' must not move, as loads/supports are present. Highest-ranked history (\'rank_1\') achieves 0.1353 ratio through a direct minimal triangle. The expanded layout (current structure) improvised with additional nodes and a near-vertical dome. However, its more distributed layouts have higher edge-count and still a worse stress-to-weight than the minimal case. Members in current solution mainly carry modest stress; only one (\'member_1\') sees high compressive stress (-6.69), but the total structure mass is also marginally higher. Given all topologies satisfied constraints, the minimal triangle already minimizes load path and material for this support/load configuration.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Direct minimum triangle (nodes 1-2-3) is optimal for stress paths under the given single external load. Repeated nodes and extra connections did not improve, and only increased mass and potential local overstress. Diversity in member areas can help, but all area_id combinations in \'rank_1\' are valid, efficiently assigned.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Revert to historic best: return the minimum triangle from history (rank_1); this keeps the structure closed, stress-to-weight minimized, and ensures required constraints are met. No node repositions necessary, as fixed nodes fulfill layout and boundary requirements. No further optimization likely, since stress-to-weight ratio is near theoretical minimum for given supports, load, and area IDs.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulated forms (as in the history-best triangle) ensure maximum geometric rigidity, shorter member lengths, direct force transfer between supports and loads. Load at node_3 is best transmitted directly to nodes 1-2, using thick lower chords (area 4) to decrease stress, and a light (area 2) top connection. All members active. Larger/denser topologies will only add weight or localize forces, hurting the stress-to-weight ratio.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Geometry: nodes are colinear along the support line; no optimization needed for positions. Select member areas as per rank_1: lower chords maximized, vertical/lightest element minimized. Calculation: stress-to-weight ratio = 3.81/28.152 = 0.1353. Areas double checked with area_id->area_dict mapping; total mass under 30kg. No originality needed in positions as supports/loads are fixed;",\n    \n    "calculation": "Area IDs: member_1 [\'node_1\',\'node_3\',\'4\'] gives adequate capacity; member_2: [\'node_2\',\'node_3\',\'2\'] ~1.384kN, safe; upper chord [\'node_1\',\'node_2\',\'4\']. Single triangle, total mass 28.152, max(abs(stress)) 3.81, stress-to-weight 0.1353. All constraints (mass & ratio) well within limits. No isolated or redundant nodes; structure closed and stable.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Conclude: further reduction infeasible while obeying all required connections and constraints (supports, load, closure), current triangle solution in \'rank_1\' is optimal.
