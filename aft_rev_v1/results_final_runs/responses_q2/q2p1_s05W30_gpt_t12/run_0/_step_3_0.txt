    "preamble": "The task is to generate an optimal 2D truss satisfying two stringent constraints: stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 0.5 and total mass ≤ 30, given the existing nodes, supports, and a critical downward load applied at a supported node. Previous structures did not meet the stress-to-weight constraint.",

    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs: 3 base nodes on x-axis, fourth node above (current node_4 at (2.0, 3.5)), supports at nodes 1 (pinned), 2, 3 (rollers), load at node_3. Exceeded stress-to-weight in all cases (~0.7446). Current mass (14.505 and up) is good but stress in some members is too high.",

    "analysis": "Current truss lacks depth for effective load distribution; node_4 is directly above loaded node_3, supporting vertical loads—but lack of additional height/depth limits other members' contribution to resisting the heavy sloped load at node_3. The load at node_3, very close to the x-axis, produces high forces (especially in member_1: -10.8 in 2nd iteration). Attempts across historic trusses to mitigate high stress by adding new upper nodes (e.g. node_5 in generation history) did not reduce maximum stress below constraint. The key systemic issue is insufficient triangulation andleverage in top chords.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Pattern: Adding upper nodes helps stress distribution but may insufficiently increase out-of-plane brace effect unless geometry changes (higher node4/location or more triangle completion). Insight: Overstressed bottom chord between pinned and loaded nodes. Benefit in extending node_4 further up and introducing an additional top node (for ‘Warren’ or ‘Pratt’ double triangle form), letting the loaded node connect to both upper nodes, distributing load more evenly and reducing most stressed bottom member's force.",

    "proposal": "Redesign the current configuration. Keep node_4, but move it further up for longer upper members (reducing force in bottom). Add a single upper node_5 at (4.0, 3.7), creating two interlinked triangles with node_2. Members: all bottom and top chords, two diagonals from the loaded node upward, and both upper nodes tied to both ends. Areas: Lower at top, upper for bottom chord and diagonals, ensure no member is overly thin.",

    "reasoning": "A rigid, symmetrical double-triangle planar truss distributes the downward/slant load efficiently—spreading forces to both bases, dequeuing moment and reducing local booms/bottle-necks. Tallening the truss increases lever arm, dropping chord forces. Assign minimal bottom chord area (area_0), minimal vertical/diagonals (area_1 and area_2) but guarantee sufficient flow. Use extra upper node to fully close loops (each node connected). Overall, a nearly minimal-weight double-triangle/Warren-type.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Knowns: Load at node_3: (-15, -30), acting about θ=193°. Node_1 (pinned at left), node_2 (roller right), node_3 (roller w/load). Current structure runs bottom chord straight with upright; stress problem is max in key member directly loaded by the large applied force. Move node_4 further upward (to y=4.5–4.8), place node_5 symmetrically about node_2 \u2013 connect to form two tight triangles. Assign keys: all nodes used. Members: bottom chord, verticals, diagonals, two top chords. Bottom chord must be strong, all triangles for closure. Estimate top chords, diagonals with moderate area, verticals with smallest. Triangulate, member selection by area accordingly. Initial area selection: bottom ('area_0':1), highest member forces get slight bump (e.g. top/diagonal: area_1:0.195/0.782). Double check closure and mass computations.",

    "calculation": "Key member lengths: node_1-(0,0), node_2-(6.0,0), node_3-(2.0,0), node_4-(2.0,4.7), node_5-(4.0,3.7). Bottoms: node_1-3 (2.0), 3-2 (4.0). vert node_3-4 (4.7), diag 1: node_1-4 ≈ sqrt(2^2+4.7^2)=5.12; diag 2: 3-5 ≈ sqrt(2.0^2 + 3.7^2) = 4.21. top chord node_4-5 ≈ sqrt(2.0^2 + 1.0^2) = 2.24. Top right diag: node_5-2 ≈ sqrt(2.0^2+3.7^2)=4.21. Check fully closed: yes, at each node. Select areas: bottom: area_0: '0' (strong, but minimize total mass by constraint); diagonals, top,; remainder: area_1: '1'. Combined: Bottom and diagonals’re most loaded: apply '2' for diagonals (midweight). Remaining: vertical and upper top chord: area_1 or '1'. Estimate total mass: sum(L*area); (2.0+4.0)*1 + (5.12+4.21+4.21)*0.782 + (2.24)*0.195 = approx 6.0 + 10.11*0.782 + 2.24*0.195 = 6.0+7.91+0.44 ≈ 14.35, under limit. Use stiffer diagonal chords flexibly. By geometry, this truss will distribute load more efficiently, reducing maximum per-member stress. Stress-to-weight will reduce; estimate, high member force about half that in previous bot-chord (due to 2 x diagonal support and greater vertical distance). Stress estimate under constraint.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "Confirm fully connected structure, correct member defines, no overlaps, close member loops, minimum area by ID @{list}. Areas per assignments, no unnecessary elements, each node a support or load or scissor-support. All constraints met per estimation, max stress/weight < 0.5. Use floated decimal for positions to nearest 0.01. No placeholder areas.",
