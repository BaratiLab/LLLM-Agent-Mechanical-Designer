    "preamble": "This problem requires creation of the most efficient, constraint-satisfying, closed 2D truss structure using given supports, nodes, and load for minimal stress-to-weight ratio. All nodes must be part of a robust, triangulated arrangement, choosing area_id only from a fixed menu, while complying with total mass and stress-to-weight requirements.",

    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), supports with pinned at left, rollers right/middle, and a large diagonal load at (2,0), direct triangles are needed for closure and for shortest load paths. Stress-to-weight <= 0.5, and max mass 30. Areas are quantized by ID, so must map smallest possible.",
    
    "analysis": "Load at node_3 acts strongly left and downward, node_1 is well chosen as pinned (fixed position), node_2 as roller allows Y slip. To close the truss and ensure robustness, members will connect all nodes and possibly add a fourth node above the base for strength. A triangle or double-triangulated 'inverted Y' or K-truss form joins all support nodes and creates shortest force flow for applied load at node_3. Chord members on same y=0 axis will likely be compression/tension; diagonals converted to minimize member stress given the force's major vertical and horizontal value. Member selection must use smallest cross-section satisfying all constraints. Too large will violate weight, too small risks overstress.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation is key to both stability and minimalistic use of members. New node added above mid-span, say ('node_4' at ~central y > 0), allows aligning top chords directly to loaded node_3 for clearer historically stress flow and creates additional triangles for closure with shortest structural lines. Connecting node_3 at (2,0) to node_4, as well as node_1–node_4 and node_2–node_4, closes the circuit without overproliferation. Overall length minimization critical for mass; so is efficient member sizing anchored by max force; must check stress/mass ratios for each leg.",
    
    "reasoning": "Using (pinned, roller, roller) boundary and highly off-axis load, a symmetric pitched triangle adds 'node_4' centered over node_3. Members: (node_1, node_2), (node_2, node_3), (node_1, node_3): closes base; adds (node_1, node_4), (node_2, node_4), (node_3, node_4): forms upper three triangles for maximum stiffness and unique stability. Member areas selected as small as possible for load merely to ensure stress doesn't violate the 0.5:1 constraint relative to mass.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Sum vertical/horizontal reactions at supports: (calculate by statics for indeterminate supports, but intuition: vertical force via y). Add all member lengths = Σ L_i; Mass = Σ (L_i * Area_i[area_id]); Max(normal_force/area_i) yields stress. Assign area_ids so max(abs(stress))/total_weight <= 0.5 and mass < 30. Node_4 selection at geometric centroid above, perhaps at (3.0,2.5) (estimate matches load direction). Evaluate projected member forces (by virtual work or direct equilibrium), prioritize smallest legal areas, recheck constraints.",
    
    "calculation": "Truss nodes: node_1:(0,0), node_2:(6,0), node_3:(2,0), new node_4:(3.00,2.50) wisely between support line and load direction for balance. All possible triangulated connections required. Compute approximate member lengths: (3-0,2.5-0) = ~3.90; (6-3,0-2.5) = ~3.90; (2-3,0-2.5)=~2.69. Chord (0,0)-(2,0):2.0, (2,0)-(6,0):4.0, (0,0)-(6,0):6.0. For major load (15kN, 30kN) at node_3, induced force primarily goes up diagonal 'node_3-node_4', with some base member sharing as triangle resolves for stability. Estimate that tensions/compressions in diagonals near resultant load: sqrt(15^2+30^2)=33.54 kN total at node_3, >90% in diagonal. To be safe: One largest force path gets area id '4' (A=3.128) for heavily loaded member(s) diagonal, other chords can use much smaller IDs. Let’s size diagonals and vertical with area '4', chords with '2' (0.782) or '1' (0.195), sum mass: check '<30', then stress: use F/A as check. Example: member_('node_3','node_4') gets all of point load so: F=33.54 kN, area=3.128→σ=10.73 MPa. Mass sum: diagonal=2.69*3.128=8.41, other diagonals 2×3.90×3.128=24.45; chords 2+4+6×0.195=2.34; sum ≈35.2>30. Go down: test area_id '3' for two biggest diagonals (A=1.759): 2.69×1.759=4.73; 2×3.9×1.759=13.73, chords as before=2.34; sum=20.8. Stress: 33.54/1.759=19.07. Stress-to-mass ratio ≈ 19.07/20.8 = 0.917 >0.5 (too much). Step up diagonal area ONLY for 'node_3-node_4' to '4', rest stay at '3': then 2.69×3.128=8.41 for major load path, 2×3.9×1.759=13.73 others, 2.34=chords, sum~24.48. Max stress: 33.54/3.128=10.73, max ratio=10.73/24.48=0.439. Satisfies both ratio & mass constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met: structure closed, weight~24.5 < 30, stress-to-mass ~0.439<0.5. Diagonal for major load gets area_id '4'; others area_id '3'; base chords area_id '1'. Nodes precise (floats); all six unique members. Supports/load geometry unaltered; no duplicate nodes or members.",
