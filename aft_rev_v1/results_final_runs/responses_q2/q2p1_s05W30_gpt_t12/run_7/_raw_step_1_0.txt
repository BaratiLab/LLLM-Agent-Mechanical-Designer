Constraints: Ratio ≤ 0.5, mass ≤ 30. Current status meets constraints. Structural improvement sought.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective is a lightweight, efficient, connected (closed) truss. Nodes with supports and loads fixed by constraints. Evaluate if strengthening load path or redistributing mass/areas lowers stress-to-weight further. History shows only simple triangle.",\n    "analysis": "Current design is a triangle connecting all required nodes. Members: node_1-node_2 (\'2\'), node_2-node_3 (\'5\'), node_3-node_1 (\'2\'). Loads only at node_3, which is supported (roller). node_1 is pinned. Areas: Mix of light (\'2\', \'2\') and one heavy (\'5\'). Mass: 25.804, max_stress: 12.77, ratio: 0.4949. Only one possible closed truss exists using the three fixed nodes - a triangle, which is already implemented. Adjusting node placements is not permitted with loads/supports fixed; only member areas/membership may improve design, but triangle is the minimal design. Possibly area optimization could yield a slightly better ratio.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Reflection: Only areas can be tuned; adding nodes/members impossible without violating \'do not remove/modify supported/load nodes\'. Potential to re-optimize areas among members for better load path distribution while remaining under 30 mass, improving the ratio.",\n    "proposal": "Propose to reallocate cross-sectional areas between members (within allowed area_id set) to move largest member nearer load introduction, likely thicker elements where stress is highest (near node_3), lighter on less-stressed members while preserving closure and mass. Adjust member_3 (heavily loaded) up one area size, try downsizing member_2 and/or member_1, check new ratio/mass.",\n    "reasoning": "The highest-stress member is member_3 (= -12.77), running node_3-node_1. It should bear more load: upsize its area to next-bigger (\'3\':1.759, next is \'4\':3.128, next is \'5\':4.887). Simultaneously, member_2 is under low stress (0.62), indicating possible area reduction to save mass (from \'5\' down to \'4\' or \'3\'). Re-balance with current mass budget and observe impact.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Member mass = length × area. Try: member_3 area \'5\'→\'6\', member_2 area \'5\'→\'3\' or \'4\', member_1: maintain size unless constraints are tightened. All connections preserved (triangle over support/load nodes). Calculations about stress in truss, using area scaling: new_stress = old_stress × (old_area/new_area), helping test assignments. Mass: sum(length × area). Stress-to-weight: updated accordingly.
