    "preamble" :  "Goal: Minimize max(abs(stress))/total_weight in a closed 2D truss with nodes at [0,0] (pinned), [6,0] (roller), [2,0] (roller/load of [-15,-30]). Constraints: Ratio ≤ 0.5, mass ≤ 30. Current status meets constraints. Structural improvement sought.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective is a lightweight, efficient, connected (closed) truss. Nodes with supports and loads fixed by constraints. Evaluate if strengthening load path or redistributing mass/areas lowers stress-to-weight further. History shows only simple triangle.",
    "analysis": "Current design is a triangle connecting all required nodes. Members: node_1-node_2 ('2'), node_2-node_3 ('5'), node_3-node_1 ('2'). Loads only at node_3, which is supported (roller). node_1 is pinned. Areas: Mix of light ('2', '2') and one heavy ('5'). Mass: 25.804, max_stress: 12.77, ratio: 0.4949. Only one possible closed truss exists using the three fixed nodes - a triangle, which is already implemented. Adjusting node placements is not permitted with loads/supports fixed; only member areas/membership may improve design, but triangle is the minimal design. Possibly area optimization could yield a slightly better ratio.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "Reflection: Only areas can be tuned; adding nodes/members impossible without violating 'do not remove/modify supported/load nodes'. Potential to re-optimize areas among members for better load path distribution while remaining under 30 mass, improving the ratio.",
    "proposal": "Propose to reallocate cross-sectional areas between members (within allowed area_id set) to move largest member nearer load introduction, likely thicker elements where stress is highest (near node_3), lighter on less-stressed members while preserving closure and mass. Adjust member_3 (heavily loaded) up one area size, try downsizing member_2 and/or member_1, check new ratio/mass.",
    "reasoning": "The highest-stress member is member_3 (= -12.77), running node_3-node_1. It should bear more load: upsize its area to next-bigger ('3':1.759, next is '4':3.128, next is '5':4.887). Simultaneously, member_2 is under low stress (0.62), indicating possible area reduction to save mass (from '5' down to '4' or '3'). Re-balance with current mass budget and observe impact.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Member mass = length × area. Try: member_3 area '5'→'6', member_2 area '5'→'3' or '4', member_1: maintain size unless constraints are tightened. All connections preserved (triangle over support/load nodes). Calculations about stress in truss, using area scaling: new_stress = old_stress × (old_area/new_area), helping test assignments. Mass: sum(length × area). Stress-to-weight: updated accordingly. Proceed to pairings that minimize maxima for under 30 total mass.",
    "calculation": "member lengths: m1(node_1-node_2) =6.0; m2(node_2-node_3)=4.0; m3(node_3-node_1)=2.0. \nSuggested Areas: m1:'2'(0.782), m2:'3'(1.759), m3:'5'(4.887); \nmember_1: mass=6*0.782=4.692, \nmember_2: 4*1.759=7.036, \nmember_3: 2*4.887=9.774;\nTotal=21.502.<14%lt;30.\nStress scaling:\n m1: -3.8453×(0.782/0.782) = -3.85\n m2: 0.6153×(4.887/1.759)=~1.71\n m3: -12.7665×(1.564/4.887)=~ -4.08.\nMax abs(stress)=4.08, Ratio=4.08/21.502≈0.190. This is a net improvement with significant headroom.",
    "scratch_pad_final": "Final check: proposed areas + member lengths = total mass 21.50<30. Max(abs(stress)) much reduced (~4.08). Ratio ~0.19. The structure remains fully closed. No constraint violation. Coordinates preserved per instructions; only areas adjusted, which improves efficiency. No further significant improvement can be made without violating constraints on node modification. Optimized.",
