The current solution violates the main constraint: its stress-to-weight ratio is 1.98 (>0.5), indicating overstressed members relative to weight. The optimization objective is to minimize this ratio and total mass, keeping structure closed and all connections efficient.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Analyze inputs: Nodes at base, load at an internal point, base rectangle and single triangle, stress way too high in members connecting supports to node_3. Current members likely inefficient/only partially triangulated. Mass (23.8) is fine but not minimum.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Key findings: Current layout has node_3 as an in-plane midspan loaded point, but unfortunately main bottom members supporting the load are assigned very thin cross-sections (area_id \'1\'), resulting in extreme member stress (see -47.2 in member_4). Explicit triangulation is lacking—structure does not transfer load efficiently because major tension/compression is forced through members with insufficient area and unsymmetrical load paths. The load on node_3 is significant and excentric, amplifying stress, while side and vertical triangles are suboptimal.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Member stress extremes focus around node_3, area assignments mismatch load transfer. Node_4 (off-axis) attempts to distribute load but isn\'t well placed to do so. Expanded triangles above support line may relieve stress more efficiently. Closed triangles over supports recommended.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign structure for redundant, triangulated load paths—add a top chord (node_5) and enforce two main stable triangles bridging node_3 directly and efficiently to the supports. Assign larger areas to main span (support-to-load) members. Minimize noncritical member mass. Slightly adjust node_4 upward to give structure a trapezoidal shape. Place new top node above node_3 to connect supports and load vertically. Carefully adjust lengths to maintain mass constraint.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation and truss closure distribute the forces more evenly, allowing modest bar cross-sections while obeying the stress limit. Enlarging key areas on most loaded bars (over main span and directly from supports to loaded node), keeping bracing members slender. Add top chord connecting left&right supports above node_3. Height and position optimized to minimize bending length, turning ideas toward classic (Pratt/Warren) truss forms. Retain all original support/load node positions per constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Introduce new node above node_3 for wedge/diamond shape: node_5 at (2.00, 2.80). Areas: Bottom (chord)—moderate; Diagonal/support-to-top—larger; Webbing (node_4-to-others)—small. Key dimensions: node_1=(0,0), node_2=(6,0), node_3=(2,0), node_4=(2,1.30), node_5=(2,2.80). Members: form 2 base triangles + verticals. Mass: sum(length x area), select smallest possible areas subject to stress <= 0.5*total_mass.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Estimate main load path: members from supports to node_3 and node_5 take key stresses. Take top and bottom chords (between node_1<->node_2, node_4<->node_5) modest—area_id=2 or 3. Diagonals/supports use area, possibly id \'4\' or \'5\', assign \'1\' or \'2\' to verticals. Assess effective stress if F (e.g. 34N) divides across 2 main diagonals—roughly 15kN tension/compression across ~3 unit length = 5 kN/unit. For an area of area_id=5 (4.887), stress ~3.1 << allowable. Mass forms well below mass constraint—ensure mass doesn\'t breach 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Double-check areas: ensure heavy diagonals/bracing have enough section.
