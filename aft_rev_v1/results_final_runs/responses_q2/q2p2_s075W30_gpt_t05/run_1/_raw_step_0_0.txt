The objective is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio (max(abs(stress))/total_weight), while ensuring all constraints (stress-to-weight ≤ 0.75, total mass ≤ 30, and all nodes connected) are satisfied. The design uses only the specified area IDs and may introduce new nodes if justified.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three nodes in a straight line at y=0, with a significant off-axis load at node_3, and mixed boundary conditions (pinned at node_1, roller at node_2 and node_3). The truss must be closed and fully connected. Stress-to-weight ratio and total mass are tightly constrained. Triangulation is likely required for stability and low stress.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Node_3 is loaded with (-15, -30), i.e., a force of 33.54 units at about 243.43° from x-axis. Nodes are colinear (x=0,2,6). A simple triangle is the minimum closed structure. However, with all nodes on y=0, vertical load transfer is poor, so a new node above or below y=0 is required to form a stable triangle and distribute the off-axis load efficiently. Adding a fourth node above the base (say, at (3,2.5)), creates two triangles and provides a direct load path for both x and y components of the load.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The main challenge is to avoid high stresses in the horizontal members due to the vertical load. Raising a new node above the base forms a stable triangle, reducing member forces. The optimal location for the new node should be near the centroid of the base to balance force distribution. Member areas should be chosen to balance mass and stress, using higher areas where forces are greatest.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Placing a new node (node_4) at (3.0,2.5) above the center of the base creates two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4). This allows the vertical load at node_3 to be shared by two diagonals. Members connecting all nodes ensure closure. Areas are selected based on estimated force magnitudes: larger for diagonals, smaller for shorter or less loaded members. This configuration minimizes stress-to-weight ratio while maintaining closure and stability.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Pin jointed truss, all loads transferred axially, self-weight neglected (except in mass calc), E=constant, area IDs as per table. Steps: 1) Calculate member lengths. 2) Set up equilibrium at node_3. 3) Estimate force in diagonals by resolving load along member directions. 4) Assign area IDs to keep max stress reasonable. 5) Calculate total mass and check constraints. 6) Adjust areas if needed.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (3,2.5). Member lengths: L13=2.0, L23=4.0, L14=3.90, L24=3.90, L34=2.06. Assign areas: diagonals (node_3-node_4, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4) get area_id \'5\' (A=4.887), base members (node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3) get area_id \'1\' (A=0.195). Calculate member forces by resolving the load at node_3 into the two diagonals (node_3-node_4, node_3-node_1, node_3-node_2). Estimate max force in diagonals as ~half the resultant load (33.54/2 ≈ 16.77). Stress in diagonals: 16.77/4.887 ≈ 3.43. Weight: sum(L*A) = (2*0.195)+(4*0.195)+(3.90*4.887*2)+(2.06*4.887) = 0.39+0.78+38.17+10.08=49.42. This exceeds mass constraint. Reduce diagonal area to \'3\' (A=1.759): stress = 16.77/1.759=9.54, mass=(3.90*1.759*2)+(2.06*1.759)+(2*0.195)+(4*0.195)=13.72+3.62+0.39+0.78=18.51.
