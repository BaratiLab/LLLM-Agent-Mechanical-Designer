    "preamble": "This is a single-shot optimization for a 2D truss using three nodes with fixed positions, specified supports, and a given load. The goal is to design a closed truss (all nodes connected) that minimizes the stress-to-weight ratio, while ensuring the structure is statically determinate, lightweight, and satisfies all constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three nodes in a nearly collinear arrangement with node_3 offset slightly, and a substantial off-axis load at node_3, the truss must be closed, statically determinate, and efficiently distribute forces. Only the three nodes are provided, but the use of a fourth node (to form a triangle) may be considered for optimal triangulation and stress reduction.",
    
    "analysis": "Supports: node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 (roller). Load at node_3 is (-15.0, -30.0), i.e., left and downward. The nodes as given are (0.0, 0.0), (6.0, 0.0), and (2.0, 0.0) — nearly collinear. A triangle is the minimum closed truss, but collinearity is structurally unstable. To ensure triangulation and stability, add a node above the base to create a stable triangle. Connecting all nodes forms two triangles, distributing the load efficiently and minimizing stress.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "The original nodes are collinear, which is not optimal for a truss. Adding a fourth node above the base (e.g., at (3.0, 2.5)) creates two triangles. This enables vertical and horizontal load paths, reducing the stress in each member and lowering the maximum stress-to-weight ratio. The load at node_3 can be shared among more members, further reducing peak stresses.",
    
    "reasoning": "To minimize the stress-to-weight ratio, use the smallest possible cross-sectional areas that satisfy the constraints. The optimal structure is a quadrilateral with diagonals (i.e., two triangles sharing a side). The new node (node_4) is placed above the centroid of the base to maximize symmetry and even force distribution. Members are chosen to create two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4), (node_2, node_3, node_4), plus the base. This ensures all nodes are included, the structure is closed, and load paths are efficient.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume E = 1 (relative), all members are pin-jointed, and self-weight is proportional to length × area. For each member, calculate length, assign area_id from allowed set, estimate member forces via static equilibrium (approximate as a symmetric truss under off-center load). Select area_ids such that max(abs(stress))/total_weight <= 0.75 and total mass <= 30. Use trigonometry to determine member lengths. Assign minimum area_ids that satisfy stress constraints.",
    
    "calculation": "Place node_4 at (3.0, 2.5). Members: (node_1-node_2), (node_2-node_3), (node_3-node_1), (node_1-node_4), (node_2-node_4), (node_3-node_4). Compute lengths: node_1-node_2: 6.0, node_2-node_3: 4.0, node_3-node_1: 2.0, node_1-node_4: sqrt(3^2+2.5^2)=3.90, node_2-node_4: sqrt(3^2+2.5^2)=3.90, node_3-node_4: sqrt(1^2+2.5^2)=2.69. Estimate member forces using method of joints (approximate max force ~20), select area_id '3' (A=1.759) for all members. Mass = sum(lengths) × area = (6+4+2+3.90+3.90+2.69)×1.759 = 22.49. Compute max(abs(stress))/total_weight: max force/total mass ≈ 20/22.49 = 0.89 (>0.75). Increase area_id for longest/highest force members (node_1-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4) to '4' (A=3.128). Recompute mass: (6+3.90+3.90)×3.128 + (4+2+2.69)×1.759 = 13.8×3.128 + 8.69×1.759 = 43.17+15.28=58.45 (>30). Reduce area_ids: set all to '2' (A=0.782). Mass = 22.49×0.782=17.58. Max force/total mass = 20/17.58=1.14 (>0.75). Try area_id '3' for node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4, rest '2'. Mass = (3.90+3.90)×1.759 + (6+4+2+2.69)×0.782 = 7.8×1.759 + 14.69×0.782 = 13.73+11.48=25.21. Max force/total mass = 20/25.21=0.79 (>0.75). Try area_id '4' for node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, rest '2': mass = 7.8×3.128 + 14.69×0.782 = 24.40+11.48=35.88 (>30). Try area_id '3' for node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_1-node_2, rest '2': mass = (3.90+3.90+6)×1.759 + (4+2+2.69)×0.782 = 13.8×1.759+8.69×0.782=24.27+6.79=31.06 (>30). Try area_id '3' for node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_2-node_3, rest '2': mass = (3.90+3.90+4)×1.759 + (6+2+2.69)×0.782 = 11.8×1.759+10.69×0.782=20.77+8.36=29.13.
