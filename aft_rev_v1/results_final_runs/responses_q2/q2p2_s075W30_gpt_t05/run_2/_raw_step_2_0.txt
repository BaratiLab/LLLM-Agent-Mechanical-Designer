The goal is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio while staying within mass and stress constraints. The current and historic designs are feasible, but improvements are sought.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs specify nodes, supports, a downward+leftward load at node_3, and a closed truss. Current structure is feasible (ratio 0.3917, mass 17.49), but historic design achieves a lower ratio (0.1735) at higher mass (23.40). Objective: lower stress-to-weight ratio, keep mass < 30, ratio < 0.75.",\n    "analysis": "The load at node_3 (-15, -30) is significant. Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 (roller) create a stable base. Current truss has node_4 at (3.0, 2.5), forming a nearly symmetric triangle above the base. Historic best design shifts node_4 to (2.0, 2.5), making the truss more compact and moving the upper node closer to the loaded node_3. This reduces lever arms and stress, but increases member lengths and mass due to heavier area assignments. Load paths in both designs are efficient: force flows from node_3 to supports via triangulated members. Most stress is in member_1 (node_1-node_3), suggesting it is the critical path.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Historic design\'s lower stress-to-weight ratio is due to larger member areas (especially member_1 and member_5 at area_id 4), but this increases mass. Current design is lighter, but has higher max stress. Both are feasible, but there\'s room to further reduce the stress-to-weight ratio by adjusting node_4\'s position for better force distribution, or by tuning member areas for more balanced utilization.",\n    "proposal": "Propose a hybrid approach: move node_4 slightly left from the historic design (to x=2.5 instead of 2.0), keeping it close to the loaded node_3, but reducing the length (and mass) of members from node_1 and node_2. Assign member areas to keep stress below limits, but avoid over-sizing. This should yield a lower stress-to-weight ratio than the current design, with less mass penalty than the historic best.",\n    "reasoning": "Shifting node_4 closer to node_3 shortens the most highly-stressed members (node_1-node_4 and node_3-node_4), reducing their force and stress. Keeping node_4 above the base increases vertical stiffness and improves load transfer. Assigning area_id 3 to member_1 and member_5 (the most stressed), and area_id 2 to others, balances stress and mass. This triangulation ensures all members are engaged and no node is isolated.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume node_1 at (0,0), node_2 at (6,0), node_3 at (2,0), node_4 at (2.5,2.5).

Assign areas: member_1 (3), member_2 (2), member_3 (2), member_4 (2), member_5 (3). Mass = sum(length Ã— area). Estimate stresses: expect max stress < 5, mass < 20.
