The current structure is feasible but not optimal; prior history shows a design with significantly lower stress-to-weight ratio and lower peak stress, albeit at higher mass. The goal is to achieve the lowest possible stress-to-weight ratio without exceeding mass or stress limits.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs show all constraints are satisfied, but the current design\'s stress-to-weight ratio (0.4038) is higher than the best historic solution (0.1735). Node positions and member areas can be fine-tuned for improved efficiency. Supports and loads are fixed at their current nodes.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The load at node_3 is significant and off-center, creating both vertical and horizontal force components. The current and historic structures use a quadrilateral (nodes 1-2-4-3) with a diagonal, forming two triangles for stability. The lowest stress-to-weight ratio in history is achieved by raising node_4 vertically above node_3 (at [2.0, 2.5]), which reduces the lever arm and distributes forces more efficiently, but at the cost of increased total mass due to larger area members. The current design ([2.5, 2.5]) and another historic ([3.0, 2.5]) are more horizontally spread, which increases member forces and stress-to-weight ratio. The best design (rank_1) uses larger member areas (area_id \'4\') for the bottom chord and diagonal, reducing peak stress, though at the cost of higher mass. All designs are statically determinate and closed, but the best historic design achieves better stress distribution.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Lowering the height of node_4 increases stress-to-weight ratio; raising it (vertically above node_3) reduces stress at the cost of mass. Using larger area_id members for the most highly stressed members (bottom chord, diagonal) is effective. The best design uses area_id \'4\' for the bottom chord and diagonal, area_id \'2\' for the others. All nodes are connected and no floating nodes exist. The current design can be improved by adopting the geometry and member sizing of the best historic solution.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Adopt the best historic design (rank_1), as it has the lowest stress-to-weight ratio (0.1735), lowest max stress (4.06), and satisfies all constraints. No further improvement is possible without violating mass or stress constraints. Node_4 will be placed at (2.0, 2.5), directly above node_3, and member areas will be assigned as in rank_1.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Placing node_4 directly above node_3 creates two symmetric triangles, minimizing force eccentricity and distributing the load more uniformly. Using larger area members for the most stressed elements (bottom chord and diagonal) reduces peak stress, optimizing the stress-to-weight ratio. The design remains statically determinate, closed, and satisfies all constraints. No further reduction in stress-to-weight ratio is possible without increasing mass or violating constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Supports and load nodes are fixed. Node_4 is placed at (2.0, 2.5) for vertical alignment. Member_1 and member_5 (bottom chord and diagonal) use area_id \'4\' for higher capacity; others use area_id \'2\'. Mass is calculated as sum(length Ã— area). Stresses are from historic FEM results. All constraints are satisfied.",\n    \n    "calculation": "From historic data: total_mass = 23.40 (<30), max_stress = 4.06 (<inf), max_stress_to_weight_ratio = 0.1735 (<0.75).
