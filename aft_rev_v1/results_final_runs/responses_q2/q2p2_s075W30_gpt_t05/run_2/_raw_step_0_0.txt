The design must be fully connected and satisfy both stress-to-weight and total mass limits using only allowed cross-sectional area IDs.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given: 3 nodes in a line (node_1: pinned at (0,0), node_2: roller at (6,0), node_3: roller at (2,0)). Load (-15, -30) applied to node_3. Must connect all nodes in a single structure. Constraints: stress-to-weight <= 0.75, mass <= 30. All members must use allowed area IDs. Closed truss means at least a triangle. Node positions can be added if structurally justified.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Nodes are colinear, so direct connections would lead to instability and high stresses. The load at node_3 is both horizontal and vertical, requiring stable out-of-plane resistance. To stabilize, we must add at least one node off the x-axis to form a triangle, ensuring all nodes are connected. Triangulation is essential for minimal weight and maximum stiffness. The pinned support at node_1 and rollers at the others allows horizontal expansion at node_2 and node_3. The optimal load path is from node_3 to both supports, minimizing member forces. Efficient force distribution suggests a symmetric triangle with a new node above node_3.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation is key. Place a new node above node_3 to create two triangles: (node_1, node_3, new_node) and (node_2, node_3, new_node), and connect supports directly. This allows vertical and horizontal load transfer. The new node\'s height should be enough to reduce member forces but not so high as to increase member lengths and mass. Members must be assigned area IDs to keep stress below the threshold and total mass under 30.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (2,2.5): directly above node_3 for symmetric load distribution. Connect node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_2-node_4, node_4-node_1, node_3-node_4. This forms two triangles sharing base node_3-node_4, ensuring all nodes are connected and structure is stable. Distribute load from node_3 into both triangles. Select smallest possible area IDs that satisfy stress constraints for each member. Estimate member forces using statics and geometry.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume all members are pin-jointed. For geometry: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (2,2.5). Member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_2 = 4.0, node_1-node_4 = sqrt(2^2 + 2.5^2) = 3.20, node_2-node_4 = sqrt(4^2 + 2.5^2) = 4.72, node_3-node_4 = 2.5. Assign area IDs: start with \'2\' (0.782) for diagonals, \'1\' (0.195) for shorter members. Calculate member forces under applied load using method of joints. Mass = sum(length × area). Stress = force / area. Ensure max(abs(stress))/total_weight <= 0.75 and mass <= 30.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: L13=2.0, L32=4.0, L14=3.20, L24=4.72, L34=2.5. Assign area_id: \'1\' (0.195) to L13, L32, L34; \'2\' (0.782) to L14, L24. Mass = (2.0+4.0+2.5)*0.195 + (3.20+4.72)*0.782 = 1.27 + 6.23 = 7.50 < 30. Estimate max member force: load at node_3 splits between node_1 and node_4; member_34 and member_13 take most load. For area 0.195, max stress = 15/0.195 ≈ 76.9 (too high), so increase area for these members to \'2\' (0.782), max stress = 15/0.782 ≈ 19.2. Total weight = 7.50, max(abs(stress))/total_weight ≈ 19.2/7.50 ≈ 2.56 > 0.75, so increase area further for highest-stressed members. Try area_id \'5\' (4.887) for most loaded members: stress = 15/4.887 ≈ 3.07, ratio = 3.07/10.23 ≈ 0.30 < 0.75, mass = (2.0+2.5)*4.887 + (4.0)*0.782 + (3.20+4.72)*0.782 = 22.0 + 3.13 + 6.23 = 31.36 (slightly above 30). Reduce area on less loaded members to \'1\'. Final: assign \'4\' (3.128) to L13, L34; \'2\' (0.782) to others. Mass = (2.0+2.5)*3.128 + (4.0+3.20+4.72)*0.782 = 14.06 + 9.39 = 23.45 < 30. Max stress = 15/3.128 ≈ 4.80, ratio = 4.80/23.45 ≈ 0.20 < 0.75.
