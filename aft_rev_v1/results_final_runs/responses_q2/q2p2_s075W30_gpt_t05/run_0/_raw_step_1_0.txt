The current design fails both the stress-to-weight ratio (1.82 > 0.75) and is on the threshold of the mass constraint (29.40 < 30). The objective is to redesign the truss to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio and ensure all constraints are satisfied, while keeping all supports and loaded nodes fixed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives: Satisfy stress-to-weight ≤ 0.75 and mass ≤ 30. Current mass is nearly maximal, but stress-to-weight is much too high. The previous design is a simple quadrilateral with diagonals, but member sizing and geometry lead to high stresses in some members.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current truss uses a nearly rectangular configuration with a single upper node (node_4) above the base. The largest stress is in member_1 (-53.5), which is a short horizontal member at the base, likely due to poor triangulation and inefficient force transfer from the loaded node_3 to the supports. Most of the mass is concentrated in member_3 and member_4 (vertical members), suggesting inefficient use of material. The structure is not well-triangulated, leading to high local forces. The load at node_3 is off-center, so improved triangulation and load path efficiency are needed. The supports at nodes 1, 2, and 3 must remain fixed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Overly heavy verticals, underutilized diagonals. The main horizontal base members are too short to effectively distribute load, and the upper node_4 is too high, making verticals long and heavy. The lack of additional nodes restricts triangulation. Adding another node above node_2 can improve load distribution and reduce force in the critical horizontal base member.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss with an additional node (node_5) above node_2, forming a double-triangle (Warren) truss. Use smaller area members where possible, and optimize node_4 and node_5 heights to minimize member lengths and maximize triangulation. This will distribute the load more efficiently, reduce peak member stresses, and allow use of lighter sections.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation (Warren or Pratt truss style) reduces bending and high local forces by providing multiple load paths. Raising node_4 and adding node_5 above node_2 shortens the verticals and spreads the applied load at node_3. Careful selection of member areas (using area_id \'1\' or \'2\' for non-critical members, \'3\' for main diagonals) keeps mass low. All nodes remain connected, and supports/loads are unchanged.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumption: Material is homogeneous; critical members (diagonals) may need area_id \'3\', others can use \'1\' or \'2\'. Estimate new node positions for efficient force transfer: node_4 at (2.0, 1.8) and node_5 at (6.0, 1.8). Base remains at y=0. Calculate member lengths and approximate stresses using geometry and load paths. Total member count: 7 (forming two triangles).",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3: 2.0m, node_3-node_2: 4.0m, node_1-node_4: sqrt(2^2+1.8^2)=2.69m, node_4-node_3: 1.8m, node_4-node_5: 4.0m, node_5-node_2: 1.8m, node_3-node_5: sqrt(4^2+1.8^2)=4.39m. Assign area_id: base horizontals and short verticals get \'1\', diagonals get \'2\' or \'3\'. Estimate mass: sum(length × area_factor). Check stress: with improved triangulation, expect max member stress ~15 (well below previous 53), and stress-to-weight ratio < 0.75. All nodes are connected, and structure is closed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Verify all constraints: stress-to-weight ratio expected < 0.75, total mass expected < 20.
