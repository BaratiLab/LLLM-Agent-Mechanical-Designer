The current best design achieves 0.3563, but historic structures suggest possible improvement.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: Minimize stress-to-weight ratio. Constraints: stress-to-weight ≤ 0.75, total mass ≤ 30. Current best: 0.3563, mass 11.65, max_stress 4.15. All constraints met. Node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed (supports/load). Remaining nodes can be tuned.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current and historic designs are closed trusses with moderate triangulation. The best historic design (rank_1) has lower stress-to-weight (0.3181) but double the mass (22.86) and higher max stress (7.27). The current structure is lighter and less stressed, but less efficient by ratio. Most members in current design are underutilized (zero or near-zero stress), indicating possible redundancy or non-optimal load path. Only member_1 is heavily loaded. The historic best structure uses more members and larger areas for main load paths, distributing forces more evenly, but at a mass penalty. Both designs are valid and satisfy constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Current design is efficient in mass but not in stress distribution, with one member carrying almost all the load. Historic best improves stress distribution (lower ratio), but at much higher mass. Ideal: redistribute load more evenly, using triangulation and slightly larger critical member areas, without excessive mass increase. Consider moving node_4/node_5 slightly for better geometry and increasing area of main loaded member.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Fine-tune the current structure: (1) Slightly reposition nodes 4, 5, 6 to optimize angles and reduce max member stress; (2) Increase area of member_1 (main load path) to \'5\' (A=4.887) to lower its stress; (3) Slightly enlarge areas of other key members in the load path to further distribute force, while minimizing mass increase; (4) Keep overall geometry similar to current for minimal mass, but improve triangulation for better load sharing.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "The main load path is from node_1 to node_3 (member_1), which is heavily stressed. By increasing its area and slightly adjusting node_4, node_5, and node_6 upwards and outward, we can improve force angles and reduce local stress concentrations. Slightly increasing the area of the diagonal (member_8) and the top chord (member_7) can further help distribute the load. This should reduce the max stress and the stress-to-weight ratio, without a large mass increase.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Areas chosen from allowed set. Node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Move node_4 to (0.7, 2.0), node_5 to (5.3, 2.0), node_6 to (2.0, 2.7) for improved angles. Use area_id \'5\' for member_1, \'2\' for member_8, \'1\' for others. Estimate member lengths, recalculate mass, and approximate new stresses (expect max stress in member_1 to drop by ~30%, others to rise slightly but stay low).",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member_1 (node_1-node_3): length ~2.0, area=4.887, mass=2.0*4.887=9.77.

Member_7 (top chord): length ~4.6, area=0.195, mass=0.90. Member_8 (node_3-node_6): length ~2.7, area=0.782, mass=2.11. Total mass ~15.08. With area of member_1 more than doubled, max stress expected to drop from 4.15 to ~2.0, so new stress-to-weight ratio ~2.0/15.08=0.133.
