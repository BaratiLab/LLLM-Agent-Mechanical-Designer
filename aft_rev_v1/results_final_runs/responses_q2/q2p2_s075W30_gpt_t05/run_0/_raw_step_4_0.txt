The current design violates the stress-to-weight constraint. The objective is to redesign or adjust the structure to meet all constraints with minimum mass and optimal efficiency.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Stress-to-weight ratio must be ≤ 0.75 and total mass ≤ 30. The load is at node_3 (-15, -30). Supports: pinned at node_1, rollers at node_2 and node_3. The previous best structure had a stress-to-weight ratio of 0.7791 (violates constraint), total mass 9.42 (acceptable). Historic best structure had a lower ratio but very high mass (22.86).",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current structure is a 6-node truss with a double triangle configuration above the base. The main issue is that the max stress-to-weight ratio is just above the limit, indicating that some members are over-stressed relative to their mass. Historic structures with larger member areas reduced the stress-to-weight ratio but greatly increased mass, which is not optimal. The load at node_3 is significant and eccentric, requiring efficient triangulation to distribute forces. The current member layout is nearly optimal for mass but needs minor adjustments for stress. The load path from node_3 to supports is direct, but the vertical elevation of node_6 may be insufficient to provide effective triangulation and reduce member forces.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Increasing member areas reduces stress-to-weight but increases mass. The geometry (node heights and horizontal spread) impacts force distribution and member stresses. The current node_6 may be too low, causing high forces in base members. The load at node_3 could be better resolved by raising the top chord and slightly increasing key member areas only where needed.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Optimize by slightly raising node_6 (apex), spreading nodes_4 and 5 outward for better triangulation, and selectively increasing area for the most critical members (those with highest stress). Avoid major mass increase. Keep all nodes with supports/loads fixed. Remove unnecessary members and ensure all nodes are connected for a closed truss.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Raising node_6 increases the vertical component of the top chord, reducing compressive/tensile forces in the lower members. Spreading nodes_4 and 5 outward shortens diagonal members, reducing their force. Selective area increase for the most highly stressed members (e.g., member_1) ensures stress-to-weight constraint is satisfied without a significant mass penalty. Symmetry about the truss axis improves load sharing and reduces local overstress.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All supports/nodes with loads remain fixed. Node_6 is raised to 2.5, nodes_4 and 5 are moved outward and up. Member_1 (node_1-node_3) has the highest stress; increase its area to \'4\' (3.128). Diagonal/top members remain at area \'1\' or \'2\'. Base members can remain at area \'1\'. Mass = sum(length × area). Check that max(abs(stress))/total_mass ≤ 0.75. Remove redundant members (e.g., member_9, member_10) if not essential for stability. All nodes must be connected.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Raise node_6 to (2.0, 2.5), move node_4 to (0.6, 1.8), node_5 to (5.4, 1.8). Compute new member lengths. For member_1, increase area to \'4\' (3.128). Other stressed members (e.g., member_2) can use area \'2\' or \'1\'. Estimate max stress reduction by increased height and area. Calculate total mass: member_1 (length ≈ 2.0, area 3.128), others (shorter, area 0.195 or 0.782). Sum all. Estimate new stress-to-weight ratio using reduced max stress (expect ~10% drop from geometry, plus area increase). Ensure ratio ≤ 0.75 and mass < 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Check that all nodes are connected. No isolated nodes. All supports/loads are unchanged. Remove redundant members (member_9, member_10). Confirm that the structure is closed. Confirm that the stress-to-weight ratio estimate is below 0.75 and total mass is well below 30.
