Objective: minimize stress-to-weight ratio (max(abs(stress))/total_weight), keeping all constraints satisfied.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes are given, all on the x-axis: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0). Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller, node_3 roller. Load at node_3: (-15, -30) kN. Constraints: truss must be closed (all nodes connected), stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 0.75, total mass ≤ 30. Only specified area IDs allowed. No prior design exists.",\n    \n    "analysis": "With all nodes collinear, a basic triangle is not possible. To create a stable, closed truss, at least one node must be moved off the line. Adding a single node above the x-axis forms a triangle, enabling triangulation and efficient load transfer. Supports at both ends and at node_3 (all rollers except node_1) allow horizontal and vertical reactions. The load at node_3 is not aligned with any member, so diagonal members are needed for efficient force resolution. Failure modes: buckling or yielding in compression members, excessive stress in tension members. Efficiency is maximized by short, direct load paths and minimal member lengths.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key insight: move a node above the x-axis, ideally above node_3 for symmetry and direct load path. Place new node_4 at (2.0, 2.8), forming two triangles: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_3-node_2-node_4. This keeps all member lengths short and distributes load efficiently. All nodes are now part of a single closed structure.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation is essential for stability. Placing node_4 above node_3 creates two strong triangles and allows direct transmission of the vertical and horizontal components of the load at node_3. Using minimal area for top chord (tension), and slightly larger area for diagonals (compression), balances mass and stress. Area IDs are chosen to keep mass under 30, while satisfying stress-to-weight ratio constraint. All members are connected uniquely, and no duplicate nodes or members exist.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Steel truss, E and yield stress not specified, but stress-to-weight ratio is the key metric. Cross-sectional areas from area_id mapping. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4. Calculate member lengths using distance formula. Assign area IDs to minimize mass while keeping stress below 0.75 × total_weight. Use static equilibrium to estimate member forces: resolve load at node_3 into members meeting at node_3 (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_4). Use trigonometry for force components. Estimate stress = force/area, weight = sum(length×area).",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node positions: node_1 (0.0,0.0), node_2 (6.0,0.0), node_3 (2.0,0.0), node_4 (2.0,2.8).

Mass = 2.0×0.782 + 4.0×0.782 + 3.44×3.128 + 4.89×3.128 + 2.8×3.128 = 1.56 + 3.13 + 10.77 + 15.27 + 8.76 = 39.49 (too high).
