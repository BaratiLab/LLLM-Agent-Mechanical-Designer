The current structure is not feasible due to a high stress-to-weight ratio. The objective is to generate a closed, efficient truss meeting all constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs: 3 supports (pinned at node_1, rollers at node_2 and node_3), load at node_3 (-15, -30). Current structure is a quadrilateral with a top node (node_4), but the stress-to-weight ratio is too high (1.6551 vs 0.75 allowed), indicating overstressed members or inefficient geometry/area allocation.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current structure has a main span (node_1 to node_2), an intermediate node_3 (with load and roller), and a top node_4 forming a trapezoidal configuration. The highest member stress is -40.44 (member_4: node_1-node_3), greatly exceeding the allowed ratio. Most mass is in the longer span members (member_1: 10.554, member_2/3: 6.154), but the critical failure is in the short member connecting node_1 and node_3 (member_4), which is undersized (area_id \'1\'). The load path from node_3 is not efficiently triangulated, causing excessive force in direct members. The structure is closed, but not efficiently triangulated for the given load path. There is no redundancy, and the load at node_3 is not well distributed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Critical issue: member_4 (node_1-node_3) is overstressed and light. The top node_4 is too close to node_3, providing little height for force resolution. The current geometry is not optimal for load transfer. Need to (1) increase triangulation, (2) move node_4 higher and possibly add another top node to create a Warren or Pratt truss, (3) adjust member areas for more efficient mass allocation.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the structure as a symmetrical, triangulated truss: keep nodes with supports and loads fixed; move node_4 higher for better force triangles; add a new top node (node_5) to form a double triangle (Warren truss). This will distribute the load more efficiently and allow all members to work in tension/compression, reducing peak stresses. Assign larger areas to the most critical members along the load path, and use minimal area for non-critical members.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation is essential for efficient truss action. By raising node_4 and adding node_5 symmetrically, the load at node_3 will be split into two triangles, reducing the force in any one member. This geometry allows for better vertical force resolution and reduces the span of highly stressed members. Assigning higher area to the bottom chord where stress is expected to be highest, and minimal area elsewhere, will minimize total mass while meeting stress constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Steel, uniform allowable stress (not specified, but design for max_stress/total_mass <= 0.75). Use area_ids for member sizing. Place new node_4 at (2.5, 2.5) and node_5 at (4.5, 2.5) for symmetry and optimal triangulation. Connect all nodes to form two adjacent triangles: node_1-node_4-node_3, node_3-node_5-node_2. Bottom chord: node_1-node_3-node_2. Top chord: node_4-node_5. Diagonals: node_1-node_5, node_2-node_4. Assign area_id \'3\' (1.759) to bottom chord, \'2\' (0.782) to diagonals, \'1\' (0.195) to top chord. Estimate member lengths and calculate total mass. Estimate force distribution: load at node_3 will be shared by both triangles.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths (approx): node_1-node_3: 2.0, node_3-node_2: 4.0, node_1-node_4: sqrt(2.5^2 + 2.5^2) ≈ 3.54, node_4-node_3: sqrt(0.5^2 + 2.5^2) ≈ 2.55, node_3-node_5: sqrt(1.5^2 + 2.5^2) ≈ 2.92, node_5-node_2: sqrt(1.5^2 + 2.5^2) ≈ 2.92, node_4-node_5: 2.0, node_1-node_5: sqrt(4.5^2 + 2.5^2) ≈ 5.16, node_2-node_4: sqrt(3.5^2 + 2.5^2) ≈ 4.30. Assign areas as above. Mass = sum(length * area). Estimate max member force: load at node_3 is shared by two triangles, so no member sees full load. With triangulation, expect max force ~18-20. With mass ~18-20, stress-to-weight ratio ~1.0, but with efficient distribution and correct area assignment, can be brought below 0.75.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "All nodes and supports retained.
