The objective is to minimize the maximum stress-to-weight ratio, ensuring all nodes are part of a closed, connected structure and all constraints (stress-to-weight, total mass) are strictly satisfied.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three nodes in a near-linear arrangement, with node_3 offset between node_1 and node_2, and all with supports, the structure must efficiently transfer a significant eccentric load at node_3. The design must connect all nodes, possibly introducing a new node for triangulation and stability, while minimizing member mass and stress.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Node_1 (0,0) is pinned, node_2 (6,0) and node_3 (2,0) are rollers. The load at node_3 is (-15.0, -30.0), indicating a downward and leftward force. With all nodes supported, the structure is statically determinate but the eccentric load could induce high stresses if not properly triangulated. A simple triangle (connecting all three nodes) is the minimal closed structure, but adding a fourth node above the base (for a \'Warren\' truss configuration) can distribute forces more efficiently and reduce peak stresses.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The direct triangle (node_1, node_2, node_3) is the lightest, but will concentrate stress in the bottom chord and diagonals. Adding a node above the base (e.g., at (3,1.8)) allows for better force distribution, reducing maximum member stress and improving the stress-to-weight ratio, especially under the given load direction.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Optimal truss design under eccentric loading favors triangulation and symmetry. By adding a node above the base, the load at node_3 can be shared by more members, reducing peak forces. Placing the new node at (3.0,1.8) (roughly above node_3, forming two triangles) leverages geometry for efficient load transfer. Member areas are chosen to balance stress and mass, using larger areas where higher forces are expected (e.g., diagonals), and minimal area for less critical members.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Steel members, area IDs as per provided mapping. Calculate member lengths using distance formula. Use method of joints to estimate forces (assume vertical symmetry). Mass = sum(length × area). Estimate maximum member force (assume load at node_3 splits between diagonals to node_1 and new node_4). Choose areas to keep stress (force/area) well below constraint. Compute stress-to-weight ratio: max(abs(stress))/total_weight. Adjust area IDs to ensure total mass <= 30 and stress-to-weight <= 0.75.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node_4 placed at (3.0,1.80) for optimal triangulation. Member lengths: node_1-node_2: 6.00, node_1-node_3: 2.00, node_2-node_3: 4.00, node_1-node_4: 3.51, node_2-node_4: 3.51, node_3-node_4: 1.80. Assign area IDs: bottom chord (node_1-node_2) and diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4) get area_id \'2\' (0.782), vertical (node_3-node_4) gets area_id \'1\' (0.195), others (node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3) get area_id \'1\' (0.195). Calculate mass: (6.00+3.51+3.51)*0.782 + (2.00+4.00)*0.195 + 1.80*0.195 = 10.53*0.782 + 6.00*0.195 + 1.80*0.195 = 8.23 + 1.17 + 0.35 = 9.75. This is well below 30. Estimate max member force (worst case diagonal under load at node_3): ~sqrt(15^2+30^2)/2 ≈ 16.77. Max stress = 16.77/0.782 ≈ 21.46. Stress-to-weight ratio: 21.46/9.75 ≈ 2.20 (too high). Increase diagonal area to \'4\' (3.128): mass = (6.00+3.51+3.51)*3.128 + (2.00+4.00)*0.195 + 1.80*0.195 = 10.53*3.128 + 6.00*0.195 + 1.80*0.195 = 32.93 + 1.17 + 0.35 = 34.45 (too high). Try area_id \'3\' (1.759): mass = 10.53*1.759 + 1.17 + 0.35 = 18.51 + 1.17 + 0.35 = 20.03. Max stress = 16.77/1.759 ≈ 9.54. Stress-to-weight = 9.54/20.03 ≈ 0.48 (satisfies constraint).
