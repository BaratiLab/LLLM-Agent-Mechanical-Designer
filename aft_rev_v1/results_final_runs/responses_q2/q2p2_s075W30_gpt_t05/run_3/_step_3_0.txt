    "preamble": "The task is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio of a closed 2D truss with three supports (node_1: pinned, node_2: roller, node_3: roller) and a significant load at node_3. The current design is constraint-satisfying, but a previous structure in the history achieved a lower stress-to-weight ratio at higher mass. The goal is to further optimize stress-to-weight ratio without exceeding mass or stress constraints, while maintaining all supports and loads in their fixed positions.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: minimize max(abs(stress))/total_weight (target < 0.75), total mass < 30. Current best is 0.3037 (mass 22.59), current structure is 0.465 (mass 15.03). Must keep supports and load nodes fixed. All nodes must be connected in a closed truss.",
    
    "analysis": "The current design is efficient in weight, but its stress-to-weight ratio is higher than the best historic structure. The historic best uses slightly different node positions (nodes 4 and 5 at [2.5,2.5] and [4.5,2.5] vs current [2.6,2.7] and [4.4,2.7]), and assigns thicker members to more critical load paths (notably, member_4 and member_7 have higher area_id). The current design uses thinner members for those paths, which reduces mass but increases stress-to-weight ratio. The load at node_3 is severe and must be efficiently transferred to supports. The structure must remain closed and triangulated for stability.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "The high stress-to-weight ratio in the current design is due to thin members along critical load paths, especially member_6 (node_1-node_3) and member_7 (node_3-node_2). The historic best increases mass but distributes stress more efficiently. The node positions in the historic best are more symmetric, which may help balance forces.",
    
    "proposal": "Adopt the node geometry of the historic best (nodes 4 and 5 at [2.5,2.5] and [4.5,2.5]) to improve load distribution. Adjust member area_ids to match the historic best, particularly increasing area_ids on members directly involved in the load path from node_3 to supports. This will likely reduce the stress-to-weight ratio below the current structure, while keeping mass well below the constraint. This approach is justified because the historic best already achieves a lower stress-to-weight ratio and all constraints are met.",
    
    "reasoning": "The historic best structure demonstrates that slightly higher mass (by increasing member areas on critical paths) yields a much better stress-to-weight ratio. Triangulation is maintained, and the geometry is more symmetric, which is beneficial for force distribution. By matching the node positions and member areas of the historic best, the structure will efficiently transfer the load from node_3 to the supports with lower peak stresses. No further node movement is justified since the supports and load positions are fixed, and the historic best already explores optimal geometry within those constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All supports and load nodes are fixed. Use node positions from historic best. Use member areas from historic best. Mass = sum(length Ã— area_id_value). Stress-to-weight ratio is already calculated for historic best as 0.3037 (well below 0.75). All members are connected, closed, and no floating nodes. Confirm all constraints are satisfied.",
    
    "calculation": "Historic best: total mass = 22.59 < 30, max(abs(stress)) = 6.86, stress-to-weight ratio = 0.3037 < 0.75. Member areas and positions are optimized for load transfer and closure. No constraint violations. No further improvements are evident without violating efficiency or constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints are satisfied. The historic best is already the optimal balance between mass and stress-to-weight ratio within the given geometry and area_id options. Further mass reduction increases stress-to-weight ratio, and further area increase unnecessarily increases mass. Stop here.",
    
    "stop": "True", # The historic best structure is optimal given the constraints and objective. No further improvement is possible without violating constraints or increasing stress-to-weight ratio.
