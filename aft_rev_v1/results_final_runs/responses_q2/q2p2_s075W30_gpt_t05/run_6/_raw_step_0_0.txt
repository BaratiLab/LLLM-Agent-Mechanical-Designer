The goal is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio (max(abs(stress))/total_weight) while ensuring a closed, fully connected truss and satisfying all constraints: stress-to-weight <= 0.75, total mass <= 30, and all nodes connected. Area selection must use only specified discrete values.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three nodes in a straight line at (0,0), (2,0), (6,0), with supports at both ends and the middle, and a load at the middle. The truss must be closed (all nodes connected). The trivial straight connection is statically determinate but weak in vertical load transfer; triangulation is needed for efficiency and to reduce stress. Additional nodes may be added for optimal triangulation and load path.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The load at node_3 is (-15, -30), which acts down and left. The supports are: node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 (roller). A straight-line truss would be a mechanism (unstable). Triangulation is essential. Adding an upper node above node_3, forming two triangles, will allow for effective vertical load transfer and reduce maximum member stress. Optimal area selection must balance member force and total mass. All members must be referenced by unique, existing nodes. The structure must be closed (no isolated nodes).",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "With only three colinear nodes, the only way to make a closed, triangulated truss is to add a fourth node above the base line. By placing this node above node_3, we can connect all base nodes to it, forming two triangles. This provides both stability and efficient load transfer. Stress will be highest in the diagonals. Area selection should be smallest possible while meeting stress-to-weight and mass constraints.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 2.5), directly above node_3, to minimize member length and provide effective vertical load transfer. Connect node_4 to all three base nodes, creating two triangles. This ensures a closed, fully triangulated truss. All nodes are connected, and the load at node_3 will be efficiently shared among the diagonals and vertical. Area selection: use the smallest area that keeps max(abs(stress))/total_weight <= 0.75 and total mass <= 30. Start with area_id \'4\' (A=3.128) for diagonals/vertical, \'1\' (A=0.195) for shorter base members.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume E=200 GPa (irrelevant for stress-to-weight), density=1 (unitless for ratio). Member lengths: base (node_1-node_3: 2.0), (node_3-node_2: 4.0), diagonals (sqrt(2.5^2 + 2^2) ≈ 3.20), (sqrt(2.5^2 + 4^2) ≈ 4.72), vertical (2.5). Calculate member forces from statics (vertical load at node_3 shared by diagonals and vertical). Estimate max force, select area to keep stress low. Total mass: sum(length × area). Check constraints.

Assign area_id \'1\' (0.195) to base members, \'4\' (3.128) to diagonals/vertical. Total mass = 2.0*0.195 + 4.0*0.195 + 3.20*3.128 + 2.5*3.128 + 4.72*3.128 = 0.39+0.78+10.01+7.82+14.76=33.76 (exceeds 30).

Max force (estimate): assume vertical at node_3 is shared equally by diagonals and vertical. Each takes ~-10 units. Max stress = 10/1.759=5.68. Stress-to-weight = 5.68/19.50=0.29 (<0.75).
