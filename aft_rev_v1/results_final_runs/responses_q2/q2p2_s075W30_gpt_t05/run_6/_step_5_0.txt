    "preamble": "The task is to optimize a 2D truss structure for minimum stress-to-weight ratio, ensuring all constraints (stress-to-weight ≤ 0.75, mass ≤ 30) are met. The current design is feasible, with a low stress-to-weight ratio (0.1806) and total mass (22.86), but further optimization is sought.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "The structure is stable and constraint-satisfying. The main objective is to reduce the stress-to-weight ratio further, if possible, by redistributing material or refining geometry without violating constraints or moving fixed nodes.",
    
    "analysis": "The current structure uses a compact, triangulated arrangement with six nodes and ten members, efficiently distributing load from node_3 (with a significant downward and leftward force) to the supports at nodes 1, 2, and 3. The main load path is from node_3 through members 1 and 2 (with larger area IDs for strength). The rest of the members use smaller cross-sections to maintain stability and closure. Generation history shows that alternative, less triangulated structures or fewer nodes yield much higher stress-to-weight ratios and often violate constraints. The current design is already the best among those explored.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: (1) Triangulation and material concentration near loaded/support nodes are crucial; (2) Reducing member areas or removing members risks constraint violation. (3) Most members are already at minimal area or length. (4) Node positions for supports and loads are fixed. Only possible minor improvement: slightly adjust internal node positions (nodes 4, 5, 6) to minimize member lengths or further balance force flows.",
    
    "proposal": "Retain the overall topology (nodes and connectivity) of the current best design, but fine-tune the positions of nodes 4, 5, and 6 to slightly shorten member lengths and potentially reduce mass while preserving triangulation and closure. All area assignments and member connections remain as in the current design, as historic alternatives are inferior.",
    
    "reasoning": "The current structure is close to optimal: it is fully triangulated, uses minimal area for non-critical members, and has no isolated nodes. By nudging the positions of the internal nodes (nodes 4, 5, 6) slightly downward and inward, member lengths and thus total mass can be reduced, possibly yielding a marginally better stress-to-weight ratio. This leverages geometric efficiency without compromising stability.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: (1) Members 1 and 2 must remain thickest to carry the main load; (2) Members 3-10 can remain at minimal area. (3) Small inward movement of nodes 4, 5, and 6 (closer to node_3 and to each other) will reduce overall member length. Calculations: Recalculate node positions for 4, 5, 6 by reducing their y-coordinates by 0.2 and bringing x-coordinates slightly toward the center. Check that closure and triangulation remain. Estimate mass using new member lengths; stress should not increase significantly due to retained topology.",
    
    "calculation": "Adjust node_4 from (2.0, 2.8) → (2.1, 2.6), node_5 from (4.0, 2.8) → (3.9, 2.6), node_6 from (3.0, 3.4) → (3.0, 3.2). All members remain connected as before. Estimate member lengths: all slightly reduced. Total mass likely decreases by ~2-3%. Stress distribution remains similar since topology and load paths are unchanged. Estimated new total mass: ~22.2. Max stress remains ~4.13. New stress-to-weight ratio: 4.13/22.2 ≈ 0.186 (still well below constraints).",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints remain satisfied. Structure remains closed, triangulated, and efficient. No further significant improvements possible without risking constraint violation or instability. Ready to output optimized structure.",
    
    "stop": "True # No further meaningful optimization possible: the structure is already highly efficient, constraint-satisfying, and further reduction would risk violating constraints or stability.",
