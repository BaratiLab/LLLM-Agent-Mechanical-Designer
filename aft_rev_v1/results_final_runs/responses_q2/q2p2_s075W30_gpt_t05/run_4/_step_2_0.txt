    "preamble": "The task is to optimize a 2D truss structure with fixed node positions for supports and loads, aiming to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio and total mass while strictly satisfying structural constraints. The current and past designs violate the stress-to-weight constraint. The goal is a closed, efficient truss that meets all requirements.",

    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs specify three support nodes (pinned at node_1, rollers at node_2 and node_3) and a load at node_3. Previous designs used five nodes, but all failed the stress-to-weight ratio constraint (target ≤ 0.75, current best ≈2.13). Mass constraints are less critical (all designs so far are <30).",

    "analysis": "The load at node_3 (downward and leftward) is large relative to the truss scale, causing high stress in nearby members (notably member_2). Both prior structures use a central elevated node or two, but the stress is concentrated in members directly connected to node_3. The truss is over-complicated, with many members and nodes, but stress remains high due to inefficient force paths and possibly long, slender members with small areas. The structure is closed but not optimally triangulated for efficient load transfer. The member areas are mostly small (area_id '1', '2'), which increases stress. The high vertical load at node_3 is poorly distributed to both supports.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Key issues: (1) Members near node_3 are overstressed, (2) current geometry is not efficiently transferring load to supports, (3) too many members with small areas, (4) lack of direct, short load paths. A simpler, more direct triangulation is needed. Increasing member areas only where needed will reduce stress without excessive mass gain.",

    "proposal": "Redesign for efficiency: Use only the required nodes (nodes with supports/loads) and a single elevated apex node to form a classic triangular truss. Connect node_3 directly to both supports and to the apex; connect apex to both supports. Use larger area members only where high stress is expected (members from node_3 to apex and supports). Remove unnecessary members/nodes. This layout is the most efficient for transferring concentrated loads to supports in a planar truss.",

    "reasoning": "A minimal, symmetric triangle (nodes 1, 2, 3 at base, apex node_4 above node_3) will direct the load at node_3 efficiently to both supports via short, direct members. Triangulation ensures no long, slender, overstressed members. The apex node's height is chosen to balance vertical and horizontal force components. Large area members are used for the most heavily loaded elements (node_3 to apex, apex to supports). This reduces max stress and stress-to-weight ratio. All nodes are connected, forming a closed truss.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All supports and load nodes remain fixed. Place apex node_4 at (3.0, h), where h is chosen to optimize load path (h ≈ 2.0–3.0). Members: node_1–node_2 (base), node_1–node_4, node_2–node_4 (legs), node_3–node_4 (vertical), node_1–node_3, node_2–node_3 (short diagonals). Use area_id '3' (1.759) for highly loaded legs and vertical, '1' (0.195) for base and diagonals. Calculate member lengths, estimate forces using method of joints for a typical triangular truss under off-center load. Estimate mass and stress-to-weight ratio. Adjust h and area selections as needed.",

    "calculation": "Let node_1 = (0.0, 0.0), node_2 = (6.0, 0.0), node_3 = (2.0, 0.0), apex node_4 = (3.0, 2.4). Member lengths: base = 6.0, legs ≈ sqrt(3^2 + 2.4^2) ≈ 3.84, vertical = 2.4, diagonals ≈ sqrt(2^2 + 2.4^2) ≈ 3.12. Assign area_id: base (1), legs (3), vertical (3), diagonals (1). Mass = sum(length × area): 6.0×0.195 + 3.84×1.759×2 + 2.4×1.759 + 3.12×0.195×2 ≈ 1.17 + 13.51 + 4.22 + 1.22 ≈ 20.12. Max force in vertical/legs estimated at ~2×load magnitude (worst case): 30–40. Stress = force/area ≈ 40/1.759 ≈ 22.7. Stress-to-weight = 22.7/20.12 ≈ 1.13. Still over, so increase area_id to '4' (3.128) for legs/vertical. New mass: 3.84×3.128×2 + 2.4×3.128 ≈ 24.03, stress ≈ 40/3.128 ≈ 12.8, stress-to-weight ≈ 0.53. Now both constraints met.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "Final design: Four nodes, six members, all nodes connected. Area_id '4' for high-stress members, '1' for others. Geometry ensures efficient load transfer and minimal weight. All constraints satisfied: stress-to-weight ratio ≈ 0.53 < 0.75, mass ≈ 24.03 < 30. Node positions precise, no unnecessary nodes or members. Valid closed truss.",
