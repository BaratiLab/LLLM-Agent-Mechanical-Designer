    "preamble": "This problem requires the design of a closed, fully-connected 2D truss using three fixed nodes, with the goal of minimizing the stress-to-weight ratio while keeping total mass and stress-to-weight within strict limits. The truss must safely support a significant off-axis load at node_3, with pinned and roller supports at the base. The design must be efficient, stable, and satisfy all constraints in a single shot.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "With three nodes given and a significant load at node_3, an optimal truss requires triangulation for stability. The supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) suggest a classic statically determinate truss. To minimize stress-to-weight, member areas should be chosen to balance force distribution and mass. All nodes must be interconnected to close the structure.",
    
    "analysis": "The load at node_3 (-15.0, -30.0) is both horizontal and vertical, creating a strong moment and requiring both horizontal and vertical resistance. The geometry is a triangle: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0) — all on the x-axis. With all nodes collinear, a simple triangle is degenerate and cannot resist out-of-plane forces. To form a closed, stable truss, a new node must be introduced above the x-axis, creating a true triangle. This will allow for triangulation and effective force transfer. The structure must be as light as possible, so member lengths and areas must be minimized and balanced.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Collinear nodes cannot provide a closed, stable truss. Introducing a single new node above the x-axis at the centroid (or near it) will allow triangulation. Placing the new node at (2.5, 2.5) creates two triangles and ensures all nodes are connected. The member areas must be carefully selected for balance: larger where force is highest, smaller elsewhere. The load path from node_3 will primarily go to the new node and then to the supports.",
    
    "reasoning": "For maximum efficiency and stability, the new node (node_4) is placed above the x-axis at (2.5, 2.5), forming two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4). All nodes are interconnected directly or via node_4, ensuring closure. Members connecting node_3 to node_4, and node_4 to node_1 and node_2, take the major load. Direct chords from node_1 to node_2 and node_1 to node_3 provide redundancy and direct load paths. Member areas are chosen based on estimated force magnitudes using static equilibrium and geometry, prioritizing heavier members for high-force paths and lighter for others, all within the mass constraint.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume: All members are steel, E and density are uniform and not needed for this step. Calculate member lengths using distance formula. Estimate force in each member using method of joints (approximate, as this is a single-shot). Assign area IDs to keep total mass under 30 units and stress-to-weight ratio under 0.75. Members directly supporting the applied load (node_3 to node_4, node_4 to supports) get higher area IDs. Chords get moderate or minimal area IDs. Calculate total mass as sum(length × area). Calculate max(abs(stress)) using F/A for each member, using estimated joint force balance. Compute stress-to-weight ratio.",
    
    "calculation": "Node positions: node_1 (0.0,0.0), node_2 (6.0,0.0), node_3 (2.0,0.0), node_4 (2.5,2.5). Member lengths: node_1-node_2: 6.00, node_1-node_3: 2.00, node_2-node_3: 4.00, node_3-node_4: sqrt((2.5-2.0)^2+(2.5-0.0)^2)=2.55, node_1-node_4: sqrt((2.5-0.0)^2+(2.5-0.0)^2)=3.54, node_2-node_4: sqrt((6.0-2.5)^2+(0.0-2.5)^2)=4.30. Assign area IDs: node_3-node_4: '4' (3.128), node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4: '3' (1.759), node_1-node_2: '1' (0.195), node_1-node_3: '1' (0.195), node_2-node_3: '1' (0.195). Total mass = 6.00*0.195 + 2.00*0.195 + 4.00*0.195 + 2.55*3.128 + 3.54*1.759 + 4.30*1.759 ≈ 1.17 + 0.39 + 0.78 + 7.98 + 6.22 + 7.57 = 24.11. Estimated max member force (node_3-node_4, primary load path): assume 33.54 (from sqrt(15^2 + 30^2)). Stress = 33.54/3.128 ≈ 10.73. Stress-to-weight ratio = 10.73/24.11 ≈ 0.445 < 0.75. All constraints are satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "All nodes are connected, forming a closed, triangulated truss. The mass and stress-to-weight ratio are within constraints. The new node placement ensures stability and direct load paths. All members reference unique nodes, with no duplicates. The design is minimal and efficient.",
