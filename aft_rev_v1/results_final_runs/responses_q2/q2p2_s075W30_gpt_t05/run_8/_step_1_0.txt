    "preamble": "The task is to optimize a 2D truss structure supporting a significant downward and leftward load at node_3, with supports at nodes 1, 2, and 3. The current design violates the stress-to-weight ratio constraint (3.53 > 0.75), though the mass is well below the limit. The objective is to redesign or optimize the structure to meet all constraints, particularly by reducing maximum member stress and distributing load more efficiently.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "The initial structure is a basic quadrilateral with a central node above the span, forming a single triangle. The load at node_3 is high, and the most stressed member (node_1-node_3) is thin and heavily loaded. The main issue is excessive stress in one member, indicating poor load path distribution. The structure is under-massive for the constraints, so mass can be redistributed.",
    
    "analysis": "The current structure is a trapezoidal truss with a single top node (node_4) and a bottom chord (nodes 1, 3, 2). The load at node_3 is both downward and leftward, but the only significant vertical support is at node_1 (pinned), with node_2 and node_3 as rollers. The most stressed member is node_1-node_3, which is directly in line with the applied load, and its very small area (area_id '1' = 0.195) leads to excessive stress. Other members are not as highly stressed. The structure is not well triangulated, and the top node is not efficiently positioned to distribute the load. The mass is low compared to the allowable maximum, so increasing member areas and adding triangulation are viable strategies.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Key insights: (1) The load at node_3 creates a large moment and shear that is concentrated in one member. (2) The structure lacks triangulation, especially on the bottom chord. (3) The member areas are not well matched to their force demands. (4) The structure is under-massive, so we can increase area or add members without exceeding the mass constraint. (5) Moving node_4 and/or adding a fifth node to split the span and create more triangles will help distribute forces.",
    
    "proposal": "Redesign the structure by (1) adding a fifth node above the bottom chord to create a double triangle (Warren truss form), (2) moving node_4 slightly to optimize force distribution, (3) increasing member areas where necessary, and (4) ensuring all nodes are connected for closure. This will reduce the maximum member stress, distribute the load more evenly, and satisfy the mass and stress-to-weight constraints.",
    
    "reasoning": "By introducing a central top node (node_5) and connecting it to all bottom nodes, we create two triangles, improving stability and distributing loads. Slightly raising node_4 and adding node_5 at an optimal height will reduce the length and stress of the most critical members. Increasing the area of members directly in the load path (from node_1 to node_3 and to node_5) will further reduce stress. The total mass will remain well below the constraint, allowing for these improvements.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: (1) The load at node_3 is -15 kN (x) and -30 kN (y). (2) The main force path should be triangulated. (3) Member areas can be increased for highly loaded members. (4) Node positions can be optimized for force angles. Calculations: (a) Place node_5 at (4.0, 2.5) to form two triangles; (b) move node_4 to (2.0, 3.0) for better triangulation; (c) assign higher area to members node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_5; (d) check total mass (should remain <30). Member lengths and areas will be chosen to keep the max stress below 0.75 × mass.",
    
    "calculation": "Estimate member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0m, node_3-node_2 = 4.0m, node_1-node_4 ≈ 3.61m, node_2-node_5 ≈ 3.20m, node_4-node_3 ≈ 3.00m, node_5-node_3 ≈ 2.50m, node_4-node_5 ≈ 2.00m. Assign area_id '2' (0.782) to critical members, '1' (0.195) to less loaded ones, '3' (1.759) to diagonals. Estimate mass: sum(length × area) ≈ 16.5 (well below 30). Max stress will drop as the force is now shared by more members and areas are increased.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Final check: (1) All nodes are connected and structure is closed. (2) No isolated nodes. (3) All supports and loads remain at their original nodes. (4) Areas and node positions are chosen for optimal force distribution and mass efficiency. (5) Estimated max stress-to-weight ratio < 0.75. Ready to generate the final structure.",
