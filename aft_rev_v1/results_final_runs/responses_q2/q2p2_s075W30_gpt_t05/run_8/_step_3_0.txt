    "preamble": "The task is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio of a closed 2D truss structure under a load at node_3, with pinned and roller supports at nodes 1, 2, and 3. The current design is constraint-satisfying and already efficient, but further improvement is sought within the constraints: stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 0.75 and total mass ≤ 30.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs confirm all constraints are currently satisfied. The best design (iteration 2) uses strong bottom chords (area_id '4') and smaller diagonals/verticals. The load at node_3 is significant and off-center, so the top chord and web must efficiently transfer force to the supports.",
    
    "analysis": "The current truss is a compact, closed, double-triangle configuration with a central vertical. The largest members (area_id '4') are along the bottom, where the highest axial force is expected. Diagonals and verticals use smaller areas, minimizing weight. FEM shows max stress = 4.11, total mass = 26.97, and stress-to-weight ratio = 0.1524 (well within constraint). History shows that reducing mass further (with less redundancy or smaller members) causes constraint violations. The structure is already highly optimized, with stress distributed well among members and no excessive overdesign.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: The bottom chord must remain robust due to high horizontal and vertical load at node_3. The current node layout is compact, minimizing member length. The web is triangulated, and all nodes are connected. Any further reduction in member area or length risks violating stress constraints. The only possible improvement might be slight node repositioning to further equalize member lengths and stress, but gains are likely marginal.",
    
    "proposal": "Fine-tune node_4 and node_5 positions to make the triangles more equilateral, reducing peak member stress without adding weight. Slightly raise node_6 (apex) to better distribute vertical load. Keep all supports and loaded nodes fixed. Maintain the same member topology and areas for proven efficiency.",
    
    "reasoning": "By making the triangles more equilateral and slightly raising the top node, force paths are shortened and force distribution is improved. This should marginally reduce the peak member stress, possibly lowering the stress-to-weight ratio further. The current member areas are already close to optimal, so no area reduction is proposed. All design changes preserve connectivity and closure.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members are pin-jointed, load is static, and only axial forces are present. Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Adjust node_4 and node_5 horizontally inward by 0.1, and raise node_6 by 0.1. Recalculate member lengths for mass. Use existing area_ids. Approximate that these tweaks will slightly reduce the maximum force in the most loaded member. Confirm total mass remains <30 and that stress-to-weight ratio is not increased.",
    
    "calculation": "node_4 moves to (1.10, 1.60), node_5 to (2.90, 1.60), node_6 to (2.00, 2.60). Members are recalculated for length, but areas remain as in the current best design. Estimated mass is slightly reduced due to shorter diagonals. Peak stress is marginally reduced by more even force distribution. New stress-to-weight ratio is estimated at ~0.150, total mass ~26.8. All constraints are met.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Design is closed, all nodes connected, and all constraints are satisfied. No further meaningful optimization is possible without risking constraint violations or structural inefficiency. The design remains robust and efficient.",
    
    "stop": "True", # The current structure is already highly efficient, and further modifications yield only marginal improvements. The stress-to-weight ratio and mass are both well below constraints, and the structure is robust. Stopping here is justified.
