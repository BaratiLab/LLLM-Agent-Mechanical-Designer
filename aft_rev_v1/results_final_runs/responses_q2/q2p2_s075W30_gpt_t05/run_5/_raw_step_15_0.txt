Current and historic designs either exceed the stress-to-weight ratio or are inefficient in mass. The goal is to achieve a feasible, efficient, closed truss structure.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Input: 3 supported nodes (node_1: pinned, node_2: roller, node_3: roller), 1 loaded node (node_3: -15, -30), 2 free nodes (node_4, node_5). Constraints: stress-to-weight ratio ≤0.75, total mass ≤30. Current and historic structures are over-stressed or overweight. Must maintain load/support node positions.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current and historic best structures show a pattern: either mass is excessive (historic rank_1,2: mass~24.5, ratio~0.56) or stress-to-weight ratio is too high (current: 1.18, mass~12.1). Most historic attempts cluster nodes close to the loaded node and use dense triangulation, but member sizing is not optimal. The loaded node (node_3) is at (2.0, 0.0), with a large downward load. The supports are spread at (0.0, 0.0), (6.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0). The upper nodes (node_4, node_5) are used for triangulation but not optimally placed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The most efficient structures use a Warren or Pratt truss configuration, minimizing member redundancy and maximizing triangulation. The current node_5 is too high, increasing member lengths and mass. Lowering node_5, and moving node_4 slightly up and right, could reduce both stress and mass, while keeping triangles compact. Using minimal area members for less stressed diagonals, and larger area for high-force chords, will further optimize.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss by lowering node_5 and moving node_4 up and right, forming a compact, symmetric, closed truss with all nodes connected. Use minimal area for diagonals, moderate for chords. Keep all load/support nodes fixed. Use five nodes for simplicity and efficiency.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A compact, symmetric truss distributes loads evenly and minimizes peak stresses. Triangulation reduces member length and increases stiffness. Lowering the top node (node_5) reduces vertical member forces. Moving node_4 right increases the angle of diagonals, lowering their force. Assigning area based on expected member force (chords > diagonals > verticals) will keep mass low and stress-to-weight ratio within limits.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Steel truss, all nodes except supports/load can be repositioned. Member forces estimated by geometry and load path. Mass = Σ(length × area). Stress = force / area. Select area_id: chords (\'2\'), diagonals (\'1\'), verticals (\'1\'). Node_5 lowered to 3.0, node_4 at (4.0, 2.0). Diagonals use area_id \'1\', chords area_id \'2\'. Members form triangles between all adjacent nodes.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Estimate member lengths: base chord (node_1-node_2) = 6.0; node_1-node_5 ≈ 3.61; node_2-node_5 ≈ 3.61; node_3-node_5 ≈ 3.61; node_3-node_4 ≈ 2.83; node_4-node_5 ≈ 2.24; node_1-node_3 = 2.0; node_2-node_4 ≈ 2.83. Assign areas: base chord/loaded chord = \'2\' (0.782), diagonals/verticals = \'1\' (0.195). Mass ≈ (6.0+2.0+2.83+3.61+3.61+2.24+2.83+3.61) × respective areas ≈ 11.8. Max stress, estimated by equilibrium and geometry, should be <9.0, giving ratio ≈ 0.76. To reduce further, increase area_id for most loaded member (node_1-node_3) to \'3\' (1.759), lowering max stress and ratio to ≈0.68.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "All nodes are connected, no isolated points.
