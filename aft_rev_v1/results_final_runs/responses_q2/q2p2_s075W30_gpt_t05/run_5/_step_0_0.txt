    "preamble": "This is a single-shot structural optimization of a 2D truss with three given nodes, one significant off-axis load, and three supports (pinned/roller). The objective is to design a minimal-mass, closed truss structure that minimizes the stress-to-weight ratio, ensuring max(abs(stress))/total_weight <= 0.75 and total mass <= 30, using only allowed discrete area IDs. All nodes must be fully connected.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given: nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0). Supports: pinned at node_1, roller at node_2 and node_3. Load: (-15,-30) at node_3. Objective: robust, triangulated, minimal-weight structure. Constraints: stress-to-weight ratio <= 0.75, mass <= 30, all nodes connected. Areas restricted to discrete set.",
    
    "analysis": "With all three nodes collinear on the x-axis, a direct triangle is not possible. The load at node_3 is large and off-axis, requiring vertical and horizontal resistance. To create a closed, triangulated truss, a new node above the x-axis is needed. The optimal location is above node_3, forming a triangle with node_1 and node_2, distributing the load efficiently. All supports are at the base, so a vertical or steeply inclined member from node_3 to the new node will directly resist vertical load. Triangulation will ensure stability and distribute forces.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Key insight: add a node above the x-axis (say, node_4 at (2,2.6)) to form two triangles: (node_1, node_2, node_4) and (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4). This configuration efficiently channels the applied load and minimizes bending. Area selection must balance mass and stress—choose the smallest area that satisfies constraints. The load is significant, so avoid undersizing.",
    
    "reasoning": "Triangulation is essential for stability and minimal mass. Placing node_4 above node_3 (at (2,2.6)) creates optimal load paths: node_3's load can be resisted by a steep member to node_4, which then transfers to the base nodes. All nodes are now part of a single closed structure. Members are chosen to be as short as possible while effectively resisting applied forces. Member areas are selected to ensure stresses are below allowable limits and total mass is minimized.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All members are pin-jointed, loads are static, and material is uniform. Calculate member lengths, estimate internal forces using static equilibrium (joint method), then compute stresses (force/area) and total mass (sum of length*area). Select area IDs iteratively to ensure constraints. For load path, the vertical component on node_3 is resisted by member (node_3, node_4), and node_4 distributes to node_1 and node_2. For initial sizing, use area_id '4' (A=3.128) for steepest loaded members, area_id '2' (A=0.782) for less loaded ones. Iterate as needed.",
    
    "calculation": "Node positions: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (2,2.6). Member lengths: (node_1,node_2)=6.00, (node_1,node_4)=3.33, (node_2,node_4)=4.33, (node_3,node_4)=2.60, (node_1,node_3)=2.00, (node_2,node_3)=4.00. Assign areas: (node_3,node_4) and (node_1,node_4) get area_id '4' (A=3.128) for high vertical load; others get area_id '2' (A=0.782). Estimate max member force at node_3: |F| ≈ sqrt(15^2+30^2)=33.54, so stress in (node_3,node_4) ≈ 33.54/3.128 = 10.73. Total weight = sum(length*area): 6*0.782 + 3.33*3.128 + 4.33*0.782 + 2.6*3.128 + 2*0.782 + 4*0.782 = 4.692 + 10.41 + 3.39 + 8.13 + 1.56 + 3.13 = 31.21. Slightly over mass, so reduce area_id for less loaded members to '1' (A=0.195). New total weight: (6+4.33+2+4)*0.195 + (3.33+2.6)*3.128 = 3.16 + 18.51 = 21.67. Max stress-to-weight ratio: 10.73/21.67 = 0.50 < 0.75. All constraints met.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Design uses four nodes, six members (fully triangulated). Area IDs chosen for minimal mass and safe stress. All nodes are connected, constraints satisfied: stress-to-weight ratio 0.50, mass 21.67 < 30. Members sized based on load path analysis. No duplicate nodes/members. Ready for output.",
