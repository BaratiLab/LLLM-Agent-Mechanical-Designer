The current structure and recent history violate the stress-to-weight ratio constraint (must be <= 0.75) and, in some cases, approach mass limits. The objective is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio and mass, while ensuring all nodes are structurally connected and all constraints are met.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given: 3 support nodes (node_1: pinned, node_2 & node_3: roller), a concentrated load at node_3 (-15, -30), and a history of designs. All recent designs fail the stress-to-weight ratio constraint, often due to excessive force in a few members (notably node_1-node_3 in current). The best historic design (rank_1) meets the stress constraint but is not optimal in mass. All nodes must remain at their current positions if they have loads/supports.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current structure\'s main failure is a highly overstressed member (node_1-node_3, stress ~-48), causing a stress-to-weight ratio of 3.16, far above the 0.75 limit. Previous attempts to move node_4 or node_5 vertically resulted in marginal improvement, but the stress in certain members (especially those connecting supports to the loaded node) remains high. The best historic structure (rank_1) achieves a stress-to-weight ratio of 0.73, just under the constraint, but at a higher mass (18.6). This design uses a more triangulated, symmetric layout. Many failed designs tried to minimize mass but ended up with overstressed members. The main issue is the force path from node_3 (load) to the supports; direct links from node_3 to node_1 or node_2 tend to concentrate force and induce high stress unless adequately triangulated or reinforced. The load at node_3 is significant and must be distributed through multiple paths. A more efficient triangulation, possibly with an additional node above node_3, could distribute forces better.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Overstressed direct members from loaded node to supports. Triangulation and spreading load paths via intermediate nodes (above node_3) lower peak stresses. Adding a node above node_3 (not a support or load node) can help split the vertical force into two inclined members, reducing force in any one member. Previous best design (rank_1) is close to feasible, but mass is high due to conservative member sizing. A lighter, more efficient triangulation may permit reduction of member area while maintaining acceptable stress. Keeping node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed, and optimizing node_4/node_5 positions, plus potentially adding a new node above node_3, is promising.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign: Retain node_1, node_2, node_3 at their fixed positions. Place node_4 directly above node_3 (height 3.2 for good force splitting, based on load magnitude), and node_5 midway between node_3 and node_2 but raised (to help triangulate the right side). Add a sixth node, node_6, above and between node_1 and node_3 to assist with load distribution. Use minimal member areas (area_id \'1\') for most members; increase to \'2\' only if a member is likely to see high force (e.g., directly under the load). Connect all nodes into a closed, triangulated network, ensuring all are structurally connected.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Symmetry and triangulation are key. The load at node_3 should be split upward to node_4 and node_6, then distributed to supports via inclined members. This reduces the force in any single member and prevents overstressing. Adding node_5 on the right triangulates the span, further distributing forces. By using more triangles and avoiding long, direct spans from node_3 to supports, we reduce peak member forces. Member areas are chosen to keep mass low but ensure safety in high-force members.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All supports and load nodes fixed. Member area selection: use area_id \'1\' (0.195) for most, \'2\' (0.782) for high-force paths. Node_4 at (2.0, 3.2) above node_3, node_5 at (4.0, 1.6) to the right and up, node_6 at (1.0, 2.2) above and left. Members: connect node_3 to node_4, node_4 to node_6 and node_5, node_6 to node_1 and node_3, node_5 to node_2 and node_4, node_1 to node_2, node_1 to node_3, node_2 to node_3. Mass = sum(length × area). Estimate: total member length ~30–35, mostly area 0.195, a few at 0.782, so mass ≈ 8–12.
