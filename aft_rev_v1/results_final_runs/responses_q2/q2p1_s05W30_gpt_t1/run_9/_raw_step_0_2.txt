The goal is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio, keeping it ≤0.5, while not exceeding a total truss mass of 30 units. The design should ensure all structural constraints are met, balancing force equilibrium, load path directness, and triangulation for stiffness and stress distribution.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three colinear nodes at (0,0), (6,0), and (2,0), with a downward and leftward load at \'node_3\', supports at each node (pinned at \'node_1\', rollers elsewhere). Must create a fully triangulated, closed truss, possibly via extra node addition, and choose efficient cross-sectional areas. The truss must connect all nodes and ensure robust path for the eccentric load on \'node_3\'.",\n    \n    "analysis": "With all three nodes on the x-axis, and the primary load at the intermediate node, the truss as given would be unstable (degenerate configuration), both geometrically and structurally. Adding at least one new non-colinear node is necessary to enable a triangulated closed truss and fully develop tension/compression load paths. Direct triangles from loaded node to supports, with a fourth node placed above the x-axis, will balance the vertical and horizontal load components. Triangulation will efficiently transfer loads and minimize stress.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Colinearity is a critical concern; without additional nodes, members would coincide. Adding a single apex node above (2.0,0.0)—for instance at (2.0,2.4)—allows for an isosceles triangle, efficiently resolving the applied forces. Using minimal yet sufficient area sections will help satisfy the mass and stress constraints. Focused truss: four nodes, five members (full closed triangle plus internal member for full connectivity).",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Adding \'node_4\' at (2.0,2.4) creates a triangle between all supports and connections; this enables direct transmission of both vertical and horizontal force components from \'node_3\' to the supports. Full triangulation avoids instability and excessive member forces. Member area selection will favor the lightest areas that still maintain stress below the 0.5 stress-to-weight threshold.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume members are pin-jointed. Use small area_id for most members, larger only if high stress expected. Member forces determined by equilibrium at joints. Estimate masses via member lengths × area. Compute maximum member stress given load at node_3. Calculate stress-to-weight ratio = max_member_stress / total_mass. All members must be connected, members: (1-3), (2-3), (1-2), (1-4), (2-4), (3-4). Try smallest possible areas that support load, consider increasing where stress constraints violated. Unit area for area_id=0 is 1.0, others as per table; mass = length × area for each member, sum for total.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node locations set: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2,2.4).

Compute forces at node_3 under 33.5kN resultant load (sqrt(−15²+−30²)), distribute to triangle; maximal axial in vertical or diagonal member, approx 33.5kN. Max stress = 33.5/0.782 = 42.86 units; mass = sum(length×area). Suppose member (3-4) needs larger area; try area_id=\'4\' (A=3.128): 33.5/3.128=10.71, mass increases but still small compared to cap.
