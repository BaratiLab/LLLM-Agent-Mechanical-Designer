The current and historical attempts have failed constraint checks—in particular, stress-to-weight ratio < 0.5 and total mass < 30 kg. We must reconfigure the truss, using the minimum needed nodes/members, while keeping the position and type of loaded and supported nodes fixed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes 1, 2, and 3 define the main span, with nodes 4, 5, 6 above forming upper chords. The latest solution has a modest stress-to-weight ratio (0.1928) but is too massive (35.43 > 30). Previous, lighter solutions exceeded allowable stress. Aim: reduce mass by limiting upper nodes/members and minimizing heavy/large member areas, while maintaining load path and support integrity.",\n\n    "analysis": "The load at node_3 (-15, -30) is substantial and not colinear with any lower chord. The support conditions are: node_1 (pinned), node_2, and node_3 (rollers). The last structure is heavily triangulated but overbuilt for the task, resulting in excessive mass. Lightest historic solutions fail by exceeding member stress limits, notably in lower longitudinal members, likely due to direct load transfer without sufficient division. Key: Efficient load path and triangulation for stability, with minimal but adequate area allocation. The triangle between node_1, node_3, node_2 is essential. Raising an upper node above node_3 (as in node_4) should help resolve vertical loads efficiently. The extra upper node_5 and node_6, and multi-way bracing are unnecessary and costly in weight for the modest stress reduction they produce.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "The structure can be trimmed by removing node_6 and consolidating the upper chord (node_4) to form a simple Warren truss—triangular, with diagonals directing force away from node_3. Assign lowest feasible area where possible, but increase where needed for stress reduction, especially in primary loaded members. Place upper node_4 near midspan for optimal load transfer. Members connecting node_4 to nodes 1, 2, 3 distribute both vertical and horizontal forces.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss to a 4-node arrangement: nodes 1, 2, 3 (base), node 4 (apex, above node_3, slightly offset for triangulation). Connect: node_1–node_3, node_3–node_2, node_1–node_4, node_4–node_2, node_3–node_4. Optimize position of node_4 and assign smallest possible areas for adequate stress, ensuring closed, efficient structure with minimal mass. Members above and diagonals help share the applied load and evenly distribute stresses.",\n\n    "reasoning": "A single upper node enables triangulation and force distribution, minimizing unsupported spans. The triangle (nodes 1-3-4) resists the imposed load at node_3, while the diagonal (3-4) further splits the vertical force. Placing node_4 vertically above node_3 prioritizes direct force transfer. Limiting the truss to these critical members minimizes overall weight, while proper area assignment keeps stress-to-weight ratio and mass within constraint.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Steel density (not specified) is constant. Use minimum member areas where possible (\'1\': 0.195, \'2\': 0.782) and increase only where necessary based on member force calculations. Use force equilibrium—vertical and horizontal—at node_3 to solve for member forces. Approximate: distance node_1 to node_2 is 6.0 m, node_3 at (2,0). Place node_4 at (3.5, 2.8) above and slightly rightward of node_3 for improved distribution. Members: node_1-node_3 (\'2\'), node_3-node_2 (\'2\'), node_1-node_4 (\'2\'), node_4-node_2 (\'2\'), node_3-node_4 (\'1\'). Calculate mass: sum(length × area for all members). Estimate max stress in lower chord, increase area if needed until max(abs(stress))/mass < 0.5 and mass < 30. Check all members\' forces (simplified via geometry/truss method).",\n\n    "calculation": "Lower chord (node_1–node_3 and node_3–node_2): carries significant part of horizontal and vertical force from node_3.
