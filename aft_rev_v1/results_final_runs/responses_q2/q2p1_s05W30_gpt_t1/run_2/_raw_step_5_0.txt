The objective is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio (<=0.5) and total mass (<=30), ensuring all nodes are fully connected and constraints are satisfied.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Existing and historical designs have failed the strict stress-to-weight ratio constraint (<0.5), with the best prior structure achieving 0.4618 but at excessive mass (26.85). Most failures stem from overstressed or under-braced members and inefficient connection layouts. Structure must be closed, use minimal but sufficient triangulation, with all connections and areas optimized.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current design and most alternatives concentrate force transfer through relatively short, low-area members near node_3, creating high member stress (e.g., -49.4 for member_1). The best historical structure significantly lowers the stress-to-weight ratio but at the expense of high total mass (26.9). Overuse of low-area members leads to excessive stress, while excessive triangulation increases mass. The load path from node_3 (load applicator) must be spread efficiently to supports at node_1 and node_2, minimizing long, heavily loaded members, and triangulating to prevent high bending. The optimal rank_1 structure uses a near-minimum triangle but with large areas (areas \'2\', \'3\', \'4\'), achieving compliance but high mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Efficient truss design suggests using a near-pratt or warren configuration between supports, with a high, well-placed apex node to triangulate and distribute the loads. The apex node (above node_3) should be closer to the line joining supports to reduce member force magnitudes. Minimizing mass requires using the lowest area members that keep stress within limits. Direct strut connections from node_3 to both supports are necessary. The main triangle (supports + apex) should be as compact as possible to lower member forces.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the structure with a single high apex node (node_4) above node_3, creating an efficient two-triangle system (supports - node_3 - apex - supports). Use only the necessary five nodes: supports at (0,0), (6,0), loaded node_3 at (2.0,0), apex at (3.0,2.2), and a helper node at mid-span (4.0,0) to further reduce member lengths. Use minimally sufficient member areas (likely \'2\' and \'3\') based on past stress data. This balances stress, mass, and stability.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By forming two adjacent triangles sharing the apex node_4, we maximize structural stability and direct load paths. Members directly from node_3 to apex and to both supports create efficient load transfer. The helper node at midspan allows a subdivision reducing the length of the highest-stress bottom chord. Assign higher area to the most loaded (lower) members, using area \'3\' only if needed to bring stresses within limit. All nodes stay connected. Node_3 remains fixed for load and support as required.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Key assumptions: Allowable max(abs(stress)) per member is (0.5 × total mass) using provided criteria; node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed by constraints; apex (node_4) to be at (3.0,2.2) to reduce vertical force path and member length. Member connections: chords (node_1-node_3-node_2-node_5-node_4-node_1), diagonals (node_3-node_4, node_5-node_4). Assign area \'2\' to most members and area \'3\' only if required by stresses, based on similar geometry in history. Minimize use of high-area for weight savings.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Estimate member lengths: node_1-node_3 (2.0); node_3-node_2 (4.0); node_1-node_4 (~3.77); node_2-node_4 (~3.17); node_3-node_4 (~2.72); node_3-node_5 (2.0); node_5-node_2 (2.0); node_4-node_5 (~2.06). Choose area \'2\' (0.782/unit) for all except bottom chords and node_3-to-apex where past analysis shows high stresses, for which use area \'3\' (1.759/unit). Estimate mass ≈  (total_length of area \'2\')*0.782 + (total_length of area \'3\')*1.759. Members oriented to minimize stress. Using these, expect max member stress < 0.5×mass. Closed circuit with five nodes, maintaining all problem constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Double-check all members for full closure and connection.
