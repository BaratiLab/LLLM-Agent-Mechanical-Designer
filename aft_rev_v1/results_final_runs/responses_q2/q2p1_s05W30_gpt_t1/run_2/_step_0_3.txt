    "preamble": "This task is to design a minimum stress-to-weight ratio closed 2D truss using three given nodes, with specified loads and supports, under mass and stress/weight constraints. We may add nodes as needed and must select member areas from a specific set. All nodes must be joined in a single connected truss structure.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes are aligned horizontally. Node_1 (0,0) is pinned, Node_2 (6,0) is a roller, Node_3 (2,0) is a roller carrying (-15,-30) load. We need all nodes to be joined and possibly add members or 1 new node to improve force paths and triangulate.",
    
    "analysis": "The load on node_3 is downward and leftward. Triangulation is crucial for stiffness and minimal stress-to-weight. Connecting all three given nodes alone yields a single-triangle truss, which is optimal and minimal. However, this may lead to high axial forces due to short vertical separation. Placing an additional node above the loaded node_3 will create steeper force paths, improving geometry and load transfer. The load will be better split between two inclined members, reducing local peak stresses.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "The standard 'Warren' or 'Pratt' single-triangle configuration places an apex node above the loaded node, splitting the load more efficiently and lowering max stress per member. All members can be directly loaded in tension/compression, and supports provide clear reaction paths. This will minimize the stress-to-weight ratio for the given geometry and constraints.",
    
    "reasoning": "Add node_4 above node_3, say at (2,2.50), so that the triangle is tall enough to reduce member force magnitudes. Connect nodes as triangles: node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4. This structure triangulates, connects all nodes, provides two direct inclined paths for the applied load, and creates a single load-resisting triangle above the span.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: steel density omitted (will use area as pseudo-mass); all joints are pinned. Calculate member lengths from coordinates. Member force estimation by static equilibrium of node_3 and node_4. For minimal weight, keep all members at lowest possible area unless critical stress dictates otherwise. Next, select member areas: start with area_id '2' (A=0.782). Compute total mass and approximate axial force in worst member (likely node_3-node_4 or a base member). If stress-to-weight exceeds limit or mass >30, increase area_id where needed.",
    
    "calculation": "Lengths: node_3-node_4 = sqrt((2-2)^2 + (2.5-0)^2) = 2.50; node_1-node_3 = 2.00; node_2-node_3 = 4.00; node_1-node_4 = sqrt((2-0)^2 + (2.5-0)^2) = 3.20; node_2-node_4 = sqrt((6-2)^2 + (2.5-0)^2) = 4.72. Total length = 2.5+2.0+4.0+3.2+4.72=16.42. With area_id '2' (A=0.782): mass = 16.42*0.782=12.84 <30. Estimate force in node_3-node_4 from applied load: node_4 splits load at node_3, so max member force ≈ resultant/2/cosθ; θ=arctan(2.5/0)=90°, so likely tension. Estimate max member force = sqrt(15^2+30^2)/2=16.77. Stress = 16.77/0.782=21.46. Stress-to-weight ratio = 21.46/12.84=1.67>0.5. Repeat using area_id '4' (A=3.128). New mass = 16.42*3.128=51.34>30. Try mixed: heaviest demand (node_3-node_4, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4) at area_id '4', rest at '2'. mass = (2.5+3.2+4.72)*3.128 + (2.0+4.0)*0.782 = 10.42*3.128 + 6.0*0.782 = 32.59+4.69=37.28>30. Try area_id '3' (A=1.759) for above members: mass = 10.42*1.759 + 6.0*0.782 = 18.32+4.69=23.01. Max force/stress: 16.77/1.759=9.54. Stress-to-weight=9.54/23.01=0.41. Satisfies constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Design uses 4 nodes: original 3 plus one above node_3. Members: connect base (node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3), triangulate above (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4). Area_id '3' for top triangle and node_3 tie; area_id '2' for base. The resulting closed truss fulfills the closed, connected, minimal stress-to-weight ratio objective within the constraints. All calculations confirm feasibility.",
