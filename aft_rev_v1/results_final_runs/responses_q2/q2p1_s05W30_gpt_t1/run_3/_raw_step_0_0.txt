The structure must keep max(abs(stress))/total_weight below 0.5 and mass at most 30, using permitted member area IDs and possibly introducing new nodes for structural efficiency.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes provided: (0,0) pinned, (6,0) roller, (2,0) roller. Load applied at node_3 (2,0): F = (-15, -30) kN (i.e., left and down), requiring vertical/horizontal support reactions. The structure must be closed (single, connected). Optimal performance is required by distributing load paths and preventing single-member overloads.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Key load is downward/leftward at (2,0). Two supports at (0,0) and (6,0) provide vertical (and one horizontal) restraint. With only three horizontally arranged nodes, the basic closed polygon is a triangle. However, a flat triangle (all y=0) is mechanically unstable – so we should introduce an elevated node to form two triangles (i.e., a bridge truss) for triangulation and effective force distribution. Placing a new node above the base increases geometric stiffness, improves stress sharing, and is structurally typical. The load application at node_3 suggests that an overhead apex above node_3 will most efficiently transfer load to the supports.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Concerns: Flat geometry or direct connections won\'t carry vertical load efficiently. Direct top-chord bracing via a new node (node_4) above node_3 allows vertical and diagonal force sharing. Typical bridge geometry forms with apex node above loaded node (node_3), e.g., at (2, h). Best h sets angle close to 60°, which efficiently splits load paths and shortens diagonal members.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "I\'ll introduce node_4 at (2.0, 2.80), above node_3. This places node_4 roughly above node_3 but well within a practical span/depth ratio (over 1:2) to encourage triangularization. Members: node_1–node_3, node_3–node_2 (base), node_1–node_4, node_4–node_2 (top chords), node_3–node_4 (vertical tie). This configuration provides statically determinate, directly triangulated load paths from the loaded node to the supports, minimizing maximum member force for given member weights. Assign smallest allowable member areas unless force demands higher sections. Triangulation lessens demand on any single member; vertical and diagonal members receive the majority of load. Member areas assigned via conservative trial.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume unit density for mass calculation: mass = sum(length × area). Area IDs: \'0\':1, \'1\':0.195, \'2\':0.782, etc. Calculate member forces by resolving load and reactions (simple statics; use symmetry). For max force, vertical tie likely highest. Assign area \'4\' (3.128) to vertical tie, \'2\' (0.782) for diagonals/top chords, \'1\' (0.195) to base members if forces are low. Estimate member lengths using distance formula. Check mass and stress/weight ratio: max(|F|/A) / mass. Adjust area up if member overloaded. Confirm mass < 30. Sample lengths: node_1 to node_4: sqrt((2–0)^2 + (2.8–0)^2) = 3.41m. All calculations done to 2 decimal places.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Reactions: For vertical equilibrium, sum Fy=0: All downward force (-30kN) must be resisted by up-reactions at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller): assume node_1 takes majority. Horizontal force (-15kN) resisted at node_1 (pinned only). By geometry, node_4 above node_3 at y=2.8. Member lengths: node_1–node_3: 2.00m, node_3–node_2: 4.00m, node_1–node_4: 3.41m, node_4–node_2: 4.41m, node_3–node_4: 2.80m. Assign vertical member (node_3–node_4) area \'4\' (3.128): F_max ~30kN / 3.128 ≈ 9.59kN/unit area. Mass: (length × area) summed: (2×0.782)+(4×0.782)+(3.41×0.782)+(4.41×0.782)+(2.8×3.128) = 1.56+3.12+2.67+3.45+8.76=19.56 < 30.
