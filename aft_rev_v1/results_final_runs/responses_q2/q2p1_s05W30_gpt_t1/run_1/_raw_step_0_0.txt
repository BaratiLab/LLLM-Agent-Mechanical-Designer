The goal is to triangulate and dimension the structure so no member exceeds the permissible stress-to-weight ratio or mass.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "We have three collinear nodes: node_1 (0,0) pinned, node_2 (6,0) on a roller, node_3 (2,0) roller and loaded with (-15,-30). All must be connected and form a closed truss. Mass and stress-to-weight are capped. Triangulation/adding a fourth node may help. Consider symmetry and direct load path for node_3’s non-vertical force.",\n\n    "analysis": "All three nodes are collinear along the x-axis: this cannot sustain a vertical load at node_3 (the structure would be a straight line and is unstable under out-of-axis forcing). To form a stable, triangulated frame capable of handling vertical/horizontal forces, add a node_4 above the x-axis to create a triangle or ‘roof’ truss. This will distribute the load at node_3 into axial forces in the members and close the structure. Select member areas for lightness and acceptable stress.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Main insight: with three collinear nodes, any load not perfectly aligned to their axis leads to a mechanism (not a truss). Adding node_4 (at or near the vertical above node_3) is critical. Structure must be a triangle (or two if subdivided) for stability. Choosing node_4 at (2.0, 2.0) offers symmetry and short members. All three original nodes can link to node_4 and each other.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Adding node_4 at (2.0, 2.0) creates two triangles: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_2-node_3-node_4, ensuring stability and load path distribution. Connect original nodes to node_4, and also connect node_1-node_2 and node_2-node_3 to maintain closure. Low area members are favorable for weight, but members carrying large forces (possibly node_3-node_4 and node_1-node_4) may need slightly higher area.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Ignore self-weight for stress calculation; load applied statically; all joints are pinned. Use given areas as minimum as feasible. Assign member areas: thinest for horizontal base (node_1-node_2), slightly more for diagonals to handle vector from node_3. Calculate lengths (trig), estimate member forces from static equilibrium. Estimate stress = force / area, mass = Σ(length × area). Set up for each member, test against constraints (ratio ≤ 0.5, mass ≤ 30).",\n\n    "calculation": "1.

Static equilibrium (approx):\\n   - Load at node_3 is split between diagonals node_3-node_4 (vertical/horizontal) and the short links (node_3-node_1, node_3-node_2). Max stressed members expected to be the diagonals to node_4 (node_3-node_4). Assign thickest required area to node_3-node_4, use thinnest for non-critical members.\\n5. Area selection:\\n   - Assume max member force in node_3-node_4 ~ 33.5 units (magnitude of (-15,-30)), choose area just sufficient. Try area_id \'5\' (4.887) for node_3-node_4.
