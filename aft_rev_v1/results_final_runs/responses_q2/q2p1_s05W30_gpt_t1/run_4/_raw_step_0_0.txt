Loads are applied at node_3, with node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), and node_3 (roller) supports. Optimization objective: minimize max(abs(stress))/total_weight; key constraints: ensure the ratio <= 0.5 and mass <= 30. Triangulated connectivity and efficient load paths are required.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "With nodes nearly collinear along y=0, closing the truss and distributing the loads efficiently is challenging. The main load acts downward and to the left at node_3, requiring a braced/triangulated setup for stability. As given, adding an extra node above the base to form a stable triangle is optimal. Structural efficiency suggests an upper node to split/balance vertical and horizontal components, with all members connected to form a closed, triangulated truss.",\n\n    "analysis": "Supports: node_1 (pinned), node_2 and node_3 (roller) imply that node_1 anchors both axes while the others resist vertical displacement only. node_3 is loaded (-15, -30). The original nodes are collinear: a truss with these alone is unstable. Introducing a node (node_4) above the base (e.g., at (3, 2.5)) forms two efficient triangles, bracing the span and transferring loads efficiently. Members between every node ensure closure and redundancy. Likely high forces in the bottom members (especially node_3 to node_2/1), requiring careful member area selection within mass constraint.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "The optimal configuration forms two triangles anchored between node_1–node_2–node_4 and node_2–node_3–node_4. Placing node_4 at (3,2.5) is a symmetric choice, balancing vertical and horizontal spans and minimizing member lengths. Triangle formation reduces max member forces under applied loads at node_3 by distributing them through several short members. Shortest total length = lightest mass for a given area.",\n\n    "reasoning": "To maximize stiffness and keep stress low, the triangle through a top node (node_4) minimizes load path lengths and helps convert bending into axial force, which is most efficient. Full closure is achieved with edges: (node_1-node_2), (node_2-node_3), (node_3-node_1), (node_1-node_4), (node_2-node_4), (node_3-node_4). Choosing modest area_ids for lower members expected to see higher force (probably \'2\' or \'3\'), with minimum area \'1\' for diagonals, should minimize both stress and mass within limits.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All members have same Young\'s modulus; yield at max stress is not a concern, only stress-to-weight ratio. Area values from lookup; mass = sum(length_i × area_id_i); Using symmetry and statics: split load at node_3 between (node_2, node_4) and (node_4, node_1) members. Estimate member force in critical bar. For length: node_1-node_2 = 6, node_2-node_3 = 4, node_3-node_1 = 2, node_1-node_4 = sqrt( (3)^2 + (2.5)^2 ) ≈ 3.91, etc. Select area_ids: lower chord members (\'3\'=1.759), others \'1\'=0.195. Stress = force/area per bar, max stress via load decomposition. Limit ratio to <=0.5: Prefer heavier lower bars where main force spreads.",\n\n    "calculation": "Member lengths (m): n1-n2: 6.00, n2-n3: 4.00, n3-n1: 2.00, n1-n4: 3.91, n2-n4: 3.91, n3-n4: 3.20. Assign: Lower chord (n1-n2, n2-n3, n3-n1): area_id \'3\'=1.759; Diagonals/top (n1-n4, n2-n4, n3-n4): area_id \'1\'=0.195. Mass: (6+4+2)x1.759 = 21.108; (3.91x3)x0.195=2.29. Total mass ≈ 23.4 <30. Estimate max bar force (worst-case: node_3 vertical load, ~30kN, into n3–n4 diagonally of 3.20m with area=0.195): Stress = 30/0.195 ≈ 154 (kN/m²). Stress-to-weight ratio = 154/23.4 ≈ 0.24 <0.5.
