Previous structure iterations failed to satisfy the stress-to-weight constraint. Loads, supports, and fixed node positions at supports/loads are all provided.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives are clear: all nodes with loads/supports fixed; can add/tweak interior nodes; enforce strong triangulation and load path efficiency; strict stress-to-weight limit (≤0.5) and mass (≤30); avoid overstressed, underweight designs.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Examining current and historical designs shows: high local stress (esp. on left-side member under load at node_3) is pushing the stress-to-weight ratio to >5, breaching constraints. The current design integrates triangulation, yet uses \'1\' and \'2\' (small area) members, causing excessive stress, especially in direct load path bearings. The largest stress is -55.76 in member_1 (node_1–node_3), with mass 0.39—a very slender, overstressed member. Load is vertical-heavy (Fx=-15, Fy=-30) at node_3, transferred toward supports at node_1 (pinned, left), node_2 (roller, right), and node_3 (roller). Historic structure had even higher mass (~16) with less efficient load distribution and still missed constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Root issue is undersized critical members along direct load path, leading to massively overshot stress-to-weight ratio. The current structure\'s triangulation is reasonable, but weak members (\'1\', \'2\' area) cannot safely transmit the large load. Adding larger-area members in the critical direction, slightly realigning node_5 and possibly adding an upper chord node, could distribute loads more effectively. Full triangulation from left (node_1) to right (node_2) is key.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Propose: Keep nodes with supports/loads fixed as required. Add a top node (node_6) above node_3 to force direct load path triangulation, thus shortening unsupported spans and distributing load paths to both supports. Use large-area members (\'7\', \'8\', \'9\', \'10\') along the direct force paths (node_1–node_3, node_3–node_2, node_1–node_6, node_2–node_6, node_3–node_6), smaller (\'2\', \'3\') for interior triangulation. Remove node_4; reposition node_5 higher as a central strut. Ensure every node is interconnected—yielding a closed, redundant truss optimizing both force paths and redundancy.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "The addition of an upper node (node_6) above node_3 and mid-truss elevates will reduce span lengths and efficiently triangulate high vertical loads. Large-area members on main load paths greatly lower maximum stress, dramatically reducing stress-to-weight. Maintain minimal area on non-axial, lightly-loaded diagonals to save mass. This ensures not only constraint satisfaction but also robustness and practical buildability.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Key calculations: \\n- Areas: direct path = \'9\' (15.834), diagonals = \'2\' (0.782).\\n- All member lengths explicit (distance formula).\\n- Member stress = applied force / area; estimate dominant member force magnitude by resolving total applied load via statics and geometry.\\n- Mass = sum(length × area for all members).\\n- Stress-to-weight = max(abs(stress)) / total_mass.\\n- Adjust node_6 vertical location to balance vertical/horizontal force components and minimize principal stresses in key members.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Begin with following members: node_1–node_3 (\'9\'), node_3–node_2 (\'9\'), node_1–node_6 (\'8\'), node_2–node_6 (\'8\'), node_3–node_6 (\'8\'), all diagonals/interior with \'2\'.
