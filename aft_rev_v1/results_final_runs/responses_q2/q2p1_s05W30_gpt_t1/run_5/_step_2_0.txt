    "preamble": "The task is to design an optimal, fully connected (closed) 2D truss, minimizing the stress-to-weight ratio and total mass, while meeting strict constraints on stress-to-weight (≤ 0.5) and mass (≤ 30). Previous structure iterations failed to satisfy the stress-to-weight constraint. Loads, supports, and fixed node positions at supports/loads are all provided.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives are clear: all nodes with loads/supports fixed; can add/tweak interior nodes; enforce strong triangulation and load path efficiency; strict stress-to-weight limit (≤0.5) and mass (≤30); avoid overstressed, underweight designs.",
    
    "analysis": "Examining current and historical designs shows: high local stress (esp. on left-side member under load at node_3) is pushing the stress-to-weight ratio to >5, breaching constraints. The current design integrates triangulation, yet uses '1' and '2' (small area) members, causing excessive stress, especially in direct load path bearings. The largest stress is -55.76 in member_1 (node_1–node_3), with mass 0.39—a very slender, overstressed member. Load is vertical-heavy (Fx=-15, Fy=-30) at node_3, transferred toward supports at node_1 (pinned, left), node_2 (roller, right), and node_3 (roller). Historic structure had even higher mass (~16) with less efficient load distribution and still missed constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Root issue is undersized critical members along direct load path, leading to massively overshot stress-to-weight ratio. The current structure's triangulation is reasonable, but weak members ('1', '2' area) cannot safely transmit the large load. Adding larger-area members in the critical direction, slightly realigning node_5 and possibly adding an upper chord node, could distribute loads more effectively. Full triangulation from left (node_1) to right (node_2) is key.",
    
    "proposal": "Propose: Keep nodes with supports/loads fixed as required. Add a top node (node_6) above node_3 to force direct load path triangulation, thus shortening unsupported spans and distributing load paths to both supports. Use large-area members ('7', '8', '9', '10') along the direct force paths (node_1–node_3, node_3–node_2, node_1–node_6, node_2–node_6, node_3–node_6), smaller ('2', '3') for interior triangulation. Remove node_4; reposition node_5 higher as a central strut. Ensure every node is interconnected—yielding a closed, redundant truss optimizing both force paths and redundancy.",
    
    "reasoning": "The addition of an upper node (node_6) above node_3 and mid-truss elevates will reduce span lengths and efficiently triangulate high vertical loads. Large-area members on main load paths greatly lower maximum stress, dramatically reducing stress-to-weight. Maintain minimal area on non-axial, lightly-loaded diagonals to save mass. This ensures not only constraint satisfaction but also robustness and practical buildability.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Key calculations: \n- Areas: direct path = '9' (15.834), diagonals = '2' (0.782).\n- All member lengths explicit (distance formula).\n- Member stress = applied force / area; estimate dominant member force magnitude by resolving total applied load via statics and geometry.\n- Mass = sum(length × area for all members).\n- Stress-to-weight = max(abs(stress)) / total_mass.\n- Adjust node_6 vertical location to balance vertical/horizontal force components and minimize principal stresses in key members.",
    
    "calculation": "Begin with following members: node_1–node_3 ('9'), node_3–node_2 ('9'), node_1–node_6 ('8'), node_2–node_6 ('8'), node_3–node_6 ('8'), all diagonals/interior with '2'. Node_1 at (0.0,0.0), node_2 at (6.0,0.0), node_3 at (2.0,0.0), node_6 at (3.0,3.5), node_5 at (3.0,1.2) for interior bracing.

Not feasible—areas must be reduced further. Try principal load path as '4' (3.128), next as '3' (1.759).\n\nAdjusted: node_1–node_3, node_3–node_2 as '4'; node_1–node_6, node_2–node_6, node_3–node_6 as '3'; interior as '1'.\nRecalc: (2+4)*3.128=18.77, (5.10+5.10+3.62)*1.759=24.47, (1.67+2.30+3.23+3.23)*0.195=2.12; Total ≈ 45.35 (now feasible). Further downsize: direct path '3', others '1'.\n\nTotal mass ≈ (6)*1.759=10.55, (13.82)*0.195=2.70; sum ≈13.25. Now force: max node_1–node_3/area_3; F ≈ vertical component of applied (Fy=-30), member in compression; σ = F/A = 30/1.759≈17.06, stress-to-weight =17.06/13.3 ≈1.28.
