The main objective is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio while ensuring total mass and ratio constraints are not violated.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Three given nodes are colinear on the x-axis: node_1 (pinned) at (0,0), node_2 (roller) at (6,0), node_3 (roller) at (2,0). Load of (-15, -30) applied at node_3. Objectives: closed, all nodes connected, minimum stress-to-weight, total mass <= 30, ratio <= 0.5. The colinearity and supports suggest very high forces in any simple straight connection; triangulation or an auxiliary node is needed.",\n\n    "analysis": "Colinear base nodes limit basic triangulation: any member system without additional nodes will neither be statically stable nor optimal under vertical/lateral loading. Direct load at node_3 will induce large axial stresses if only horizontal connections are used. Adding an upper node (\'node_4\') to form two triangles will optimally anchor node_3\'s significant load. The optimal vertical position for node_4 will balance member lengths and angles, minimizing both mass and stress. Triangulating node_3 and pushing node_4 vertically above (between node_1 and node_2) will enhance load transfer and create efficient force paths.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key: Insert a single new node (\'node_4\') above the x-axis between node_1 and node_2 to create a classic truss triangle. Connect all four nodes so every base node is part of at least two triangles. Members: 1-4, 2-4, 3-4, plus 1-3, 3-2 to ensure full closure. Critical: node_4\'s y-value determines triangle efficiency and will be optimized based on minimizing member forces/mass trade-off.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Placing node_4 at (3.0, y), y>0, at the midpoint between node_1 and node_2 maximizes symmetry and load sharing. A reasonable y-coord is about 2.0-2.5, balancing member length and truss height. All truss members are then arranged to form two triangles with node_3 as a lower chord joint. Assign smaller area (area_id \'1\' or \'2\') to longer upper members, and the minimum required area (area_id \'2\') to base chord to keep weight low yet ensure strength in members that experience higher force. Vertical and diagonal members take most of the load from applied force; shortest members may have the smallest area to save weight.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Truss is statically determinate. Material is steel (ignored in ratio as areas are given). Mass = sum(length_ij × area for all members). Compute member lengths via distance formula. Force in each member estimated using method of joints, simplifying vertical/horizontal projections. Assign member areas per estimated force: area_id \'2\' (0.782) where force is moderate, area_id \'1\' (0.195) elsewhere. Check constraint: max(abs(stress))/(total_weight) ≤ 0.5, total mass ≤ 30. Use worst-case (largest) force for stress, total_weight from areas and lengths.",\n\n    "calculation": "Node positions: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (3,2.5). Member lengths: 1-4 = sqrt(9+6.25)=3.90, 2-4=sqrt(9+6.25)=3.90, 3-4=sqrt(1+6.25)=2.65, 1-3=2.00, 2-3=4.00. Approximate force in member 3-4 is largest due to downward load: F≈sqrt(15²+30²)=33.54, projected mostly onto 3-4 (as vertical reaction). Use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for 3-4. Other members carry less load: use area_id \'1\' (0.195). Mass = (3.90*0.195)+(3.90*0.195)+(2.65*0.782)+(2.00*0.195)+(4.00*0.195)=0.76+0.76+2.07+0.39+0.78=4.76<30. Max abs(stress)=F_max/area=33.54/0.782=42.91, ratio=42.91/4.76=9.03>0.5, so area_id for 3-4 must be increased. Try area_id \'4\' (3.128) for 3-4: mass= (3.90+3.90+2.65*3.128+2.00+4.00)*0.195=1.52+1.52+8.28+0.39+0.78=12.49, but 3-4\'s mass =2.65*3.128=8.28, so total mass=1.52+1.52+8.28+0.39+0.78=12.49, max stress=33.54/3.128=10.73, ratio=10.73/12.49=0.86>0.5. Try even higher area_id for 3-4: use area_id \'5\' (4.887): max stress=33.54/4.887=6.86, mass of 3-4=12.95, total mass=1.52+1.52+12.95+0.39+0.78=17.16, ratio=6.86/17.16=0.40≤0.5. Constraints satisfied. All other member areas can stay at \'1\'.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Final design uses new node_4 at (3.0,2.5). All members connect nodes for closure. Bottleneck force on 3-4 member dictates high area (area_id \'5\'), rest can be minimum (area_id \'1\'). All constraints — closure, stress-to-weight <=0.5, and total mass <=30 — are satisfied.
