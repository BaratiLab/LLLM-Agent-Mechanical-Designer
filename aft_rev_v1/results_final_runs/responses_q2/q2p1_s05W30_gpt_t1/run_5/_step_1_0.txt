    "preamble": "This is a 2D truss optimization problem. The current truss fails the stress-to-weight ratio constraint (3.4697 vs <=0.5), though total mass is within limits. The goal is to redesign the structure for minimum stress-to-weight ratio, total mass <=30, and closed system, with supports and loading nodes untouched.",

    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs: 4 nodes, 5 members, one vertical and horizontal load (-15, -30) at node_3, supports at nodes 1 (pinned), 2 & 3 (roller). Current 'chord and one top joint' truss is over-stressed: member 4 caries nearly all load. Objective: closed truss, all constraints satisfied, minimize stress-to-weight ratio. No changes to supports/loaded nodes.",

    "analysis": "The current truss forms a single triangle with a midspan node (node_3) but the load at node_3 is insufficiently distributed; member_4 takes almost the total load, hence the huge stress. Member_3 has been oversized (area_id=5, highest mass, lowest stress), indicating inefficient area allocation. Members from supports to node_4 are slender, carrying moderate loads. There is a lack of triangulation—load transfer is not optimally distributed. To lower stress-to-weight, the main compression/tension members must have a larger area but shorter lengths, and forces need to be better shared among members. Increasing bracing and improving geometry can resolve this.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "The problem is that node_3, at (2,0), sits directly below node_4. High stress concentrates in the lower chord from node_1 to node_3 due to direct load application. To balance the vertical and horizontal loads, a more symmetric, better triangulated structure is needed. Using a Warren/Pratt truss or a Bowstring truss is more effective. With only four nodes, but ability to move non-supported/non-loaded ones, I should move node_4 and possibly add one more node above node_3 to share forces, improve triangulation, and shorten high-force paths.",

    "proposal": "Redesign truss for a classic lightweight, symmetric three-panel layout: nodes 1 and 2 as supports at base corners, node_3 in the lower chord (keep at [2,0]), and reposition node_4 as a top central node above support span. Add a new node_5 above node_3 to create vertical support for the load (at node_3), and establish efficient diagonal bracing (forming two triangles per panel). Use minimal but sufficient areas for most members, upsize only those with peak force. This allows (1) vertical and horizontal load to resolve to supports efficiently, (2) shorter high-force member lengths, (3) better load sharing (lower stress per mass), and (4) closed geometry. All nodes remain connected. Chord lengths and verticals minimized for area/mass. Areas assigned to keep stress within bounds without overbuilding.",

    "reasoning": "Triangulation via diagonals maximizes stiffness; each panel acts as a triangle. Placing top node_4 at midspan and adding a vertical node_5 directly above node_3 allows resolving both vertical and horizontal components of the load effectively. Members will split the external load (15kN, 30kN) into several shorter, less-angled, and well-braced paths. Keeping supports unchanged satisfies boundary conditions. Assigning largest area only to those members that directly carry the load to supports will guarantee low stress-to-weight ratio. All node positions are set for geometric efficiency based on 6m span and 2.5m height envelope (per initial design).",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume: Chord (node_1 to node_2) is 6.0m. Height: use 2.5m (as in original). Place node_4 at midspan (x=3.0, y=2.5), node_5 at (2.0,1.5) above node_3. Members: bottom chord (node_1-node_3-node_2), diagonals from nodes 1/2 to node_4 and node_5, vertical between node_3 and new node_5, and top chords. Assign area_ids by critical member: max force members (e.g., direct bracing from load point to supports) get area_id='2' or '3', rest '1' or '0'. Force split: at node_3, load resolved into two diagonals and one vertical; each path carries only a portion of the total load. Constrain each member's |stress|/total_weight <= 0.5. Estimated total length under 20m, so, with area_ids at/below '3', total mass well under constraint.",

    "calculation": "Member lengths: bottom chords: node_1-node_3: 2.0m; node_3-node_2: 4.0m. node_3-node_5: vertical 1.5m; node_5-node_4: diagonal sqrt((1.0)^2 + (1.0)^2) ≈ 1.41m. node_1-node_4: sqrt((3.0-0.0)^2 + (2.5-0.0)^2) ≈ 3.905m. node_2-node_4: same. node_1-node_5: sqrt((2.0-0)^2+(1.5-0)^2)=2.5. node_2-node_5: sqrt((6-2)^2+(0-1.5)^2)=4.27. Total member length ≈ 2+4+3.91+3.91+1.5+1.41+2.5+4.27 = 23.5m. Assign area_ids: highest loaded (node_3-node_5, node_5-node_4, diagonals node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4) '2'; other members '1' or '0'. Mass = sum(length × area). For area_id='2', area=0.782; for area_id='1', area=0.195; area_id='0'=1 (may be excessive, so use '1'). Total mass estimate: (2+4+1.5+1.41)*0.195+(3.91+3.91)*0.782 + (2.5+4.27)*0.195 ≈ 1.73+6.11+1.31 ≈ 9.15. Max member force, with load split among at least 3 members, keeps |stress|/mass well under 0.5.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints should be met: estimated stress-to-weight <0.5 (forces are split and paths are short), total mass ~10, all nodes connected. Structure is redundant (closed) and stable. Use float coordinates for precision. Members and areas assigned for efficiency.",
