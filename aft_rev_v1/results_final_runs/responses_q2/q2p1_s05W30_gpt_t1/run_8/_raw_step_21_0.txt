Current and historical designs have not met the ratio constraint. The optimization goal is to find the lightest, most efficient, closed structure distributing stresses with proper triangulation while minimizing member areas and lengths.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given: Load at node_3 (-15, -30), supports at nodes 1 (pinned), 2 & 3 (roller). Key constraints: stress-to-weight ratio <= 0.5, total mass <= 30. History shows effective mass control but insufficient stress-to-weight margin (min ratio 0.5324). Previous trusses all exhibit stress concentrations or inefficient geometry.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Pinned (node_1) and roller (nodes_2,3) supports with a large downward and leftward force at node_3. Existing solutions cluster members around node_3, often leading to long lever-arms and excessive member forces, particularly for horizontal elements. Too much mass is concentrated in secondary members; often insufficient triangulation limits effective force transfer, causing stress concentrations. The minimal stress-to-weight ratio achieved previously (0.5324) suggests further gains are possible by 1) increasing height/span ratio for triangulation, 2) moving top chord nodes up to create deeper triangles, and 3) possibly reducing some member areas where force flow is modest.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Observation: Designs with higher top chords or more pronounced truss depth yield better stress distribution. Nodes clustered near the lower chord (y=0) overweight diagonal bottom members and underutilize top members. To improve, we must deepen the truss vertically and balance node spacings horizontally to optimize angles and leverage.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign: Move midspan nodes higher and further apart for optimal truss triangulation (Warren truss pattern). Use a symmetric, fully triangulated truss, placing a \'top chord\' at substantial y-height above node_3, enabling efficient path for vertical and horizontal force dissipation. Use minimum necessary member areas, except for members directly loaded (larger area). Drop redundant or overlong secondary members.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A Warren/Pratt truss with deep triangulation and a raised top chord distributes both vertical and horizontal forces efficiently. Elevating nodes above node_3 maximizes lever-arm for resisting moments induced by eccentric loading, which directly reduces stresses in bottom chord and diagonals. Concentrate larger sections near high-force areas (bottom chords at node_3); assign minimal sections elsewhere. Full triangulation also ensures all nodes are connected.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume total span ~6.0 (between node_1 and node_2), with loaded node_3 at x=2.0. Place a main top node near midspan (e.g., node_4 at (3.0, 2.2)), a secondary elevated node above node_5 (~x=4.5, y=1.6), supporting symmetric triangulation. Use min area (area_id \'1\') except for directly loaded members and bottom chord (\'2\'). Estimate stress using load-path logic: vertical load splits into left and right support reactions; diagonal compression/tension through triangles; top chord compression mostly; bottom chord mixed.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Compute truss depth: for vertical equilibrium, horizontal reactions at supports, and vertical reactions: establish force equilibrium, e.g., \\u2211Fy=0, \\u2211Fx=0, and moment about node_1 = 0. Given geometry, estimate main diagonal forces from joint resolution for loaded node (node_3), triangulate top chord to handle majority of compressive force, and assign minimal areas elsewhere. For target stress-to-weight ratio, set all high-force members to area_id \'2\'; assign area_id \'1\' to top-chord and diagonals away from high-stress region. Total member length \\u00d7 area yields mass ~13.5-14; ratio of max member force (approx 7) / 14 ~0.5, under constraint.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "All nodes connected, no isolated nodes, all supports and load nodes unchanged.
