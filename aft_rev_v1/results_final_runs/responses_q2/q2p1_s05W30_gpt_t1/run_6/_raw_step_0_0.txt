The main goal is to design a closed (all nodes connected) truss minimizing the stress-to-weight ratio, subject to the specified area IDs and a strict mass and stress/weight constraint.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "The given nodes are collinear, making direct triangulation impossible with just these locations. All are supported, but node_3 receives a significant (mainly downward-right) force. The structure must be closed and all nodes connected. We are allowed to add nodes to achieve triangulation and improved force distribution. Need to select members and area_ids to minimize max|stress|/weight <= 0.5 and mass <= 30.0.",\n\n    "analysis": "With all nodes on the x-axis, a simple line connection forms a mechanism unless additional nodes are introduced off-axis to achieve rigidity by triangulation. The primary challenge is resolving the (-15,-30) N load on node_3. Ideally, we add a single node above/below the x-axis to create two triangles, distributing load paths and keeping the truss statically determinate. The supports\' arrangement (pinned and rollers all on collinear nodes) means uplifting forces are resisted, and sliding prevented at node_1; redundant support at node_3 is mostly for vertical reaction. Members parallel to large force components will be critical. Avoiding long, heavy members will help reduce mass. Choosing moderate area_ids reduces both max stress and mass.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "By adding a node above node_3, we can create a triangle connecting node_1, node_2, and the new node (node_4), then connect node_3 to node_4. This makes two triangles: (node_1, node_2, node_4), and (node_2, node_3, node_4), thus closing the structure. This spreads the load from node_3 between two members and helps keep member lengths manageable. Selecting area_ids: using a larger area for the most loaded member out of node_3 and moderate/small for others, so as not to overburden mass constraint nor allow stress ratio to creep over limit.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Adding a single node above node_3, say node_4 at (2.0, 2.5), provides effective triangulation and ensures all nodes are structurally connected and closed. Makes the truss statically determinate and allows efficient load path distribution. Connect: node_1-node_2, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_1 (to close base), and each to node_4 (which triangulates cell). Members from node_3 to node_4, node_2 to node_4, and node_1 to node_4. For area_ids, assign a larger area (id \'4\', area=3.128) to the most stressed top chord (likely node_3 to node_4) and smaller areas (id \'2\', area=0.782 or \'1\', area=0.195) to diagonals and sides. All member forces assumed to be < 40kN and effective area-age ratio tuned for 0.5 stress-to-weight at maximum.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume all members made of same material (unit density for simplicity). Area_ids: using \'4\' (3.128) for node_3-node_4, \'2\' (0.782) for diagonals, \'1\' (0.195) for base. Compute member lengths using coordinates. Total mass = sum(length × area).
