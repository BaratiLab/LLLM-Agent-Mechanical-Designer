The existing design is overbuilt and violates the stress-to-weight constraint: its stress-to-weight ratio of 0.7311 > 0.5. The objective is to minimize stress-to-weight ratio and mass while satisfying all constraints, with a closed, efficient load path.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The existing structure uses triangles, has an elevated node (4), and over-sizes some members while others are under-stressed. There is a significant imbalance: member_2 is heavily loaded (-14.53), while others are barely working. Mass (19.87) is within the limit but the stress distribution is poor, causing constraint failure.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current design routes the load primarily into member_2, creating a critical path that\'s both inefficient and risky. Most other members are lightly stressed, indicating poor load sharing. The high negative stress on member_2 means it\'s the weak link, and most truss area isn\'t contributing to capacity. Constraint violation is due to overloading this member relative to total mass. In addition, upper node (4) generates a long, vertical member (member_6) that is very heavy (7.82), bloating the structure mass with little gain in performance.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Load at node_3 is both horizontal and vertical; need to distribute it more efficiently between nodes 1 and 2. Adding a node directly above/below node_3 (close to load) will triangulate the force flow and relieve critical members. Reducing vertical height of node_4 (or shifting node_4 up and right) can shorten member_6. Eliminating underworked members (or combining and reconfiguring them) can further trim mass, while increasing the cross-section only where required.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign: Drop the current node_4 and reposition it as node_4\': directly above node_3 at (2.0, 1.8), making a compact triangle to efficiently transfer the applied load to supports. Remove unnecessary members, use the smallest possible area_id consistent with stress, and keep all supports and load locations fixed as required.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation from node_3 to node_1 and node_2 with an additional node right above the load will divide the applied forces and generate a smaller, more evenly stressed truss. By keeping the truss as compact as possible, member lengths (and thus mass) are minimized. Members carrying the largest forces will use slightly larger area_id, while lightly stressed members use minimal area. The result is a closed truss that is light and efficient, with an improved, constrained stress-to-weight ratio.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Steel (area_id -> area mapping as given), member mass = length × area, stress = force / area. Force flows: Node_3 pushes upward on node_4, distributing vertical and horizontal load to nodes 1 and 2. Two bottom members triangulate node_4 to nodes 1 and 2. Short diagonals carry more force due to geometry. Place node_4 at (2.0, 1.8) to keep members short (vertical = less than previous height). Member layout: 1-2 (bottom), 1-3, 2-3, 3-4, 1-4, 2-4. The force in diagonals estimated as ~1/2 resultant of applied force (Pythagoras). Checking area sizes: for expected maximum force ~18 (from load vector 15,30) over area 0.782 (id=\'2\') yields max stress ~23, so safe with lower area in lightly loaded members.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Geometry: node_4 at (2,1.8) puts diagonals at ~2.18 units long, vertical at 1.8, bottom chord at 6.0. Plan member cross-sections: bottom chord (1-2): minimal (id=\'1\'), short diagonals (1-4, 2-4): next up (id=\'2\'). Diagonals (1-3, 2-3): minimal (id=\'1\'), vertical (3-4): minimal (id=\'1\') since load is split. Forces: diagonals carry bulk of force but still << capacity at these areas. Estimated structure mass: bottom (6×0.195=1.17), diagonals (2×2.18×0.782=3.41), 1-3/2-3 (2×2.0×0.195=0.78), vertical (1.8×0.195=0.35); sum ≈ 5.71 << 30. Max stress: ~11.5 in a ~0.782 area, so ratio ≈ 11.5/5.7=0.20, which is within 0.5.
