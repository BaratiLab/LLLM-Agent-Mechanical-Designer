Current and historic designs do not meet stress-to-weight criterion (<0.75). New solution must resolve this and keep mass under 30.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Stress-to-weight violation is the recurring fault in earlier designs (all >1.95, best mass 11.1). All provided trusses centralize the load on one lower node (\'node_3\'), suppressing redistribution. Supports persistently at nodes 1, 2, 3 (with node_3 being loaded and on-rolling support; node_1 pinned; node_2 roller). Closed triangulated layouts performed better structurally. All trusses connect all nodes—fully connected, mostly planar. Areas mostly \'1\' or \'2\', possibly too small for the load. Solution: Reduce peak member force, short and direct load paths, increase key member area judiciously.",\n\n    "analysis": "Repetitive over-stress always occurs in member_1, stretching from support (node_1) to loaded node (node_3) or from load node (node_3) to node_2. The dominant load is at node_3, (-15,-30): a nearly vertical downward force. No structure so far sufficiently diverts this force from member_1 (area_id \'1\'). Existing top-chord designs put too much force in a single bottom horizontal strut. Past triangles extended weakly upward (1.45-3.7), but vertical load stays low. Several alternative trusses perform even worse with smaller top region and heavier verticals. Stress reductions require: (a) direct, nearly vertical members under the load or raising top-chord nodes vastly higher, (b) increasing key member areas while keeping most others slim. Closed connection achieved but not strength distribution. Principle stresses localize due to short moment arm—force needs triangulated dispersal and vertical support. Increasing top height and forming two nearly equal, vertical load-transferring triangles is classic practice.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Strong patterns: almost all failures hyperload member_1 or horizontal members near node_3. Bodily, a Warren type girder produces high stresses with short depth; a Pratt-like triangulation significantly reduces peak internal force. The allowed area set is discretized; choosing \'4\' (~3.13 area) or \'5\' (~4.88 area) where needed for highly loaded vertical/horizontal members is essential. A symmetrical, closed truss with a very deep section (raise new node_4 high over node_3) will split the work among more members, much lowering stress via geometry. Keeping nodes at x=2 helps transfer the load directly to supports but we need a top node higher than before. Place area_id \'4\' or higher in load-critical chords, use \'1\' or \'2\' elsewhere. Triangulate fully but avoid excess member doubling/mass uptick.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss to (a) deepen it significantly by raising the top chord, (b) use at least one vertical from loaded node_3 to the new, much higher top node_4, and (c) triangulate side bays robustly to hand-off forces to both end supports. Connections: node_1--node_2 (base), node_1-& node_4-& node_2, vertical from node_3 upto node_4; diagonals from node_1/node_2 to node_3 and node_4; close base. Use a larger area_id (\'4\') for the vertical from node_3 to new node_4, moderate area_id for chords (\'2\' or \'3\'), smallest possible for diagonals. Optimize top node_4 y-position to minimize peak member force, likely shifting node_4 straight vertically above node_3. Calculate base lengths and total mass to meet the constraints.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Triangulation increases redundancy and diminishes maximum force per member. The greatest load case—drop at node_3—will be shared by (i) the vertical (node_3 to node_4); (ii) diagonal members slanting down/right and down/left linking to node_2 and node_1; and (iii) the top horizontal member forming the upper chord. Support constraints dictate that vertical reaction only develops at node_1; node_2/3 roll horizontally. Deepening the truss, as in classic bridge layouts, divides the vertical downward force, while side diagonals pick up additional horizontal force. Assign largest area_id to the member expected to carry the peak vertical (the vertical member from loaded node_3 up to new top node_4); assign mid-level or minimum areas elsewhere for weight tradeoff. Bay height at top node_4 set large enough (y=5.4) to reduce member force via geometric lever arm. This approach balances mass (~8-12) while radically dropping max stress to well below constraint, avoiding earlier flaw of assigning slim direct areas to highly-stressed members.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Nodes to be used: node_1 (0.0, 0.0), node_2 (6.0, 0.0), node_3 (2.0, 0.0) as fixed by supports/load. Add one top node above node_3: node_4 (2.0, y_4). Set y_4 high; estimate y_4=5.4 for deep truss. Members: base: node_1-node_2 (\'1\'), node_1-node_3 (\'2\'), node_2-node_3 (\'2\'); vertical: node_3-node_4 (‘4’); upper chord: node_1-node_4 (\'2\'), node_2-node_4 (\'2\'); diagonals: node_1-node_4 (\'2\'), node_2-node_4 (\'2\'), closing node_1--node_4 and node_2--node_4. No isolated nodes; all enable force transfer paths (fully triangulated). Area assignments: Key (node_3-node_4): \'4\', others: \'2\' and \'1\'. Perform static calculations: major vertical reaction at node_1; minor at supports; vertical member carries ~full load, but moment balance reduces member stress with deep truss. Summing up, expected peak internal member force on vertical: ≈ sqrt(15^2+30^2) ≈ 33.54 kN. Assign area 3.13. Estimate stress ~10.7 (=33.54/3.13) << max allowable with mass constraint.",\n\n    "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_4 at (2.0,5.4) chosen for deepening effect.

Largest member stress now max(33.54/1.759)=19.07, stress-to-weight =19.07/25.14=0.76, just above (try area_id \'4\' for safety if needed).
