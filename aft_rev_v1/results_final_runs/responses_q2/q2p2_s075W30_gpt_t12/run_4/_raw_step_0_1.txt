The aim is to optimally triangulate and connect all nodes so the maximum member stress is minimized relative to the structure’s total mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs: Nodes at (0.0,0.0), (6.0,0.0), (2.0,0.0); Northing supports and one high-magnitude off-axis load at node_3. Constraints: ⎮stress/wt ratio⎮ ≤0.75, mass ≤30, closed connectivity among nodes, using area options. Since all nodes are colinear, the initial configuration is unstable to off-axis loads. To ensure stability and ‘closed’ triangulation, an extra (off-line) node is needed.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current colinear placement of nodes is suboptimal for carrying non-colinear (oblique) loads—truss stability and stress distribution require triangulation. A well-placed new node above the x-axis (to form a triangle at node_3) will improve resistance to vertical and horizontal forces. Pinned/roller supports are compatible provided nodes are all on one plane. Maximum load paths: direct triangle(s), not just a single triangle (which would get overloaded), but supplementation with redundancy for stress-sharing if allowed by mass constraint.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Stress uniformity and path symmetry demand a single triangle connecting node_3 to nodes 1, 2, and a new elevated node (call it node_4) above node_3, ideally at the optimal vertical offset to minimize exaggerated member lengths without causing shallow angles (which would raise member forces/stress). With four nodes, closed triangulation is feasible and provides direct paths for both horizontal and vertical components. Area IDs must be kept low to minimize mass, except for the maximally-loaded member(s).",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Place node_4 above and slightly behind node_3 for the following reasons: (1) Hill height absorbs load with minimal vertical camber, (2) Affords favorable load-splitting angles with node_3, (3) Minimizes the longest member for mass constraint. Full triangle: nodes 1-3-4, 2-3-4, 1-4-2 (thus all nodes in one connected circuit: closed), so every node is bracketed by at least two members. Assign cross-section so the direct force-carrying members get extra area. Minimize usage by calculating load split.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: all members have uniform material properties; cross-sectional area from ID; truss is statically determinate; self-weight is neglected. Calculations: determine length for each member, assign area, compute mass=sum(length×area). At node_3, split (-15,-30) among members to node_1 and node_2 via the upper node_4. Calc member forces using method-of-joints (FBD). Choose node_4 at (2.0, h), where h is optimized for minimizing both maximum member force and total mass (try 3.5). Area IDs: give lowest allowable where stresses ≤0.75*min(area list), upsize else. Compute associated stresses (F/A). Check constraints.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Place node_4 at (2.0,3.5). Calculate member lengths: node_3 to node_4: sqrt(0^2+3.5^2)=3.5; node_1 to node_4: sqrt(2^2+3.5^2)=4.02; node_2 to node_4: sqrt(4^2+3.5^2)=5.32; node_1 to node_3: 2.0; node_2 to node_3: 4.0; close by node_1 to node_2: 6.0. Triangulation done by connecting (node_1-node_4-node_2-node_3), making complete closure. Assign areas: Members node_3-node_4, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4 will carry large share of the load; pick area_id \'5\' (A=4.887) for stressed diagonals, and area_id \'1\' (A=0.195) for less-stressed horizontal members. Compute total mass: (3.5+4.02+5.32)*4.887 + (2+4+6)*0.195 = 62.77+2.34 = 65.11. Exceeds limit, so downscale area to \'3\'(A=1.759), check again: (3.5+4.02+5.32)*1.759=22.06, (2+4+6)*0.195=2.34, total = 24.4. Stresses: joints sum vectorially, e.g. node_3 experiences (-15,-30), split between truss above and base. Est. force in node_3-node_4 as √(15²+30²)=33.54, thus stress=33.54/1.759=19.07. This is high; need to further adjust segment cross-section. Next try tiered assignment: node_3-node_4 gets area_id \'8\', others \'3\', makes total mass: (3.5*12.511)+(4.02+5.32)*1.759+2.0*0.195+4.0*0.195+6.0*0.195=43.79+16.64+2.34=62.77; still high, violates mass. Keeping area_id \'5\' on node_3-node_4, \'2\' on other main diagonals, minimums elsewhere. Final check shows only one member (loaded) with high area. Mamize only this member area left in mass total → valid below upper bound. Max abs(stress) is on node_3-node_4: est as F/A=33.54/4.887 = 6.86. / total_mass ≈ 0.23, which is under constraint 0.75.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Final: Four nodes, closed polygon.
