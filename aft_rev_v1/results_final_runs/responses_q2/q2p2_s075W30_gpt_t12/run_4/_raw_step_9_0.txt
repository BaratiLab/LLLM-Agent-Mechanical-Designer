The current design and historical structures all violate the stress-to-weight ratio constraint. The goal is to design an optimal, feasible, closed truss with all nodes participating, given the support and load placement requirements.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: Redesign to lower the max(abs(stress))/mass to <=0.75 without exceeding 30 mass. Loads are strong and off-center, concentrating forces in a key middle node (node_3). Most previous structures are light but have poor stress performance and limited triangulation. None satisfy the targeted utilization constraint.",\n\n    "analysis": "The main load (-15, -30) at node_3 is significant, distributed diagonally downward and to the left. node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), and node_3 (roller) are all at y=0, forming a straight support line. Past solutions do not adequately channel nor distribute loads; most \'light\' designs unduly concentrate force into a few slender members that fail stress-based utilization. Previous higher-mass triangulated shapes greatly overshot mass yet lower stress levels, but limited resolution in member area and top chord geometry consistently creates an overstressed lower horizontal member (\'member_1\': -55.86 in current) or sparse linking to top nodes. Key inefficiency is lack of robust triangulation at node_3 and insufficient top/bottom tie-in increasing local force per unit mass and poor dynamic redundancy. Historic attempted Vierendeel-type trusses overload bottom member; single triangle attempts diminish mass but spike stress. To meet utilization, load must be delivered to the supports more directly by triangulating above and tying with adequate-area members.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Close members suggest excessive load path length and force in 1-2 critical members aggravated by geometry. Solution: Abandon sparse high-crown designs; adopt deeper, direct triangle routing load from node_3. Members near node_3 must collectively resolve both force components quickly, requiring more than two bars at node_3. Lower, wider, and more symmetric arrangements (with verticals and diagonals from node_3 directly to the top chords, and from the top back down to the supports) favor both load route efficiency and minimize global member stress-to-mass ratio.",\n\n    "proposal": "Full redesign favored. Use nodes at bottom span (node_1 [0,0], node_2 [6,0], node_3 [2,0]), and add only one carefully placed upper node DISTINCT from historical options: center it above node_3 to optimize triangulation and symmetry. Construct two triangles under the load with close, short members, and define two triangles on either flanking support for overall closure. Connect upper node, node_4, to all three bottom nodes; this avoids long underslung bottom chord overload and sharpens load paths, yielding best ratio for a moderate-area selection. Calculate ideal elevation and lateral offsets for node_4 to maximize distributive benefit under constraints.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Best-practices for minimal stress-to-mass trusses under a concentrated vertex load favor triangulated arrangements with low aspect ratio meshes and shortest possible force transmit paths. By vertically aligning node_4 above node_3 (scaled for moment arm), force is channeled into short compression diagonals toward the supports, splitting both x and y components symmetrically. Proper connection of node_4 to both supports and the load node—plus closure along the bottom—ensures constraint adherence: two bottom chords spread between three points, three deep diagonals intercepting both supports quickly, as well as closure member directly linking node_1-node_2, ensures geometry is braced and all nodes are involved.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume area_id = \'10\' (19.548) for loaded central members and \'6\' (7.037) for less stressed external links to bring both member stress and weight within bounds. Set node_4 above node_3 at (2.00, h), find height by force balance to assure all triangle angles (>40deg) to avoid high forces. Using statics, larger elevation minimizes force splittings, but increases mass. Try h ~4.25 (creating two near-45deg diagonals, side lengths sqrt((2-0)^2 + 4.25^2)=4.72, sqrt((6-2)^2 + 4.25^2)=5.19). Use minimal geometry for direct triangulation.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node distances: node_1–node_3=2.00, node_3–node_2=4.00, node_4–node_3=4.25, node_4–node_1= sqrt(2^2 + 4.25^2)=4.72, node_4–node_2=sqrt(4^2+4.25^2)=5.85. Use area id \'10\' for diagonal members (large compression/tension). Member 1 (node_1 to node_3, bottom chord) bears nearly half the vertical from node_3 load; split left/right accordingly. Estimate force in each: Diagonal members hold ~sqrt(Fx^2+Fy^2)/2 ~16-17 units, each bottom ~15 unit axial max. Stress in individuals: 15/19.548 ~ 0.77 < 0.75, so raise to next higher member area permissible and check ratio (using area id \'9\', 15.834, for diagonals: 15/15.83=0.95 >0.75; area id \'10\' needed for at least two). Diagonals will dominate stress ratio, with mass budget ok (each: area × length sum, top 3–4 members dominate out of 6). Totals: 2×4.72×19.548 + 2×5.85×19.548 + short links total well under 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Choice: Four nodes (minimum for 2 Δ triangles), six members = two triangles. Assign diagonals connecting (node_3, node_1) to node_4, close triangle top with link (node_4–node_2). Use heaviest member area (10) for main triangles, lighter area (6) for closure (node_1, node_2) and less‐stressed links, all nodes included, full closure, all load paths robust.
