Objective: produce an optimized, constraint-satisfying, closed truss, minimizing stress-to-weight and mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Review shows support at nodes 1 (pinned), 2 & 3 (roller); node_3 has major load (-15, -30). Previous structures failed—either vastly overweight or with members overstressed. Must construct a robust, lightweight design, avoid oversized vertical elements, minimize high-force short members, ensure closure, and finely select areas.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The present and historic designs both set node_3 as a force node between two base supports. Existing approaches create short, highly loaded base links (high/max compression/tension forces), additionally members linking node_4 and _5 above with non-optimal triangulation. Structure \'constraint_not_met_2\' is lighter but can\'t satisfy the stress-to-weight constraint (ratio 3.7382 >> 0.75). The stress is highly concentrated in member_1 (from node_3 to node_1), suggesting poor load diffusion and inadequate vertical triangulation, particularly above the base. The unchallenged use of large-area and heavy vertical members in \'constraint_not_met_1\' likewise fails pruning mass efficiently.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: (1) Node_3 is the load epicenter—requires proper triangulated vertical rise above with minimal horizontal span, (2) Dense base linkage creates short, heavily loaded members (bad for ratio), (3) Too small vertical or too large horizontal extents add overstress/or dead weight. Optimal rectangular layout with bracing balances. Proposal must shift emphasis upward-triangulation; spread between base and higher nodes; emphasize equal path lengths so multiple members share forces.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss to include two elevated nodes forming a symmetrical triangle with the base (nodes 1, 2, and 3 fixed by supports), keeping node positions fixed where supports/loads applied. Add two higher nodes—one above node 1 and node 2 (as node_4 and node_5), to create a Warren-type or Pratt-type truss. Connect these to form triangles for proper vertical and lateral load distribution from node_3 along both upward (bracing members) and across the top back to nodes_1 and _2. Minimize member lengths and number, optimizing for load path and cholse lowest possible areas narrowly satisfying strength.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Use Warren/Pratt triangulation: triangle-upwards across the loaded node, optimizing symmetric load-sharing, avoiding isolated high-force member—thus reducing max stress in any member. Raise additional nodes vertically rather than farther horizontally (to reduce member length/mass). Place top chord (nodes_4,5) such that vertical component equals approx half of load at node_3, resulting in roughly balanced forces in all compression/tension members. Use minimum necessary member areas to just meet anticipated compliance, favoring 0.195/0.782 areas in diagonal and only raising as needed for higher loads.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Node selection: keep node_1=(0, 0), node_2=(6,0), node_3=(2,0). Place node_4 over node_1 (at x=0, y=2.8), node_5 over node_2 (x=6, y=2.8) making a flat top with a height allowing enough triangulation (~one half base span). Diagonal nodes ensure optimal force paths: create triangles from supports to the elevated top, pass loads cleanly via trusses. Members: Connect node_1-node_2, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_1 (base), node_4-node_5 (top), and triangulate node_3 to node_4 and node_5; also, cross members node_1-node_4, node_2-node_5 to anchor spans. Use minimum feasible member areas and estimate each member\'s stress via static analysis. If geometry permits, diagonals can have the smallest viable sections as tension/compression allow. Run required mass calculation for target areas.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Geometry: node_3 carries (-15,-30)—resolved between diagonals (node_3–node_4, node_3–node_5). Height=2.80, horizontal runs: 0-6m bottom, 0-6m top. All members: base (1-2, 1-3, 2-3)—tension/compression ~load/2 ≈ 15–30kN, estimate diagonal forces by \\u221a(x^2+y^2) system and enforce smallest area whose stress \\u2264 allowable (max_stress/area no higher than approx 0.7*global_mass). Total mass: Sum(member_length × area) with selected cross-sections. This geometry and force division brings expected max stress below hard threshold; mass with most members at area 0.195 and a few at 0.782 or 1.759 easily keeps under 30 units. Test, then fine-tune members and record precisely.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Confirm the complete closure (all nodes interconnected by multiple triangles), minimal member count, small but sufficient member area selection for dominating stressors—use primarily area \'1\', only apply \'2\' or higher if stress would exceed 0.75 × mass. Validate: symmetry of triangle, height suitable for large downward force sharing, and minimized member length for low self-weight. Confirm truss closure with shortest and fewest members, all nodes part of triangle systems, no high local stresses, and total mass ≪ 30.
