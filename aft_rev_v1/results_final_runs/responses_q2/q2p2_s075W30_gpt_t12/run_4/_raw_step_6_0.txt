Objective: design the most efficient, fully connected, constraint-satisfying 2D truss connected per instructions.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Problem: Most recent design exceeds allowed mass and under-utilizes structural capacity. Load is applied at node_3; nodes 1, 2, 3 are supports; node_4 provides height. Previous attempts indicate either mass deficit or surpassing stress constraints. Better geometry or utilization of member areas is critical for constraint satisfaction.",\n\n    "analysis": "Examining previous structures, the (1) overused thick diagonal (member_6, area_id=4, massive, under-stressed), (2) poor triangulation (members not arranged to maximize efficient load paths), and (3) inefficient overall geometry. Past efforts to reduce member size violated max-stress. Minimized mass trades yielded excessive internal forces, collectively missing the goal. Furthermore, vertical load at node_3 requires effective vertical support; loads must pass through multiple triangulated, short, and otherwise highly efficient path(s). The support configuration restricts manipulation of base nodes, height, and load node, but node_4 (apex) and connectivity can be rebalanced. Stress routes in the former setup left some major members oversize but underused. Most prior attempts failed from giving weight saving preference rather than structural adequacy or connectivity.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Pattern: All high performing designs are direct load-to-support types (i.e., minimized MLM: Member Length Management). Strong, high apex (node_4) allows for better vertical force resolution. Nontriangulation and long members concentrate stress, causing failure at lower mass. All well-performing structures use efficient triangle pathing and minimal member redundancy, emphasizing vertical projection for the load at node_3. So, the solution should emphasize vertically stacking above node_3 while maintaining full apsidal connectivity (nodes 1,2 ↔ node_4). Lower member sizes, maintain reasonable lengths, optimize vertical transfer at node_3.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign with a slightly lower but \'broader\' triangle: node_4 shifted closer above node_3 for better vertical action transfer, minimize heavy diagonals. Ensuring closed truss with efficient geometric triangulation. Use only smaller and intermediate area_ids with focused sizing on high-stress routes. Keep all nodes referenced by existing loads unchanged.",\n\n    "reasoning": "To satisfy the constraints while ensuring adequate load transmission, I\'ll use a shallow but centered \'Warren\' truss shape. Node_4 will be centered near/above node_3, forming a tall triangle but with a measured apex (lowered from the previous 5.4, e.g. to ~3.6). To boost stiffness and reduce overuse of one heavy diagonal, introduce an additional midspan node (node_5) slightly right of node_3 to allow better triangulation and mass savings. The connections will maintain closure. The area_ids are chosen strategically: diagonals/intermediate (area_id \'2\'), verticals (area_id \'1\'), shorter chords (area_id \'1\'), designed according to mandatory values. Each member and node is positioned with geometry minimizing their individual lengths (and, consequently, mass) and distributing load effectively for all supports.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Key: Maintain support and load node position. Add centroid apex—node_4 at (2.0, 3.6)—directly above node_3 to minimize distance/load share across horizontal span. Introduce node_5 at (4.0, 1.8) to triangulate the right-hand bay. All new/additional nodes are placed using basic geometry, avoiding symmetry breaking. Assign area_ids for main vertical/diagonals as \'2\'. Compute anticipated maximum force in vertical members using classical truss geometry (estimate force at node_3 distributed among vertical and diagonal members, limiting stress exposure).
