All nodes must be connected and areas chosen to satisfy design stress and mass limits.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes form a horizontal base (node_1, node_2), with node_3 offset left of center on the same base. The force acts on node_3 obliquely (-15,-30). To form a closed, fully triangulated frame, either link all base nodes directly (triangle), or introduce a fourth above (heightwise) to create secondary triangles and improve load bearing.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Loads place significant vertical and modest horizontal demand on node_3. Given (roller at node_2, pinned at node_1, roller at node_3), a simple triangular frame (connections: 1-2, 2-3, 3-1) is theoretically stable. However, large force at node_3 could cause high stress unless member directions align well with load, and unless areas are chosen carefully. Basing area selection on maximizing members aligned to the load path, while minimizing member count and total length (for mass limits). Failure mode: buckling (for compression), yielding (for tension), and overstressing of base members under the vertical load at node_3.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "A single triangle (all 3 nodes connected) is the statistical minimum, but with given node_3 close to node_1 (both on y=0), structural eccentricity is high, causing increased base members\' forces. To remedy, placing a 4th node elevated above base may better direct vertical components and reduce maximum member force, distributing load more equally and allowing for smaller areas (helping meet mass constraint). However, adding node counteracts the urge for extreme minimalism, and increases member total.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Add a new node above the base (let\'s call it node_4 at approx (3.0, y_h)), split the horizontal span, creating two triangles: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_2-node_3-node_4. Node_4 collects load from node_3 almost directly upwards, diagonals share stress, enabling thinner members, and disperses load better toward both supports. Connections: 1-3, 3-2, 2-4, 4-1, 3-4.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Member selection: use diagonal members (33-44 deg) primarily, strong in tension/compression. Compute coordinates for node_4 considering both area limits (~30 mass) and optimal load path (likely placing node_4 somewhat above node_3 for force pathing; estimate y_4 at 2.0). Lengths: use distance formula. For areas, use area values from set ensuring none are excessively over/understressed; adjust up if max(abs(stress))/weight > 0.75, else down for minimum mass. Stress by dividing each member force by its area. Use basic statics for force in each member (approximating truss by symmetry/static eqs.).",\n    \n    "calculation": "Place node_4 at (3.0, 2.0), which positions it nearly above node_3. All base lengths: node_1 to node_3 (2.0), node_3 to node_2 (4.0), node_2 to node_1 (6.0), node_3 to node_4 (distance root((3-2)^2 + (2-0)^2)=sqrt(1+4)=2.24), node_2 to node_4 (sqrt(3^2+2^2)=3.61), node_1 to node_4 (sqrt(3^2+2^2)=3.61). Total member length: 2+4+6+2.24+3.61+3.61=21.46 units. Assign diagonals and vertical (~2.2–3.6) area \'3\' (1.759), horizontals (?) \'2\' (0.782), or \'1\'. For mass: sum(length_i*area_i). Check that total mass~do not exceed 30, and largest member stress divided by mass less than 0.75. For this shape, vertical/diags with moderately high area (~2, ~0.782 or above). Area assignment (trial): base (6.0) gets area \'2\'=0.782, others diags get \'3\'=1.759, vertical (2.24) at node_4 with \'3\', sums up to: 6*0.782 + 2*1.759 + 4*0.782 + 2.24*1.759 + 3.61*1.759 + 3.61*1.759 = 4.692 + 3.518 + 3.128 + 3.943 + 6.353 + 6.353=27.99, just under the limit.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Final truss: four nodes, 6 members, all closed (connected).
