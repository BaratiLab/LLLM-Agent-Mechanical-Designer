Until now, all previous iterations violate the main stress-to-weight constraint, typically by a large margin due to under-provisioned areas in highly stressed members.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Review input: supports fixed, major loads on node_3, most constraint violations from high member forces, especially in horizontally-aligned low-area members. Objective: Run a single iteration leading to constraint satisfaction by adjusting member layout, areas, and leveraging triangulation.",\n\n    "analysis": "All prior candidates (history and current) overload one or more members, notably the shortest/most direct path between node_1 — node_3 and node_3 — node_2. Many hippocentric layouts attempt a top chord, but stress on central bottom members spikes above allowed using the smallest section (area 0.195 or 0.782). The structure is always light but far exceeds the stress-to-weight and maximum stress constraints. Only the most oversized (area_id=4 in constraint_not_met_2) structures survive but at huge mass cost, still just shy of constraints. The critical path for the applied oblique load at node_3 is from node_3 to node_1 and node_3 to node_2. The minimal area previously used consistently leaves these in excess stress.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "The most instructive historical case is constraint_not_met_2: a \'star\' with a central node_4 above nodes, all uprights connecting directly to loaded node. Its member areas are massively oversized (area_id=4); mass goes to ~27 and stress-to-weight ~1. But elasticity in layout/nodes is rarely exploited; loads could be better shared. Repeating patterns are overly long top members carrying little stress with short concentrated compressive lower members, overloaded unless oversized. Thus, area upgrades on stressed bottom/side members and refinements to node placement (raise upper chord above node_3) are key to satisfying the constraints.",\n\n    "proposal": "To minimize both mass and stress ratio, retain the basic geometry (support nodes fixed via boundary/loads), but reposition elevated/constrained nodes to maximize member length-to-area utilization and distribute load: (1) place a high central top node symmetrically (mirroring optimal Pratt/Warren truss geometry), (2) connect lower chord across node_1-node_3-node_2 and add diagonals from ends and node_3 to the top, creating triangles, and (3) allocate largest available area_id first (area_id \'2\'=0.782) to the bottom loaded member (\'node_1\'-\'node_3\'), and reinforce diagonals likely to share load. Leverage area variance—smaller sections for upper/top or less loaded members; right areas for high-force paths.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Specialized truss behaviors for a load at node_3 (2/3rd bottom) under supports at node_1, node_2, node_3 (latter is roller) mean node_3 must connect efficiently to supports and upper structure so that no member is over-compressed or tensioned above capability. Truss triangulation (Warren/pratt) and near equilateral triangles offer uniform stress spread. Raising the top node (node_4, at x=3, y~2.5), will increase vertical and horizontal members’ efficiency, keeping critical loaded members shorter (lower compression, allowing moderate sectional area usage). All loaded/support nodes remain fixed—as prescribed in instructions. Member selection starts with area_id \'2\' for high-stress bottom chord from node_1 to node_3; area \'1\' suffices for longer upper or bracing members.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumption: major load path is node_3 to node_1/2; vertical and diagonal components. Sequence: choose central top node_4 at (3,2.8) [control y for minimal chord forces], connect node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4, form diagonal braces node_1<->node_4<->node_2 and node_3<->node_4. Based on geometry: bottom chords (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2) with \'2\' area for heavy load, top/diagonals with \'1\'. Use the smallest size allowable except for bottom/high-stress members. Compute force approx. via methods of joints (pratt truss style): anticipate approx. max member force ~full resultant (32.02kN load), spread over two bottom chords forces each ~half the vector load (preliminary estimate: still requires area ~0.78 for constraints; larger if safety margin required). Estimated mass for 6m span: member_1 node_1-node_3 (length 2.0), member_2 node_3-node_2 (length 4.0), member_3 node_1-node_4, member_4 node_2-node_4, member_5 node_3-node_4 (use sqrt( (dx^2)+(dy^2)), totaling approx ~13m truss, with mixed area (weighted). All new members connect at all nodes, no isolated nodes, yielding a closed truss.",\n\n    "calculation": "Key member lengths: node_1-node_3 (2.0), node_3-node_2 (4.0), node_1-node_4 (sqrt(9+7.84)=4.20), node_2-node_4(same=4.20), node_3-node_4(sqrt(1+7.84)=2.83), base total member length: 2.0+4.0+4.20+4.20+2.83 = 17.23. Assign area_id \'2\' (0.782) for the horizontal bottom chords node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2; rest area_id \'1\' (0.195). Masses (member_length*area): main bottom chords=2.0*0.782+4.0*0.782= 4.68; top/diags: 4.20*0.195*2=1.64, 2.83*0.195=0.55, total mass=4.68+1.64+0.55=6.87 < 30. Maximum loaded member stress: for node_1-node_3 or node_3-node_2, stress is slightly below full applied force/section area, so 32kN/0.782=40.92 (using max possible force); stress-to-weight ratio is max(40.92)/6.87=5.95, above constraint! To reduce this, next-larger member size: area_id \'4\'=3.128 for bottom chords. Recalculate: mass = 2*2.0*3.128+2.0*3.128=18.77 in bottom chords; add rest =1.64+0.55=2.19; mass total=20.96 < 30. Stress/static = 32/3.128 = 10.23. Stress-to-weight = 10.23/20.96=0.49 (inside bounds!). Optionally set area_id \'2\'=0.782 or \'4\'=3.128 depending on smallest feasible. Result: bottom chords get area_id \'4\', others area_id \'1\'.
