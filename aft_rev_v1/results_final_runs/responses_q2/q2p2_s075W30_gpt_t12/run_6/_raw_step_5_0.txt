All historic schemes keep supports and load locations constant. The optimization now targets a minimal, closed arrangement that evenly distributes the imposed load while dramatically reducing peak member stresses and total self-weight.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given: load at node_3, supports on nodes 1, 2, 3 (pinned and rollers, node id, fixed). Max abs(stress)/total_weight ≤ 0.75. Total mass must remain under 30. Current/historic members see overstress especially along lower \'span\' members. Overdoned topologies are too heavy to offset individual member overloading.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Most constraint breaches result from high local forces in one or two lower-chord members (usually directly under node_3). In every failed configuration, max stress frequently ranges in [27.6, 59] while total mass is generally favorable. Completed triangles improve force transfer, but when area optimization is too aggressive (areas \'1\', \'2\'), some crucial members overload while total mass is kept low — a classic configurational undersizing issue. Historic trade-offs using larger areas all cause gross mass increases, not solving the ratio constraint. The persistent attempt to flatten node_3 (with applied load) in the chord is another problem: directly applied shear-compression-tension across a nearly straight line guarantees local stress peaks. Ascending arch or \'Warren\'-like truss triangulated up at node_3 with short members suited to distribute the load into redundant symmetric paths, will minimize penalty member load.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Staggered planar triangle (triangles through supports and node_3, regularizing top node positions for symmetry) seems ideal. Minimizing the direct length of stressed members under load, while maximizing utilization of the largest area grades only in directly loaded members as needed, may both lower max stress and even out internal actions. Connect every support node and node_3 into a hierarchical triangle pointing up. Constraints require acceptance of slightly increased total member number but the payoff in reduced max|stress| seems preferable. Avoid over-reducing areas.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign as a minimal, symmetric, closed, upward-pointed Warren truss spanning 6 units with the central node slightly above supports to distribute node_3’s load most evenly. Retain node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0) as per supports/loads. Minor y-elevation for midspan nodes (nodes_4, nodes_5) above support chord enables closure and controlled internal angle reduction. Only lightly increase member areas in chords (<2), use area = \'3\' or above in vertical/upright central strut transmitting main portion of load downward.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Symmetry ensures equal path lengths for force division under the point load at node_3; upper arch and lower chords function as both tension/compression chords alternately for force resolution. Compact triangles above the chord redirect most of the vertical loading into the supports swiftly, keeping member stresses uniformly moderate with minimal overweighting. Crucial is not to shortcut area in midspan vertical/load-taker members; sidelined areas can be < \'2\' elsewhere.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Steps: 1) Place two new nodes, left and right top chords ((1.0,2.1), (5.0,2.1)); slight asymmetry allowed under constraints. 2) Connect node_3 upwards for force split using area \'3\' or \'4\' in directly loaded members. Check total mass with proposed areas: ~7 members at lengths (sqrt sums, all below 6 units), choose most as area=\'1\' except main post. Precompute lengths and sum with section areas to target m ≤ 20. Split top triangle for further stress share.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Nodes: node_1: (0,0), node_2: (6,0), node_3: (2,0), node_4: (1,2.1) left, node_5: (5,2.1) right. Members: lower chords (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2), top chords (node_4-node_5), uprights (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_5), diagonals (node_4-node_3, node_5-node_3). Main loaded member node_3-node_4 area \'3\'. Area selection elsewhere: diagonals \'1\', chords \'2\'. Each length ~2–6 units. Compute mass: eg., member_1: (2 units, 0.195), member_2: (~2.24, 1.759), sum all. All likely m≲20, most loaded member (at node_3-4, via force split, ≤15kN) sees stress ≈F/A=(~15)/(1.759) ≈8.5, which in structure of ~20 mass gives ratio ≤0.5—constraints satisfied.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Final configuration: fully closed, 7-member symmetric Warren, compact, efficient.
