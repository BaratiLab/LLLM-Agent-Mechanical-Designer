Nodal coordinates at supports/load application must remain fixed. All members must be correctly area-typed to minimize mass but ensure stress remains compliant. Previous designs concentrate excessive force near node_3, often overstressing the bottom chord.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Looking at current and prior generation attempts:\\n- All prior designs fail the (max stress / mass) <= 0.75 constraint, primarily due to under-massed bottom or direct load path members, or poor triangulation, often resulting in minimal but heavily loaded \'direct\' trusses. Massive decreases to stress do occur (e.g., constraint_not_met_1 or 2) but at huge mass penalties. Most historical geometry is unoptimized, lacks effective force dispersion above node_3 (where a heavy downward–left load acts). Successful strategies will triangulate, use a Warren or Pratt configuration, and assign high-section members diagonally to major load carriers (especially members intercepting node_3\'s load path).\\n- Connections between supports and load, via spatially distributed raised nodes, disperse loads. Extending height and efficient triangulation above the main span, and keeping as few but sufficient nodes and members as possible, is essential for constraint and weight control. Support constraints (node_1: pinned, node_2/node_3: roller) prevent support re-positioning.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Current attempts under-mass main load-path members to minimize mass, causing stress to skyrocket. High-mass configurations oversaturate all members, inflating redundancy. A more controlled mound (polygonal) truss possible: a raised layout, lighter top chord, compact triangle units with thicker diagonals or direct strut to node_3. Deleting unnecessary cross/verticals reduces mass.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign from scratch, introducing only five nodes—three at supports/load, and two mid-height for triangulation above the base span. Deploy a symmetric \'Pratt-like\' truss: bottom chord: node_1–node_3–node_2; two ‘roof’ nodes at (a high and right, a high and left); diagonal direct members distributing node_3’s load up and out. Key: assign only critical diagonals a larger area. All members connected — forming closed triangles linking support, node_3 and both upper new midspan nodes.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Symmetric, Pratt-type trusses are optimal for single-point oblique loads (modifying for offset). By raising midspan, inclining diagonals toward support, and favoring minimal node heights while avoiding excessive redundancy, we minimize both stress and total mass. Allocation: bottom members at smallest permitted area, through diagonals for direct path with larger area (critical load path), and less loaded vertical/secondary diagonals at minimal area. Upward node positions must avoid amplifying span length—or as high as required to sufficiently reduce diagonal member force. Force distribution will take load up diagonal from node_3 → (apex left and right), transmit down to node_1 and node_2. This provides geometric stiffness, short load paths, balanced with minimal overall steel used.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions:\\n- Member section areas: select \'2\' (0.782), \'1\' (0.195), ‘3’ (1.759).\\n- Maintain node_1: (0.0,0.0), node_2: (6.0,0.0), node_3: (2.0,0.0).\\n- Place node_4 and node_5 at (mid/right/left, modestly elevated). Place node_4 left-top near node_1–node_3, node_5 right-top near node_2–node_3 intersection. Set height to 1.8—2.3m range (taller than previously to lengthen diagonals, lower their force for given load direction).\\n- All nodes connected in triangles (no disconnect). Only most-stressed members (diagonals intercepting node_3) in higher area.\\n- For calculation, estimate member lengths, sum total mass, compare with past (target < 10 for comfort). Compute stress in critical diagonal (must keep < 0.75 × mass).
