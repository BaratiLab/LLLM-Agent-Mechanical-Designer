    "preamble": "This truss problem seeks an optimal, closed 2D configuration to resist an external load on node_3, while being supported at nodes 1, 2 (pinned/roller) and node_3 (roller), and minimizing the stress-to-weight ratio below 0.75 with total mass ≤ 30 units.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Current and historic designs exceed the allowed stress-to-weight ratio of 0.75 or introduce overstressed slender members. The main goal is to redistribute load more efficiently to all supports, enhance triangulation, ensure closure, and eliminate excessively stressed light members. Some member areas are poorly chosen for local force/mass ratio.",
    
    "analysis": "The present design has concentrated stresses in chord (horizontal) members (e.g., -27.64 in member_4) with light area ('1'), producing a high stress-to-weight ratio roughly at the constraint, but not below it. The historical design attempts a steeper triangle, but overcompresses a light chord and has a higher stress/wt. ratio. Key issues include underdeveloped triangulation, non-minimal load paths, redundant masses in heavy vertical members, and misallocation of lightest cross-sections to most heavily loaded spans. Load path inspection also reveals insufficient redundancy and suboptimal spatial geometry; major horizontal spans under heavy stress due to bending action. The limited areas ('1', 0.195) for most horizontal members are unacceptable under the induced forces.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "Better triangulation and mobilizing midspan verticals/diagonals will relieve heavily loaded horizontal chords. Warm up the triangles for true truss action: raise/shift top node to steep slope, stiffen diagonals with minimal but ‘safe’ sections; assign larger cross-section to high-force members. Do not change supported node positions. Reallocate material—avoid excessive use of area '4' (heavy, unnecessary for lightly loaded verticals). Keep closure to enforce rigidity.",
    
    "proposal": "Redesign the structure by introducing a fifth node above and between the supports (midspan elevated node), and expand to a Pratt-style configuration. Create true triangulation: two steep diagonals from supports to this node and the loaded node, vertical from midspan apex down, and light bottom chords, bolstering heavy-force regions with higher area. Select area sections based on likely maximum force per member using approximate equilibrium. This leverages all support locations and load transfer paths more efficiently than the current/prev. designs.",
    
    "reasoning": "Symmetric truss design (Pratt/Warren–type hybrid): By lifting the cross-member/sharing the horizontal bottom chord load through multiple structurally active triangles, big compressive forces will shift to newly created steeper diagonals (lower member force, needing more reasonable cross-section). Additional nodes at midspan top (node_5) with x=3.0 propagate triangulation, while existing constraints keep end nodes fixed. Bottom chord members remain for closure. Member section size chosen to bound stress per area below ~0.75 × Mass—solve for most critical triangle using vertical/horizontal reactions.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume load at node_3 is (-15, -30) (so total 33.54 kN). Place new node_5 at apex (x=3, y=2.1)—steep for enhanced triangulation, y-top set for positive area and moment relief, sufficient height to flatten member forces. Assign higher areas on steepest diagonals and shorter verticals. Base cross-sectional area decisions on adjacent node forces, heavy at critical sections, small where direct force pass-through is minimal.",
    
    "calculation": "Estimate: use new node_5 (3.0, 2.1). Find approx. forces: bottom chord (supports span of 6.0m—diagonals approx. length = sqrt(3^2 + 2.1^2) ≈ 3.67m), vertical members ≈ 2.1m each. For load at node_3 transfer, expect major force transfer to member_3_5 (diagonal): assume up to half load in compression/tension. Assign area '4' (for diagonals; local force ~15-20; stress-to-area <7) and area '1' (for less loaded bottom/verticals). Total mass now: sum(each_member_length × area_dict[area_id]). This configuration disperses forces better. Chord at node_3 with '2' as safety.",
    "scratch_pad_final": "Verify: stress-to-weight must decrease—done by load sharing and heavier area at diagonal. Total mass is manageable provided moderate area sizes ('1'-'4'). Nodes with supports and load are untouched. All nodes are structurally linked (closure confirmed). Avoid overpush on any member (long chord). Geometry avoids extreme slenderness.",
