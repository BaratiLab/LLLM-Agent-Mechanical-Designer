Objective: devise a closed triangular truss, minimize stress-to-weight ratio <= 0.75, and uphold total mass constraint (<=30). Areas are chosen from a discrete specification. Node connectivity, triangulation, and effective load path design are exercised.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Only three nodes supplied, at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0). The load, acting on node_3, is not vertical — it\'s (-15,-30), meaning the force acts up/leftwards. Supports: pinned at left, roller at right and interior. Classical three-bar triangular truss seems best; closing it with triangles maximizes path redundancy/stability and load sharing. Keeping everything coplanar and confined to specified positions.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Supports analysis: \'pinned\' (full support) at node_1 fixes two DOFs; \'roller\' at node_2 restrains y only (x free); \'roller\' at node_3 again restrains y (x free). The load is applied to node_3 at a steep angle. For optimal force management, main compressive/tension-carrying elements should act along/directly opposed to the load\'s action where possible, i.e., orientation from node_3 to node_1 (direct tie), node_3 to node_2, node_1 to node_2, creating the canonical triangle. With minimum area across less-stressed horizontal member (node_1 to node_2), distribute additional area where highest stresses anticipated (loaded elements: node_1<>node_3, node_2<>node_3). Turning this into a closed truss (triangle) is auspicious for both effectiveness and constraint satisfaction.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Direct connection (triangulation) supporting node_3 will help to deal with the load. Consider load path: diagonal load targets both supports, invoking force in both non-horizontal truss members: node_3-node_1 and node_3-node_2. The bottom (horizontal) solves the geometry for closure, carries mostly shifting force. Maximum force likely in diagonals (compression/tension) depending on load splitting; area optimization should target these savings.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Design a single, robust closed triangle (no need to add new nodes, since no significant restraint improvement occurs given tightly grouped nodes and single load). Force flow within each member can be analyzed statically. Assign the largest permissible area ID to maximally loaded members only if needed otherwise minimize member areas for lower-weight, especially for the bottom chord. Given systemic size ratio, area_ID constraint, and low number of members, this layout stays below the weight/stress threshold with precise selection.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Force decomposition: The load at node_3 is (-15,-30). Compute force in each member using static equilibrium:\\n- Let L13: node_1 to node_3, L23: node_2 to node_3, L12: node_1 to node_2. Their directions and lengths: L13 = sqrt((2-0)^2 + (0-0)^2)=2.0m, L23=sqrt((6-2)^2)=4.0m, L12=6.0m.\\n\\nDevelop joint balance equations at node_3:\\nLet the force in N13 be F1 (to node_1), N23 be F2 (to node_2), both as unknowns, decomposition based on geometry.

There is no vertical geometry separation — the triangle collapses. This suggests node_3 must be shifted vertically for force balance. Least alteration: introduce a new node_4 at (2.0,2.5) (moving above line), preserving the original three and providing vertical space. \\nSo new node_dict: node_4: (2,2.5). Re-connect nodes: members = n1-n4, n2-n4, n1-n2, n3-n4, ensuring all physical requirements are satisfied and all nodes are connected. \\nNow compute member lengths: n1-n4: sqrt((2-0)^2+(2.5-0)^2)=3.2016, n2-n4: sqrt((6-2)^2 + (2.5-0)^2)=4.7202, n1-n2=6.0, n3-n4=2.5\\nSelect areas for high stress members \'2\'(0.782) for n1-n4 and n2-n4, \'1\'(0.195) for others.

All supplied nodes connected via added node, matching problem requirement. Calculated member lengths and area assignations keep mass well below the constraint.
