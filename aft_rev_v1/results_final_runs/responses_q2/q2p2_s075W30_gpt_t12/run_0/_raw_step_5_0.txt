The current and historic designs all violate the max stress-to-weight ratio despite generally lightweight/efficient mass values.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The initial structures are designed as planar trusses with triangular bracing but consistently exceed the allowed stress-to-weight ratio, usually by overstressing the horizontal member between nodes 1-3 or 3-2. Current designs trend toward high local forces and slack in auxiliary (diagonal, upper) member contribution.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The loading is localized and eccentric: node_3 (2.0, 0.0) receives a large downward (-30) and leftward (-15) load; the supports include pinned at left (node_1: (0,0) pinned), rollers at node_2 (6.0,0.0) and node_3 (2.0,0.0). This creates a sharp moment near node_3, with significant vertical and horizontal member force. Prior designs either have a heavily loaded bottom chord (1-3-2) or try to split verticals and horizontals but fail to spread force via efficient triangulation. Often, the auxiliary members are insufficiently engaged structurally, causing great stress in the base chord. Additionally, area selections for high-force members are not always optimal given the discrete set of possible area_id values. Historic overloading focuses on the midspan element from node_1 to node_3 (with stress > allowed). The truss extends tall verticals above node_3 to upper points allowing shallow angle top chords, but did not optimize force sharing.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Improvement must reduce high local force on lower chords, likely by increasing triangulation to improve load paths, moving top chords higher over node_3, or adding a midspan upper vertical. Tweaking area_id alone will not suffice if the force path channels too much stress into a few members. Triangular units above/below node_3 can spread loads, while minimizing length of chords with heavy force will benefit weight constraint. Additional checked configurations should maximize triangle depth centered over loaded node_3.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss: raise the apex (upper chord) to above node_3 (symmetrically) to reduce long horizontal member force, add two new top-chord nodes for more symmetrical triangles, and ensure continuous triangulation from node_1 to node_2. Use larger area members for the most heavily loaded horizontal chord and select appropriate minimum weight area_id for compression/diagonal members to spread the forces. Avoid oversloping angles (shorter diagonals mean stiffer system) while preserving clear support staging. Specifically, introduce node_4 at (3.0,3.4) centered above node_3 and nodes_5 and _6 either side (1.1,2.1) and (4.9,2.1) to triangularize with the three lower chord nodes. Use area_id \'2\' for base chords (as before), and area_id \'1\' for non-critical diagonal/upper, adjusting up as needed if calculations show overstress.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By adding a central top joint and two adjacent nodes, I split the truss into nearly equilateral triangles, distributing force efficiently from load to supports. This reduces stress concentration, maximizes vertical strength through triangle geometry, and allows for intermediate bars (vertical/diagonal) to share force. Retaining existing support nodes preserves requirements. Priortize area_id allocations using force predicted along each member: assign higher section size only if needed. Use as compact a vertical differential as possible without flatness, to prevent bending amplification.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "1. Rigidly fixing supports and load locations, introduce three upper nodes: central (node_4, over node_3), left upper (node_5), right upper (node_6). 2. All non-basal nodes to be above y = 2.0, but keep shallow enough to hold total length/mass low. Assume load is distributed via vertical increases in compression on diagonals and less on bottom. 3. Connect every node to create continuous triangulated closed structure; no member exceeds 3.5 units in length. 4. Set bottom chords to \'2\' area; diagonals and minors \'1\', leveling up only if constraint still not met. 5. Estimate member forces by static force analysis — load at node_3 shared up and out; diagonals in moderate compression/tension in load path center. 6.
