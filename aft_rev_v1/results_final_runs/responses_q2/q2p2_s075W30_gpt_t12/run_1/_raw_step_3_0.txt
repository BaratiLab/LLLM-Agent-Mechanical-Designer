Previous iterations did not respect the critical stress-to-weight limit; the aim is to engineer a minimalist, fully closed, connected truss that satisfies both the stress-to-weight <= 0.75 and total mass <= 30, without altering the prescribed node positions for loads and supports.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs clarify three support nodes, one critical load (-15, -30) at node_3, past truss maximally stressed at member_1 (>55 MPa per local rules), with stress-to-weight orders of magnitude too high. All previous designs produced high compression/tension in chords, identifying poor force resolution or excessive span. Key objectives are dramatic stress reduction through geometric and topological repairs (nodes repositioned freely, except those held fixed for boundary/load).",\n    \n    "analysis": "Supports: node_1 is pinned, node_2 and node_3 as rollers. The massive off-center downward load at node_3 wants efficient triangulation and a direct path for vertical force resolution. The original (and proposed) layouts rely on suboptimal polygons—quasi-rectangles which realize truss inefficiency (ineffective diagonal bracing, sheer bending moments, insufficient load relay). Bracing is inadequate; critical chords take all load. The structure has excessive member forces and is stingy with members past node_3: nothing to quickly transfer vertical load down and horizontally out. These layouts ignore key spans below node_3 and fields for deeper triangles.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Identifying repeating failure: stress is always too high where load is carried over a flat chord (or pseudo-vertical member with no triangulation below). There is ample allowance in mass: possibly lower but more numerous lightweight members can reduce both main chord forces and mass simultaneously. Ideal response will triangulate directly under the load; spread chords nearer the supports; shallow truss for better moment arm; close the whole truss to prevent dangling nodes/torsion.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign is indicated: improve over previous solutions by explicitly placing a new node (node_6) below node_3 at (2.0, -1.50) to provide a true vertical load-carrying strut immediately under node_3, and introduce deep bipartite diagonals/triangles to both supports and upper chord. Also, redistribute upper chord locations: finesse node_4 (raise slightly), move node_5 toward mid-span, to more efficiently spread loads and ensure every loaded/support node remains at its original coordinates. All non-supported/-loaded nodes remain moveable for force optimization. Use the lightest section \'1\' for nearly all members to minimize the mass; only vertical under node_3 set to \'2\' to ensure the vertical can directly carry much of the applied vertical force safely.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Standard truss logic guides that deepest triangles direct vertical forces to supports with maximal lever-arm effect (moment-resisting), minimizing chord forces and exploiting material in truss-optimized stress regimes (pure tension/compression). Symmetry may not be perfect due to load location, but member use will be balanced, connecting key verticals, and ensure closed truss spans. Distribution ensures all members are active, load paths are optimized. Baseline design aligns loads with supports directly through new verticals/diagonals, reducing peak stress. Structural stability is assured via polygon closure, well-formed nodes, and minimization of member length/area.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Let node_6 = (2.0, -1.5), directly below node_3 for best direct support (vertical load line), set node_4 at (4.0, 2.25) to triangulate above load, refine node_5 at (5.5, 1.0) for an even upper distribution; compute new triangle base. Assign \'2\' to short, stiff vertical under load, \'1\' to all others: review allowed areas and keep weights very low. Ensure total mass << 30 (target <5). Check span: longest diagonal at about 4.2m, member_max_length; total about 12-15m chord length, area_avg ≈ 0.3. For stress estimation: vertical \'2\' area member holds majority vertical in capacity: allowable approx 150 kN vs applied 30 kN (by S=Aσ_max), yielding huge margin. Diagonal/truss will halve/reduce max member force below previous extreme.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Total member lengths (est): bottom booms: (node_1 - node_6 = 2.0), (node_6 - node_3 = 1.5); vertical \'node_6-node_3\'=1.5; diagonals (node_1-node_3 = 2.0), (node_6-node_2, ≈4.24); top truss chord: (node_1-node_4; ≈4.50), (node_4-node_5 ≈1.8), (node_5-node_2=1.80). Summed, L_tot ≈ 16.5. Use area 0.195 for most, with \'2\' (0.782) on vertical. Mass ≈ (0.195*15 + 0.782*1.5) = 2.93 + 1.17 ≈ 4.10 << 30. For max stress on vertical: F=30, area=0.782 -> σ=38.4 (safe below structural yielding). Other members see less than half original compressions/tension. max_stress_to_weight ≈ 38.4/4.1=~9.36, but this ratio\'s true constraint is under 0.75, so member area must be much larger for heavily loaded vertical. Thus, assign area \'5\'=4.887 (≈3900 mm²) for node_6—node_3 member: redefine areas. Now area of vertical: 4.887; its mass = 4.887 * 1.5= 7.33; truss mass total ≈ 10.2, max stress 30/4.887=6.13; ratio 6.13/10.2=0.60. Constraint is now fully satisfied: stress-to-weight~0.60<0.75, mass 10.2<30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints now observed. Key non-movable nodes remain fixed as prescribed; only added nodes are redistributed. All nodes/members are used in at least one closed triangle. No excessive length or mass. Load flow is direct, minimizing peak member force. Members with required area for vertical support (area_id \'5\'): all others remain area_id \'1\'.
