Supports/loads/nodes must not be disturbed, but overall geometry can be improved for efficiency and constraint compliance. Current/historic solutions are all constraint-violating.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Observed system: Skewed trapezoidal plans, vertical-loads at node_3, all prior configurations fail max stress/gross inefficiency, even if their mass is low. Area assignments often don\'t compensate for force. Both layout and area sizing can be improved.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Support layout: nodes_1 (pinned), 2/3 (rollers). Major downward & leftward load at node_3; symmetrical support at node_1, with side/vertical thrust resisted at other supports. Current/historic trusses contain obtuse triangles or insufficient direct bracing between supports and load nodes. Current mass: 16.7 (within limit), but stress-to-mass ratio (0.8859) fails (should be ≤\xa00.75). Analysis shows member_1 (from node_1 to node_3) is overloaded (-14.80). Previous lighter-mass attempts used thinner sections but resulted in even worse overstress (e.g., member_1 at -53.9). Members not directly bracing the high load are lightly stressed and provide low structural utility. Vertical raise of node_5 (current node_5 at [3.0, 3.9]) seems somewhat effective, but max member stresses are still too high.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Pattern: Overstress persists where triangulation is not focused directly on resolving the combined vertical and horizontal load into efficiently placed supports. Solution: Bracing node_3 to the apex of a triangle above the supports, reduce overall span, optimize member sizing, and redistribute some member area to those directly resisting the worst load (node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, and their bridging braces). Consider introducing a new apex above node_3, enabling better force balance, sharper triangles for geometric stability, and efficient section usage.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign for strict minimum: use a classic statically-determinate triangle (Warren/Pratt form), wherein a new node is placed directly above or nearly above node_3 to serve as a high apex, creating two distinct load paths from apex to both pinned and roller supports. All loads (both vertical and lateral at node_3) thus resolve via straight struts. Use area assignment primarily on highly loaded members, selecting \'3\' or \'4\' (1.759 or 3.128) for diagonal compression/tension, and \'1\' (0.195) for lighter braces. Maintain closures for complete truss, but avoid redundant linking that adds mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "This optimized prism truss, a statically determined triangle above the support line, directly transfers both lateral and vertical load components from node_3 (with apex alignment near midpoint,) toward both supports, ensuring proper triangulation—closing structural triangles and enabling each member to make efficient use of material. Equilibrate apex placement for even stress distribution, avoid long flat members (higher force, longer lever arm), focus area/mass on loaded diagonals, minimize less-used in-plane members.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume new node_4 at (3.0, 3.8), an apex located above load node_3 (load at [2.0, 0.0]). Main connections: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_4-node_3, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_2. Select areas minimizing mass but ensuring key members are not overstressed. Estimated maximum direct load on diagonal brace node4-node3: sqrt(15²+30²) ≈ 33.5 → If  area=1.759 or higher and member length ≈ 3.93, stress < 33.5/1.759 ≈ 19, but total mass with selective upgrades remains comfortably <30. Expect max member force ≲ 15 with good geometry and area selection. All critical load transfer zones (apex to supports, supports to load node) are short and straight. Section summary: diagonal compression/tension areas size up (3/4), others minimal (1). Triangulated closure, zero isolated node risk.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Primary load from node_3 vector immediately resolved along diagonal node_3 → node_4 → node_1 and node_4 → node_2 paths. Place node_4 at (3, 3.8); lengths: node_3-node_4: sqrt(1²+3.8²) ≈ 3.93, node_1-node_3: 2.00, node_1-node_4: sqrt(3²+3.8²) ≈ 4.84; node_2-node_4: sqrt(3²+3.8²) ≈ 4.84; node_4 at geometric center to minimize imbalance.
