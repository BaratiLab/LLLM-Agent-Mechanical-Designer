Recently tested and historic structures all failed, mainly from excessive local member stresses (esp. at midspan) compared to their masses. The objective is a feasible, efficient truss that passes constraints, maximizing efficiency and structural soundness.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives are clear: stress-to-weight ratio < 0.75, mass < 30. Loads are only on node_3, with pinned (node_1), roller (nodes_2,3) supports fixed. Prior attempts failed for overstressed, lightly-massed members; stress > 51 (limit should be ~22 max) for current total mass ~14.6, so over half that can\'t be in max-stress. The problem location is likely in the connections/geometry near load input node_3. Triangulating and connecting load path, while using slightly higher cross-sectional area for high-force members, should drive stress down while only modestly increasing total mass.",\n    \n    "analysis": "---DETAIL---\\nSupports:\\n - node_1 (pinned, 0,0): resists both x, y.\\n - node_2 (roller, 6,0): vertical only.\\n - node_3 (roller+load, 2,0): likely just vertical only.\\n\\nLoad at node_3: (-15, -30) ⇒ primary downward, some leftward.\\n\\nPreviously, central member (\'node_1\'-\'node_3\') or (\'node_3\'-\'node_4\') see huge stresses, due to singling out sensitive long or direct \'web\' members under load. Area IDs on those (historically \'1\' or \'2\') were too low, relative to force paths. Triangles with apex top nodes (nodes_4, etc.) were inefficient, lacking spread to transfer loads to bottom supports effectively—they choked load into few members.\\n\\nEarlier structures tried flat top chords or vertical lifts; stress propagated to certain short diagonal or vertical elements. Areas on non-critical elements wasted mass. Where triangulation wasn\'t optimal (empty webs, \'bottleneck\' shapes), stress-to-weight rose.\\n\\nIn essence: 1) TB and side webs hold most stress -> need bigger area; 2) Use just enough area elsewhere to close up and stabilize panels without overweight penalization. Improved distribution can let most overloaded \'web\' members carry stress as they will be appropriately sized. Also, they must form minimal, fully triangulated web between all supports/loads—minimal nodes, strong triangles, correct targeting of sizes.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Main concern: a common issue in histories (and in the latest trial) is overloading of \'node_1\'-\'node_3\' or midspan connections—the classic place for max moment under a downward load near mid-bottom. Next: cross-sectional areas varied rigidly. The best designs close the structure, replicating classic bridge truss web: minimum nodes, apex/top node at correct altitude, and diagonals proportioned to direct axial force path toward both supports. Efficient area allocation is crucial. If we slightly move the \'apex\' upper node closer toward node_3 (shifting the peak), and up the area only for \'node_1\'-\'node_3\' and diagonals closest to loading, stress will redistribute to stay under limit, with a minor mass increase.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign geometry for more efficient span, close the web, and increase member area id ONLY on highest-force members. Shift the upper node_4 upward and slightly left from previous (e.g., [2.8, 2.8]), triangulate better across all supports, use minimum necessary areas elsewhere. Maintain historic nodes as supports and load-app sites, no move. Result is a classic two-panel Warren or Pratt truss applied to shortest path, with areas adapted to anticipated force/panel—and minimal excess material.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Minimum-mass trusses handling off-centered load should direct load through short, stiff triangles to both supports without relying on overstressed flat panels. Placing a single top node_4 near the sum of force directions adjusting for moment arm (say, at [2.8,2.8]), then tying all three base nodes to this with solid diagonals, creates classic triangulation with direct force transit. Strengthen \'node_1\'-\'node_3\', \'node_3\'-\'node_4\', and \'node_2\'-\'node_4\' with proper area ID (ID \'3\' or \'4\' on these, \'1\' elsewhere), keeping weight closely controlled but low risk of exceeding max stress value.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions:\\n- Increase top node height: y~2.8, x~2.8 for better angle transmission.\\n- Triangulate: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4.\\n- Strongest IDs on vertically-oriented members near the midspan (near where vertical load enters/exists structure), rest minimum permitted (\'1\').\\n- Keep all previous supports/nodes fixed per instructions.\\n- Chose areas as: Member \'node_1\'-\'node_3\': \'4\', \'node_1\'-\'node_4\':\'3\', \'node_3\'-\'node_4\':\'3\', all others \'1\'.\\n- Lengths: approx (in units): bottom spans: 2~4, diagonals: sqrt((3-2)^2 + 2.8^2), top: 3. Use l × a for total mass (with a as area param per ID).\\nCross check: if critical members don\'t exceed target stress for relevant shapes. Members with most of applied force will be those along the main triangle carrying toward supports and apex.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Key members: \\n- node_3 has load: x=-15, y=-30. Ludicrous stress in old tests; so, allocate mass to catch both x/y components. By geometry: diagonals to apex take much/direct path of both vectors.\\n\\nForce in (node_3, node_4): Using vertical and horizontal projection, almost all Fy runs up (node_3, node_4)->(node_2,node_4), then to bottom supports. \'node_1\', at 0,0, will absorb the leftward (Fx) in its side triangles, including \'node_1\'-\'node_3\'. These take the plan brunt. Assign area ID as:\\n- \'member_1\': node_1-node_2: \'1\'  (bottom chord, lightly loaded,\\n- \'member_2\': node_1-node_4: \'3\' (major force transfer)\\n- \'member_3\': node_2-node_4: \'3\' (right support)\\n- \'member_4\': node_1-node_3: \'4\' (largest load mass path)\\n- \'member_5\': node_2-node_3: \'1\'\\n- \'member_6\': node_3-node_4: \'3\'\\n\\nEstimate length sums, areas and resulting total mass {check sum for mass under budget}. Maximum stress will fall in member_4, with increased area keeping σ < 22 (@ 0.75 × total weight ~ 18-30, so target, max σ ~14).
