The objective is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio (max(|stress|)/total_weight), ensure structure mass does not exceed 30 units, and that all nodes are part of a single, closed, triangulated configuration. All imposed support and loading conditions must be satisfied.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given: A base frame with one pinned and two roller supports. One node (\'node_3\') is subjected to significant off-diagonal forces. We must connect all nodes in a singly connected, closed path, such that all members bear relatively balanced stress and minimum total mass. Only specific cross-sectional area_IDs can be assigned. New nodes can be added if beneficial.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The input truss is underdetermined and has insufficient triangulation: members along the horizontal axis alone cannot resist the provided inclined forces at \'node_3\' without large bending or axial loads. As only three colinear nodes are available (all on y=0), through direct load path, members will have to work under large tension/compression, increasing max stress. Adding an elevated fourth node (forming a triangle above the x-axis) creates robust, triangular bracing. This helps efficiently transmit vertical/horizontal forces while minimizing member stress and weight by dividing force paths.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Building a triangle above x-axis enables load commutation mainly via axial action and triangulation—much more structurally efficient than direct horizontal connections. Colinear nodes yield poor force resolution and high local member forces. Placement of a new node (\'node_4\') above base increases height (lever arm) to help reduce required members\' force capacity (less stress for same load). All nodes → closed path → triangle: (\'node_1\', \'node_3\', \'node_4\'), plus a lower tie, then (\'node_4\', \'node_2\'), creates a single closed truss. All supports and loads properly connected.",\n\n    "reasoning": "I\'ll create a triangular truss (a right-triangle) above the base three, with the apex directly above the mid-span of \'node_1\' and \'node_2\'. This provides symmetric load paths, smaller span for top members, maximum triangulation, and good distribution of loads. The force at \'node_3\' will split along two members (\'node_3\'–\'node_1\', \'node_3\'–\'node_4\'), each at a favorable angle, reducing the peak force any one member carries. Area sizes will be optimized based on shortest stressed top/ties needing less area; longest base with moderate area. Final geometry will maintain all original keys/positions for node_1, node_2, node_3.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Unit density, stress is axial = Force/Area. Member self-weight may be ignored given the low mass (unless calculated explicitly, will be negligible). System should be statically determinate. Add node_4 at high enough y, say (3.0, 2.25) directly above the centroid to maximize the triangulation effect and ensure constraints. Members: 1:node_1-node_3, 2:node_3-node_2, 3:node_2-node_4, 4:node_4-node_1, 5:node_3-node_4 (additional diagonals for full closure). For the given load, forces will resolve via method-of-joints or statics equations. Area IDs will be chosen as smallest possible, subject to peak stress (max(|Force|/Area) < 0.75×Mass). Member lengths calculated via distance formula.",\n\n    "calculation": "Truss geometry: node_1 (0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0); add node_4 at (3,2.25). Lengths: node_1-node_3: 2m, node_3-node_2: 4m, node_2-node_4: sqrt(3^2+2.25^2)=3.75m, node_4-node_1: sqrt(9+5.0625)=3.72m, node_3-node_4: sqrt(1^2+2.25^2)=2.46m. Total length ≈ 2+4+3.75+3.72+2.46 = 15.93m. All members triangulated, no mechanism. Estimate forces: (only rough, method-of-joints, neglecting minor self-weight). Highest force along \'node_3\'-\'node_4\' diagonal, likely max tension since this is directly pulling at ~-15,-30; angle arctan(2.25/1)=66º; thus, projection resolves ≈ 33 kN along diagonal, so stress per area. Try area_id \'4\' = 3.128 for most loaded (~1/10 stress, maximally utilizing mass constraint). Other members (less loaded)—try \'1\' = 0.195 minimal viable area. Masses: (2×0.195)+(4×0.782)+(3.75×0.195)+(3.72×0.195)+(2.46×3.128)=0.39+3.13+0.73+0.72+7.70 ≈ 12.67. Stress_to_weight: estimate (max stress say 33/3.128≈10.56 ≤0.75×12.67≈9.50—too high). Increase highest member area_id to \'5\' (4.887), stress now 33/4.887=6.75 ≤9.50. Total mass: 2.46×4.887+rest≈12.04+rest=~17—ALL CONSTRAINTS MET. All connections direct, effective, closed form.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Review: All nodes in a single connected form, all members triangulated, constraints on stress-to-weight and mass satisfied with room to spare. Members have minimal but sufficient area based on estimated forces. Location of node_4 balances load path a bit closer to \'node_3\' for better stress reduction. No unconnected members or redundant nodes; all must-and-only-where-needed members present. Solution is robust: if further reduction in peak-stress/weight needed, minor increases in area_ID could still keep under mass limit.
