    "preamble": "Given a 2D truss with specified nodal supports and a large force at node_3, previous designs fail to meet the unconservative stress-to-weight constraint (≤0.75) despite moderate total mass (<30). The objective is to create a minimal-mass, strongly triangulated, closed truss spanning three support nodes, robustly resisting heavy off-diagonal loads to keep stresses uniformly low relative to structure weight.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs verify truss must anchor between node_1 (pinned), node_2 & node_3 (rollers), survive a (-15, -30) force at node_3. Earlier trials show high local stress and poor weight efficiency due to flat, non-triangulated members that leave long spans on few members.",
    
    "analysis": "Node_3 takes a major vertical and horizontal force but does not act as a stable bridge apex; previous trusses use too many long horizontals and insufficient triangulated heights. Long horizontal/vertical members concentrating the bulk of the load (seen in stress data: member_1 with -54.77 on only 0.39 mass) blow up local stress numbers, generating excessive stress-to-weight ratio and most constraint violations. Historic nodes all cluster near a flat base line or, when raised (e.g., 'node_4', 'node_5'), they form very wide, shallow spans that don't reduce member force magnitudes enough. Stress-to-weight ratios always come out >1.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Common patterns in all failures: (1) Unbalanced load at node_3 not shared well with upper chords; (2) Few short, diagonally braced members at/around the loaded node; (3) Nodes tend to group into almost linear or shallow trapezoidal frames; (4) Sparse use of strong area_ids but balance needed (single area_one high stressed bars insufficient, distributed diagonals would drop peak force per member).",
    
    "proposal": "Redesign for strong triangulation around node_3, elevate two intermediate top nodes ('node_4' and new 'node_6') above the line from node_1 to node_2. Place a kite-shaped geometry so that each member is less than the total span, redistributing forces in multiple paths. Judging from earlier stress concentrations, keep each panel short (~2–3 m), brace above node_3 with upward node placements, enforce double-bracing from base to midspan. Use slightly thicker sections (area_id of '2'), choosing more members but of smaller capacity to distribute peak stress.",
    
    "reasoning": "Best-practice spatial truss (Pratt/Warren with quadrilateral panels around heavy load), each panel stabilized by short diagonals, minimizes max|stress|. Support conditions (node_1 pinned, node_2 and node_3 roller) are ideal for such a pattern: set two apexes above supports (node_4 at ~2.0, 3.0 and node_6 at ~4.0, 3.0); tie tops to bases to share external load at node_3 between several short diagonals. Forces thus distribute to four plus members near node_3, protecting all bars from excessive local compressions/tensions and sharply lowering stress/weight. Develop the lowest major spans next to supports with moderate area (around '2'), but let diagonals go to area_id '1'. Eliminate unnecessary lower chords.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume: (1) External force at node_3 decomposes among top bracing (from node_3 up to node_4, node_6), efficiently transferred to supports; ▪ Equilibrium: ΣFx = ΣFy = 0 across structure; (2) Use Warren/Pratt truss pattern for four-sided main panels, no unbraced small spans; Members: [node_1, node_3], [node_3, node_2], [node_1, node_4], [node_4, node_3], [node_4, node_6], [node_6, node_2], [node_3, node_6], [node_1, node_6]. Try area id ‘2’ for main chord/diagonal; total bar length estimated (max fantasy 18–20 m, lower mass), so we remain well under 30 mass cap with moderate sizing.",
    
    "calculation": "Estimate member length:\n- node_1 to node_3 = 2m\n- node_3 to node_2 = 4m\n- node_1 to node_4: sqrt((2-0)^2 + (3.0-0)^2) = 3.61\n- node_4 to node_3: sqrt((2-2)^2 + (3.0-0)^2) = 3.0\n- node_3 to node_6: sqrt((4-2)^2 + (3.0-0)^2) = 3.61\n- node_6 to node_2: sqrt((6-4)^2 + (3.0-0)^2) = 3.61\n- node_4 to node_6: (4-2=2); y=3->3: 2m\n- node_1 to node_6: sqrt((4-0)^2 + (3-0)^2) = 5.0\nPareto sum of member length: 26.83 m\nSelect area_id ‘2’ (A=0.782), total mass ~21\nEstimated midmember stresses (distribution now over 8+ bars instead of 1–2 so max|force| drop below 16), stress to weight: likely ≪0.75 (all load paths short), well under constraint limits.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "Review: No straight long base chords, combine kite/trapeze with Warren-bracing. All bars on area '2'; probable total mass of ~21 (well below 30); peak force/support load is around 16, and thus maximal stress for ~0.75 * 21 ≈ 16 (just at or comfortably below absolute limit, likely with extra margin over the more path-distributed topology). All loads/supports as per constraints. Node placements do not violate any port location constraint, and the structure is closed and structurally efficient.",
