The objective is to create a minimal-mass, strongly triangulated, closed truss spanning three support nodes, robustly resisting heavy off-diagonal loads to keep stresses uniformly low relative to structure weight.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs verify truss must anchor between node_1 (pinned), node_2 & node_3 (rollers), survive a (-15, -30) force at node_3. Earlier trials show high local stress and poor weight efficiency due to flat, non-triangulated members that leave long spans on few members.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Node_3 takes a major vertical and horizontal force but does not act as a stable bridge apex; previous trusses use too many long horizontals and insufficient triangulated heights. Long horizontal/vertical members concentrating the bulk of the load (seen in stress data: member_1 with -54.77 on only 0.39 mass) blow up local stress numbers, generating excessive stress-to-weight ratio and most constraint violations. Historic nodes all cluster near a flat base line or, when raised (e.g., \'node_4\', \'node_5\'), they form very wide, shallow spans that don\'t reduce member force magnitudes enough. Stress-to-weight ratios always come out >1.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Common patterns in all failures: (1) Unbalanced load at node_3 not shared well with upper chords; (2) Few short, diagonally braced members at/around the loaded node; (3) Nodes tend to group into almost linear or shallow trapezoidal frames; (4) Sparse use of strong area_ids but balance needed (single area_one high stressed bars insufficient, distributed diagonals would drop peak force per member).",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign for strong triangulation around node_3, elevate two intermediate top nodes (\'node_4\' and new \'node_6\') above the line from node_1 to node_2. Place a kite-shaped geometry so that each member is less than the total span, redistributing forces in multiple paths. Judging from earlier stress concentrations, keep each panel short (~2–3 m), brace above node_3 with upward node placements, enforce double-bracing from base to midspan. Use slightly thicker sections (area_id of \'2\'), choosing more members but of smaller capacity to distribute peak stress.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Best-practice spatial truss (Pratt/Warren with quadrilateral panels around heavy load), each panel stabilized by short diagonals, minimizes max|stress|. Support conditions (node_1 pinned, node_2 and node_3 roller) are ideal for such a pattern: set two apexes above supports (node_4 at ~2.0, 3.0 and node_6 at ~4.0, 3.0); tie tops to bases to share external load at node_3 between several short diagonals. Forces thus distribute to four plus members near node_3, protecting all bars from excessive local compressions/tensions and sharply lowering stress/weight. Develop the lowest major spans next to supports with moderate area (around \'2\'), but let diagonals go to area_id \'1\'. Eliminate unnecessary lower chords.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume: (1) External force at node_3 decomposes among top bracing (from node_3 up to node_4, node_6), efficiently transferred to supports; ▪ Equilibrium: ΣFx = ΣFy = 0 across structure; (2) Use Warren/Pratt truss pattern for four-sided main panels, no unbraced small spans; Members: [node_1, node_3], [node_3, node_2], [node_1, node_4], [node_4, node_3], [node_4, node_6], [node_6, node_2], [node_3, node_6], [node_1, node_6].
