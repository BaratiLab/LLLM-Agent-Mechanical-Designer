    "preamble": "This single-shot task aims to design a fully-connected, closed 2D truss with three colinear base nodes ({'node_1': (0.0,0.0), 'node_2': (6.0,0.0), 'node_3': (2.0,0.0)}), under oblique load at node_3 and specific supports. The objective is to minimize the maximum member stress-to-weight ratio, not exceeding 0.75, and maintain truss mass ≤ 30, by optimizing both topology (member arrangement and triangulation) and discrete cross-sectional areas.",

    "scratch_pad_1": "The three initial nodes are colinear, which alone precludes triangulated closure—a necessity for stability under non-parallel loading. At least one extra node, positioned off the x-axis to facilitate triangulation (likely above node_3), must be added. Given strong downward-and-left loading on node_3 and support on all three bases, triangulation should direct loads to efficiently exploit roller/pinned supports.",

    "analysis": "Colinear supports are unstable for out-of-plane forces unless braced. Since node_3 has both horz. and vert. load components, a vertical/off-axis fourth node (call it node_4, tentatively at (2.0,2.2)) above node_3 can anchor an efficient triangle with all base nodes. Rollers at node_2 and node_3 direct vertical reactions, so most horizontal force must relay through node_1. Loads best dissipate through direct connections and triangular bracing involving the new node.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation is structurally mandatory; adding 'node_4' will allow splitting of load path and provide much better stress distribution. Members will connect: node_1↔node_2, node_2↔node_3, node_1↔node_3, plus all three to node_4. The member directly from node_3 to node_4 will bear most load, so needs high area. Minimize weight by selecting area_{1-4} for less loaded chords. Check total member forces using statics and rough stiffness requirements.",

    "reasoning": "Diagram symmetry and focus in load path suggests node_4 placed vertically over node_3, so force diagonals have short lengths for effectiveness, minimizing overall mass. Connect all truss nodes directly to node_4 to form at least two triangles each side of node_3. Nodally, edge members use minimal interactive length to reduce mass with smallest workable area, and diagonals are sized for the highest stress but using lowest permitted area to reduce weight/mass ratio.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: all member material same, cross-sectional area according to area_id table; truss is pin-jointed (axial only); analyze statically (loads resolved at joints). Steps: 1) Place 'node_4' above 'node_3' with optimal y=>2.20 so main diagonals about 2.20m long. 2) Members are: node_1-2, node_1-3, node_2-3 (base), plus node_1-4, node_2-4, node_3-4. 3) Compute member lengths, force proportion in main diagonals (estimate ≈ load/\u221Al^2; use geometric projection); size required areas. 4) Sum (length×area) for all, get mass; evaluate each (stress/weight) <0.75. Use area_id:'5' (A=4.887) for two main diagonals, '2'(A=0.782) for vertical, and '1'(A=0.195) for base chords.",

    "calculation": "Member lengths:  node_1-2=6.00m; node_2-3=4.00m; node_1-3=2.00m; node_3-4=2.20m; (node_4 @ (2.0,2.2)). node_1-4=sqrt((2-0)^2+2.2^2)=√8.84=2.98m; node_2-4=√[(6-2)^2 + (0-2.2)^2]=√[(16)+(4.84)]=4.38m. Assigning areas: main diagonals (node_3-4, node_1-4, node_2-4): '5'(4.887), '2'(0.782) for verical/short chords, '1'(0.195) for base. Weight ≈ sum(length×area): base:6.0×0.195+4×0.195+2×0.195=2.34+0.78+0.39=3.51; diagonals:2.2×4.887+2.98×4.887+4.38×0.782=10.75+14.55+3.43=28.73. Total ≈3.51+28.73=32.24. Exceeds mass limit. Reduce main diagonals to '4'(3.128): 2.2×3.128+2.98×3.128+4.38×0.782=6.88+9.32+3.43=19.63. Now total mass≈3.51+19.63=23.14 (acceptable). Estimate max force in node_3-4 member ≈ |load|/sin(theta), where theta=90°, so straight up; so max stress=force/area. Use area=3.128. Max stress = √((-15)^2+(-30)^2)/3.128=33.54/3.128=10.73. Stress-to-weight=10.73/23.14=0.46 (within limit).",

    "scratch_pad_final": "Design is triangulated with minimal added node and efficient bracing, mass below 30, and stress-to-weight ratio below 0.75. All members connect unique nodes and close fully. All supports satisfied, optimal area IDs chosen.",
