The current and past designs do not satisfy the stress-to-weight ratio constraint (must be ≤0.75) and maximum mass (≤30). Objective: Generate a closed, efficient structure that meets these constraints, optimizing node position and member selection.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes at supports and at load, and prior attempts fail due to high stress-to-weight ratios. New design must spread load efficiently, ensure all nodes involved, maintain closure and restrict mass without using excessive/oversized members.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current and historical attempts fail due to overly concentrated load paths, undersized areas for some heavily-stressed members, and overly horizontal/flat geometry. Maximum member stress often integrates high force magnification for long, under-braced members. Purely horizontal base members combine with high-point loads to induce large moments and big force oscillations in mid-span panels (as in classic under-braced or flat truss failure). Extra nodes just dispersed mass, not stress concentration. The \'kite\' or \'double triangle\' form common in historic optimums could work here but must keep short spans, use strong verticals at the loaded node, and area increase for stressed members, while strengthening or repositioning diagonals.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key patterns: flat or shallow triangles in prior designs focus moment and stress on center members. High vertical load at node_3 demands direct vertical and diagonally triangulated support for stress spread. Additional elevations or flares for the chords/diagonals needed. Dense mesh not needed, but strong direct vertical towards the loaded node and triangulation from the supports towards the upper node(s) will help spread force.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Propose to redesign with a double triangle (\'Pratt\'-type) with raised upper chord node above the loaded midspan node, closely triangulating the central loaded region between supports. All non-load/support nodes can be moved for force management. Add a new top node to the current set, slightly above node_4\'s historic position and recalculate base distance to spread the triangles, using two member sizes: thicker central vertical/diagonals, lighter side panels. Use truss closure by including base members. This shape will balance forces and dramatically lower peak member stress, reducing ratio and total mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Raising the location of the upper chord node(s) tightens triangles above the base, promotes balanced force transfer and shortens over-stressed spans. Closing the truss with base and diagonals ensures statical determinacy and redundancy. Strong vertical/diagonals on the loaded region support high vertical force with minimum horizontal amplification. Adequately size these with area_id \'4\', distribute remaining members (chords and side ties) with lighter area_id \'2\'. Members are arranged to force/direct force paths efficiently and minimize bending, ensure closure of the geometry, and use minimal material. Will also precisely position top node using force equilibrium for vertical component.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Add node_5 directly above node_3 to take load in pure compression or tension. Members: node_1↔node_2(base), node_1↔node_3, node_3↔node_2 (lower chords); node_1↔node_5, node_2↔node_5 (upper chords); node_3↔node_5 (vertical); close truss with diagonals node_1↔node_2, node_1↔node_4, node_2↔node_4, node_3↔node_4. Bases at (0,0) and (6,0), node_3 stays at 2,0 because roller+load. Place node_5 at (3,3.3) calculated so sum vertical member lengths balances input load angles.

Using two top nodes above node_3, truss height h=3.3. Estimated largest member force at or below F=N_top*sec(θ5) < 12kN given triangle height/spread. Member stress: max estimated at ~10kN/3.128 (A_id=4) = 3.2 (well within usually expected steel MEA), mass = sum(length*area). Total length: 3 for base, sides about 3.6, vertical 3.3, top chords ~3.6, diagonals ~4.2; so total length <22, mass (using area) ≈22*3.128/4 ≈ 17. (well below 30 kg).
