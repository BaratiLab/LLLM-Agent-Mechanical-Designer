The constraint is to minimize the global stress-to-weight ratio—with current best at 0.4771—while retaining a total mass below 30 units, and all original supports, loaded nodes, and stability. Geometry (location of pinned/roller, horizontal loaded nodes) and generation history suggest prioritizing triangle-based top chords and a straight, efficient lower chord.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The goals are: minimize max(abs(stress))/total_mass (≤ 0.75), total_mass ≤ 30. Most current/historic designs satisfy these. Node locations for supports/loads are fixed ([0.0,0.0], [6.0,0.0], [2.0,0.0]), only the top node is variable, currently placed at ~[3.2,3.1] or best ~[3.0,3.3]. Member areas are mostly moderate (area \'2\'-\'4\' on diagonals. Historic proposals with more members (\'10\' vs. \'6\') reduced stress ratio, but with mass-constraint violations.",\n\n    "analysis": "Load path: All vertical/external load is at node_3 ([2.0,0.0]) as -15.0N, -30.0N. Always: node_1 (pinned) is structural anchor; node_2, node_3 (rollers), restrict movement only. Current (2. best) design uses a height-variant top node at (3.2,3.1) (slightly lower and right vs. historic best (3.0,3.3)), resulting in less than optimal truss height → modest mass, but slightly higher stress-to-mass value (0.5841) compared to the best history (0.4771 at (3.0,3.3)). Historic best thus trades a small stress increase (12.95 vs. 12.84) for larger mass (27.15 vs. 21.98), lowering stress/weight more efficiently, and retains constraint satisfaction. Designs adding interior nodes/members fail mass constraints (e.g. mass=40, constraint_not_met_1; adding extra interior triangles improved load-spread, but was too heavy). Designs with flatter top node perform worse on stress due to less triangulation and steeper, unbraced diagonal load paths.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The higher position of node_5 (up to 3.3, at [3.0,3.3]) clearly results in superior stress/weight, even when a single critical diagonal ([\'node_3\',\'node_5\']) is thickened (area \'4\'). Other attempts to improve by extra node(s) failed mass constraints. Therefore, the lower, right-shifted node_5 (current) is not justified: despite mass savings, it does not proportionally drop the stress/to-weight ratio. Historic best also \'wastes\' some member capacity but allows a fatter, more efficient (lower effective length) diagonal to control maximum stress, at acceptable marginal mass.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Switch to the historic best configuration: node_5 at precise [3.0, 3.3], top of arch, maintaining symmetry. Member areas as in that configuration, with increased area (\'4\', 3.128) in the highly-stressed diagonal [\'node_3\', \'node_5\'], and all other vital braces as area \'2\'. No nodes or supports change. Attempting further reduction of mass by lowering node_5 only increases stress, worsening the ratio. Adding new triangles/members violates the mass constraint (see attempted 5-node history). Therefore, propose reverting to or very slightly tweaking the historic best (potentially fine-tuning area of mid-diagonal), but as historic best satisfies all constraints and achieves superior minimum, accept it as optimum.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Zig-zagging central bracing and maximizing truss height/symmetry yields the lowest critical member force per unit mass, as with classic Pratt-truss or triangular-high struts for simply supported beams. Put node_5 highest centrally (3.0, 3.3). No other placement below or above historic best meets both key constraints and further optimizing triangulation/top-node height is moot as moving node_5 lower/shallower increases stress rapidly (mass drops but ratio increases, as shown geometrically and confirmed historically). Thickening the main web/diagonal at node_3 → node_5 (\\u20184\') splits critical force over highest -- optimal. Thicker web members beyond this do not increase efficiency due to diminishing returns within mass constraint. All diagonals use minimum possible area for stability and overall mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All member lengths easily calcuable via Pythagoras. Area assignments based on expected force (e.g., use \'4\' for [\'node_3\',\'node_5\'] = zone with highest negative force), others area \'2\'. Effective member stress = force/(area), summed mass uses area-to-mass mapping given. Max-stress nodes are brace (\'node_1\',\'node_3\', \'2\') and [\'node_3\',\'node_5\',\'4\']. Proposed queen-post triangles reduce critical stress/weight promisingly; keeping configuration at or above previous historic best also makes overall assembly a single rigid block.",\n    \n    "calculation": "For (node positions):\\n- node_1: (0.0, 0.0)\\n- node_2: (6.0, 0.0)\\n- node_3: (2.0, 0.0)\\n- node_5: (3.0, 3.3)\\nMembers:\\n- Calculate length, assign area id (\'2\': 0.782, \'4\': 3.128).\\nMembers: {\'member_1\': [node_1, node_3, \'2\'], member_2: [node_3, node_2, \'2\'], m_3: [node_1,node_5,\'2\'], m_4: [node_5,node_2,\'2\'], m_5:[node_3,node_5,\'4\'], m_6:[node_1,node_2,\'2\']}.
