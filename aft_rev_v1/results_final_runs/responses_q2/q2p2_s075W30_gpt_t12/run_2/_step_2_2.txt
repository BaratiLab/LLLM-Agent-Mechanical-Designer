    "preamble": "Given a 2D truss with three supports, one free node, and a large external load, the prevailing structures in history fail stress-to-weight and mass constraints. Optimization seeks a closed, triangulated solution that keeps max(stress/weight) ≤ 0.75 and total mass ≤ 30, while keeping all supported and loaded nodes unchanged.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives: (1) Reduce peak stress or lengthen overloaded members so stress is distributed, (2) Lower mass or stay well below 30. Supports/load nodes fixed per instructions, ensure all paths between supports and load are stable and triangulated. Node_3 location is crucial due to direct applied load.",
    
    "analysis": "Current/historic structures are variations on a trapezoidal/truss arch (nodes 1,2,3 in a base line; node 4 above on the web), ensured by adding diagonals and chords. Highest absolute stress seen on a short, light member (node_1–node_3). This generates excessive max_stress/weight (3.23 ≫ 0.75). Both load transfer and mass storage are inefficient: diagonal/web members likely undersized, lower chord relatively direct, but heavy web diagonals (node_3–node_4) are both long and stressed, adding mass rather than capacity. The history shows cut-down/reduced trusses are even less optimal (mass goes down but stress/weight shoots up). Structure is not sufficiently triangulated to distribute load directly to supports.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Most stress accumulates in node_1–3 (load chord tied to support pin). The two-triangle geometry cannot share the heavy downward and oblique loading at node_3. This node is also unsupported vertically so experiences severe moments. Increasing triangulation and providing a direct path from node_3 up to node_2, and connecting diagonally towards node_4 (web) can share and indirectly transfer load. Redistribute vertical load, minimize length/mass for diagonals. Area IDs can be traded: expand cross-section in most loaded members.",
    
    "proposal": "Redesign: Retain pinned, roller, loaded nodes to comply with instructions. Move node_4 upward and slightly inward for better triangle shape, minimizing diagonal length but maximizing load triangle's efficiency. Add another node (node_5) above midpoint of base (between node_1, node_2), improve arch behavior by enabling load sharing, and fully triangulate region beneath node_3 to distribute force. Tune member cross-sections: heavier where required for load, lighter elsewhere.",
    
    "reasoning": "Triangulated truss reduces max force per member and stabilizes under all loads. Symmetric (w/~4+5 major triangles) solution takes advantage of leverage and direct paths for force transfer. The new node_5 at (x=3.5, y=3.3) establishes more optimal angles for arching/top chords. Diagonals route load to both supports, minimizing bending in horiz. chords. Increased area near high-stress path (node_3–node_1/2, node_3–node_5). All triangles close, no unbraced node.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All bar elements, axial action only. Each triangle shares at least one edge over the central loaded node or members bear force along those most parallel to applied load. Use area_id='2' (0.782) standard, scaling to '3' (1.759) for chord diagonals, and only use '1' (0.195) for lightest/least loaded. Steps: (1) Write out all relevant members for fully triangulated structure. (2) Assign area_ids for high-stress vs light paths, keeping overall mass under 30. Calculate: member lengths, estimate load sharing (stress = applied force * unit vector dot member direction / area), total weight = sum(len*area). Ensure max stress/total_weight ≤ 0.75 typically by reducing chord stresses and introducing greater path sharing. Diagonal ties for anti-sway redundant paths.",
    
    "calculation": "Adding node_5 at (3.5, 3.3): members—node_3–node_5, node_1–node_5, node_2–node_5, node_4–node_5, base member node_1–node_2, node_1–node_4, node_4–node_2, node_1–node_3, node_2–node_3, node_3–node_4. Key diagonals: node_1–node_4, node_2–node_4, node_3–node_5, node_5–node_1, node_5–node_2. Approximate member lengths (~0.1 precision): node_1–node_5 = sqrt(3.5^2+3.3^2)=4.81, node_2–node_5=sqrt(2.5^2+3.3^2)=4.15, node_4–node_5=sqrt((0.5)^2+(1.1)^2)=1.21, etc. Anticipate largest forces along node_3–node_5, node_5–node_1/2. Assign area_id: '3' (1.759) for node_3–node_5, node_1–node_5, node_2–node_5, '2' (0.782) other critical truss chords, '1' (0.195) for web-criss crossing of node_4, node_5.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Main triangles: [(node_1, node_3, node_5), (node_2, node_3, node_5), (node_1, node_2, node_5), (node_4, node_5, node_3)]. All nodes except supports/load are free to move; lock supports/load as per above constraints. Triangulation dramatically reduces load on a single chord and enables smaller section usage. Double-check: Will avoid isolating any node, ensure direct web members present.",
