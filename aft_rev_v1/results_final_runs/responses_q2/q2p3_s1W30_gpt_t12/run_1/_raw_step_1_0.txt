The current structure is feasible and serves as both baseline and highest scoring in the history (stress-to-weight ratio = 0.2914, total mass = 21.108, complies with all constraints). Objective: further reduce the stress-to-weight ratio while meeting given constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given max(abs(stress))/total_weight is well below 1.0 and mass (21.108 < 30). All required nodes (support and loaded) are co-linear on the x-axis, with the loaded node (\'node_3\') at (2.0, 0.0). Initial structure forms a triangle (members connecting all 3 nodes), but \'node_3\' is in line with \'node_1\' and \'node_2\', leading to inefficient force distribution and concentration of stress in member_2.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Currently, the load at \'node_3\' (2.0, 0.0) causes a much higher compressive member force in \'member_2\' due to poor geometry (degenerate triangle: nodes are aligned). Most efficient trusses typically exploit vertical offset (raising \'node_3\') providing triangulation, improving force sharing and reducing peak stress. However, direct y-coordinate modification for \'node_3\' is not possible because it holds a roller support and the load. Total mass and area assignments (to area_id \'3\') are reasonable but possibly larger than necessary. Thus, geometry, not sizing, is the limiting factor.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing structural depth (vertical offset) is a classic way to drop stress, but constrained here. Next best: Rethink how much each member participates by carefully routing and sizing, or, if permissible, adding one node above or below span for truss action (\'Warren\' or \'Pratt\' variant), still keeping closed, minimal node count and minimal extra mass influencing total weight more than stress drop.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Introduce an articulation by adding a single new upper node, called \'node_4\', connected to all original nodes (\'1\', \'2\', \'3\'). In effect, transform degenerate triangle into fully triangulated truss (now with 4 nodes, 5 or 6 members, polygon and 2 diagonals). This distributes load more efficiently, especially aiding the overstressed member_2. Assign the existing minimal area_id to new diagonals if forced. Place \'node_4\' equidistant above existing node_3 along y, minimizing vertical height added (to limit mass) but providing the largest stress drop. Connect members: (1,4); (2,4); (3,4); plus preserve both original spans (1-3), (3-2), (2-1). Validate all members close the truss circuit.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Insert \'node_4\' vertically above node_3 (x=2.0, y determined to balance weight and stress, let\'s choose y=1.50 as a low but sufficient triangulation for example). Repeat member area selection for primary triangle at area_id=\'3\', assign diagonals at area_id=\'1\'. Each extra member slightly increases mass, but should dramatically lower stress in original overloaded diagonal, dropping stress-to-weight and enabling slimmer sizing in next iterations if desired. Placement is symmetrical, force transfers are improved, all constraints met with improved performance.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All members use steel-like density (shoulder mass estimation). Area choice to logics: heavy-load members stay at area_id=\'3\'; new diagonals set at area_id=\'1\' (lower). Will add five or six total members (fully triangulated quadrilateral: (1-2), (2-3), (3-1), (1-4), (2-4), (3-4)). Each length calculated by distance. Mass by length × area for each area_id. Stress distribution improved by statics, concentrated now on short diagonals.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Coordinates: node_1=(0,0), node_2=(6,0), node_3=(2,0), node_4=(2,1.50).
