The objective is to minimize the structure’s maximum member stress-to-total-weight ratio (<=1.0) and total mass (<=30 units), while ensuring nodes are closed (fully connected), supports accurate, and using only discrete available section areas.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "With three ground nodes forming a base (two on x-axis marks separated widely, third at 1/3 interval), and a moderate span, the dominant loading is applied obliquely at node_3. Angled loads and nearly collinear base nodes mean the structure must resolve strong shear/tension and avoid sway. Direct line connections (“triangle” solutions) will be most efficient—triangulation is mandatory by instructions.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The loads at node_3 require effective pathing to both pinned (node_1) and roller (node_2) supports. A direct link (bottom chord) between node_1 and node_2 resists horizontal thrust, a link from node_3 to each support resolves vertical and some moments. However, the almost collinear arrangement risks large bending and inefficient member forces—adding a fourth (apex/triangulation) node much above the base can split the spans and halve stresses. The member sizes must be carefully picked given the aggressive stress/mass constraint.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulating, ideally via an elevated node above the load to create compact triangles with short struts and split forces, ensures both load-path efficiency and a low stress-to-weight ratio. Direct links from the elevated apex to all three base nodes further create two strong triangles. Roadblocks: choosing apex height and keeping node coordinates constructible. Must keep total member length (hence mass) in-mind, as a taller apex increases mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "To minimize extreme member stress and mass, a symmetric truss featuring: node_1—node_2 (base chord), node_3—node_1 and node_3—node_2 (diagonals), with a new node_4 roughly above the base center forming a triangle atop the structure, is called for. Height is set such that triangles are neither too tall (increases mass) nor too flat (inefficient, high force). The load at node_3 will flow upward on one leg and downward on the other, both delivered to their supports via short, efficient triangulated members.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Key equations: Force at node_3 = (-15, -30) N. Member directions and geometries: base (node_1—node_2) is 6.00 units.
