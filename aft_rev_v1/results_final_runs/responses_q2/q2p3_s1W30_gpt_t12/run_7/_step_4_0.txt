    "preamble": "The goal is to produce the most efficient closed 2D truss from five given nodes and connectivity, with nodes 1, 2, and 3 as supports/load application. The optimization target is to minimize the structure's maximum stress-to-weight ratio, currently at 0.3147 (with a mass of 22.24), while maintaining constraint compliance: (1) stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 1.0, (2) total mass ≤ 30, and (3) all connectivity/closure/supports/load conditions, using only prespecified sectional area indices.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Current best structure (iteration 3/25) is already within all constraints, ranking 0.3147 (significantly ahead of the rest); node locations put upper chords slightly arched, and cross-members triangulate from node_3 for good load-transfer. Largest stress is quite evenly distributed, few members highly utilized, but total structure mass is relatively high. Generation history reveals attempts to reduce mass led to unacceptably high stress utilization or constraint violations.",
    
    "analysis": "Supports and the major load (node_3: -15, -30) are co-located near mid-span, with node_1 (0,0) and node_2 (6,0) as boundary supports. The top chord is gently sloped–nodes_4 (1.85,2.7) and _5 (4.2,2.2)–with practical connectivity forming a tight, triangulated web between lower nodes, mid-span, and the arching upper chord. Effective force paths, visualizing load transfer from loaded node_3 to both supports and through upper nodal points, suggest efficient stress diffusion; currently, the most stressed member is compressive (likely lower chord near node_3) at -7.0, far from constraint limit, revealing that there might be modest scope to reduce over-conservatisms. Member areas reflect prescriptive assignment nearly optimal for constraint satisfaction.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Moves to reduce mass further (from historic low of ~15.2) reliably produce stress overruns or constraint noncompliance. The evenness of member stress shows good force diffusion but deep upper points (node_4 @ 2.7) may cause unnecessarily long top members, marginally overweight for force path requirements. Areas 1/2 match force paths well given calculated stresses (~±7 in heavy-compression/tension ones). Geometry is relatively optimal triangulation, but could be further trimmed by fine-tuning vertical node heights for shorter compressive/tensile sub-chords and slightly more direct force transfer, without undermining closure.",
    
    "proposal": "Retain present nodal configuration but explore a minor refinement: reduce the vertical height of node_4 slightly and bring node_5 closer to center, tightening force path without reducing chord length so much as to spike stresses. Members will remain nearly identical in connectivity and area selection, but expect some modest mass and stress optimization from node rebalancing without constraint risk.",
    
    "reasoning": "Triangulated trusses are most efficient in distributing loads. For robustness, top chord rise can be controlled while maintaining closure and a single stable web (every node used, no isolation). Reducing height of node_4 and nudging node_5 medially causes no support or load position changes (all with fixed DOF), and enables modest reductions in select member length, best for reducing unnecessary web material use. Members that bear the greatest stress (chord between node_1 and _3) retain largest areas. Removing/changing members risks constraint violation as historic designs have proven. The area assignments should undergo only fine-tuned adjustment.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Node adjustments: node_4 y reduced from 2.7 to ~2.40; node_5 (was [4.2,2.2]), move to 3.8, 2.0, shortening chord without being co-linear. Members reassign as in optimal–no removal, preserving closure/robustness. Mass recalculated as sum(L * area), majority unchanged; slight length decrease in upper top web, expect ~4-8% total mass lessen. Anticipated max stress remains on member_1, slightly increased due to shorter leverage arm (<7.5), so still well under constraint. Keep member areas as in current best structure, or reduce individual web member areas if member stresses notably decreased. All members' area_id in {'1', '2', '3'} as before.",
    
    "calculation": "Member lengths for top chord and diagonals: e.g., node_4 (1.85,2.40)–about 2.87 m from node_1. Diagonal length checks yield smaller values, marginally less mass per member for those involved. Recalculate mass: significant members reduced in length by 5–15%, total structural mass estimated to drop by ~1.3 kg (previously 22.24 now ~20.90 full sum by prescribed area). Assume stress increases from leverage while load transfer efficiencies rise; overall max(abs(stress)) grows from ~7.0 to 7.8, so stress-to-weight ratio expects 0.37 (7.8/20.9), close but not exceeding best previous. Perturb further: restore top point slightly (say y=2.50) and right, until novel mass/ratio is tested against base. If minimum improvement, return base optimal.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "All node movements and member assignments checked: supports/load nodes *unchanged*, internal upper points gently lowered, bringing total member count/area set in closer alignment with most effective use. Area assignments preserved from optimal checkpoint for guaranteed pass. Test: max stress modestly higher (project to 7.31), mass lower (~21), ratio circa 0.348, rivaling best found. As reduction isn't substantial and stress rise occurs, base design is functionally optimal. No net benefit; therefore ready to recommend freeze and stop.",
    
    "stop": "True", # All feasible means of further improvement within design/ranking/constraint set highly unlikely to yield meaningful betterment within topology/fixed nodes. Geometry and areas already ideal for constraint margin.
