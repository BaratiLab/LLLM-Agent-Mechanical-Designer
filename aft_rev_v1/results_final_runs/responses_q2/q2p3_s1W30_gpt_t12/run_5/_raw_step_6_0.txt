Past iterations either violated the main stress-to-weight constraint while attaining low mass, or attained poor mass efficiency at low ratios. The current design is under-strength. Objective: minimally connect all non-removable support/load nodes with new optimal geometry and minimum necessary area sizing to fully satisfy constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Parsing objectives: Loads and fixed supports cannot move or be removed. Key challenge is lowering the stress-to-weight ratio below 1.0, attained recently at values of 1.1+. Exploring geometry/sizing to reduce beam forces or use slightly more (but still low-mass) material, aiming nickel-mass but higher safety.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current and similar past designs use a vertically tall triangle with node_4 above the span, with minor variations. These had stress-to-weight ratios >1.0 due to member_1 (node_1 to node_3) being highly loaded in compression/tension; triangular geometry improves load path but concentrates force. The two-hinged pin/roller base results in horizontal forces pushed onto slender members: making triangles larger/narrower increases force in base chord. In the history, lower stress-to-weight ratios (e.g. 0.66) only resulted in extra heavy structures, so maximizing area sizing everywhere excessively wastes mass. Critical members (e.g. base chord and diagonals) need largest allowed area within efficient geometry. A new approach is to both upsize these while using minimally sufficient areas elsewhere and improve triangulation in load region.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Consistent problem: member_1 takes critical force, steep triangle amplifies axial forces in chord, mass is used inefficiently. Increasing node_4\'s y improves triangulation but hurts mass—there is a trade-off point. Introducing a second top node (pentagon/warren), with additional diagonal ties, will distribute the force and yield more modest member forces while keeping mass down if using smart sizing. Keeping all loads/supported points fixed (rule), I\'ll add an extra node between them for a better geometry: split the single high apex into two, reduce the vertical extent sufficiently for triangulation to work but keep efficient.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Enhance symmetry and triangulation in upper sections with a compact fink-type truss (a lightweight double-top node). Add a new node_5: above/between node_2 and node_3. Connect node_4 and node_5 to devise two braced top triangles. Material is allocated efficiently: slight upsizing (to area_id=\'2\' or \'3\') for the base and diagonal members that attract the biggest force (by geometry), minimal sizing (\'1\' or \'0\') for upright/verticals and rare low-force webs.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Statics: Spreading the long diagonal force from node_3 with twin-top geometry reduces the force on the base chord (node_1–node_2), spreading the load by two load paths. Mixing area upsizing and tight geometry for main chords with minimal web/mass elsewhere lowers total stress and attains constraint. Expected force distribution becomes less concentrated and critical sections less highly loaded, especially for member_1 at node_3. By preventing excessive increases in vertical/tower height we avoid mass penalty, but an extra web distributes compressive/tension loads more efficiently overall. Pinning the geometry precisely, use small offsets where justified and no snapping.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Set node_4 near the original triangle, ~[1.2, 6.0], and place new node_5 at [4.2, 5.0] (above and right of node_3, but not too high for mass).

Highest force (history: ~15.4kN) yields stress: σ = F/A, critical areas now at 0.782 so σ=15/0.782=19.2, but since load distribution is now shared/quieter per bar (est. max_bar_force=12, base_up), yields stress-to-weight ratio ≈ 12/17.32=0.69 <1.0.
