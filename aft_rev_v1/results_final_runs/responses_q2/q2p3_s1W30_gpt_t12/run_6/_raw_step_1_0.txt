The stress-to-weight ratio exceeds 1.0, violating the primary constraint. Objective: create a closed, minimal mass truss with (max_stress/total_mass) <= 1.0 and total mass <= 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs show stress-to-weight ratio = 2.3113 (constraint violated); mass = 16.2638 (constraint ok). Stress on member_5 (-37.59) greatly exceeds that of others—implies poor force distribution. All nodes with loads/supports must remain unchanged by constraints.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current geometry forms an open truss with under-triangulation in key spans. The highest stress is localized in member_5 (connecting node_1 to node_3), indicating this link is bearing the brunt of the horizontal-shear induced by off-axis loading at node_3. Nodes are in a straight line with node_4 above; insufficient triangulation leads to direct-failure and improper load sharing. Notably, node_3 is both a roller support and loaded point; it qualifies as the most sensitive design axis. The structure is closed, but some areas lack efficient bracing—the distributed load is uneven and ineffective.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Improved structure should add triangulation, especially to share load at node_3 across more triangles. The top node (above node_3)—node_4—can be shifted, or additional top node can be introduced to let node_3 become part of at least two triangles. Use only area_id: \'1\', \'2\', possibly \'3\' to minimize mass while controlling stress. Lower-stress members (e.g., node_1-node_2) can stay at minimal area; high-stress (node_1-node_3) must use the largest area possible to avoid exceeding the constraint. Keep supports and loads fixed by constraints.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the structure as a statically determinate, fully triangulated Pratt/Warren truss: introduce one additional node above node_3 (node_5 at (2.75, 1.5)) to form two upper triangles, improving load path sharing and reducing max member force. Adjust existing node_4 to align along an effective load distribution (e.g., shift node_4 to (4.0, 1.6)). This sidesteps member_5 as the only strong load path. Use area assignments accordingly: max area (3) for primary load members, medium (2) for diagonals, min (1/0) for supporting, uncritical lower chords.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Classic truss strategies (Pratt/Warren configuration) achieve minimum peak forces (stress) for a given mass: triangles distribute forces most efficiently and improve load paths. By positioning node_5 above midspan (node_3) and connecting it to node_1, node_2, and node_3, both horizontal and vertical shear at node_3 are properly distributed. High-force members (near loaded node) are assigned larger areas (e.g., \'3\'); supporting members further from load use limited area to minimize total mass",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_1 to node_3 (2 units, base chord); node_2 to node_3 (4 units, base chord). Top chords (1 to 5, 2 to 5, 3 to 5) make triangle. Sizing: assign \'3\' to main strut (node_1-node_3 and node_2-node_3), \'2\' to diagonals to/above node_5, \'1\' to horizontal base members, possibly 0 for node_1-node_2 if only lightly loaded. Quick estimate: diagonal ~√((2.75-2)^2 + 1.5^2) ≈ 1.7. Chord ~1.7. Mass total for conservative estimate with 3 @ 1.759×2, 2 @ 0.782×2; stay under 30.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Preliminary static analysis: shift at node_5 distributes half the load induced at node_3 along the top node (reduces single-max force by about 40%). Horizontal members stay low-stress with modest compression/tension; diagonals even out forces. Assigning biggest section to node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2 (primary loaded web), diagonals/webs with \'2\', horizontals at \'1\' keeps mass ~12–14. All max local forces estimated under 12–14, so for max_stress/mass < 1.0 (max stress < mass from area IDs). Estimate: max_stress ~12, mass ~15: 12/15 ≈ 0.80 < 1.0.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Nodes with supports/loads remain as prescribed. Added node_5 selected to maximize triangulation above node_3 and to regain symmetry and force sharing. Reassigned members to physically optimal trinagulation layout: links cover all triangle closure.
