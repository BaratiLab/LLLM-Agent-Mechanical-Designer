Triangulation through at least one elevated node is necessary. As node_3 is a roller with a vertical and horizontal pend - large deformations unless triangulation is deployed. Placing a new node above the x-axis breaks symmetry and enables direct, diagonal load path anchoring node_3.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Need at minimum 4 nodes to ensure a closed, robust triangle under arbitrary planar loads—suggest a new node_4 above the base. Optimal vertical position selected to balance member, reduce lever arm from node_3\'s force. Classic \'Warren truss\' layout would be cheapest for such a geometry. All connections must be single-link per node pair (no multitriang). Avoid long, skinny high-force members.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "One optimal topology is two triangles with shared base: Add node_4 between node_1, node_2, above ~midpoint (allows all current supports), join via five members (\'chord\', two rising/diagonal, one tie to node_3, and one to base for closure). Using shortest links and good symmetry reduces both weight and, crucially, peak stress in over-stretched members. Select smallest workable areas near high-stress nodes, upsize where direct force paths expected.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume modulus/safety ok for area_id picks, focus on constraints. Steps: (i) Estimate force flows given nodal locations and loads; (ii) Compute member directions, lengths; (iii) Allocate section from supplied areas to minimize stress/kernel ratio (while checking mass constraint). (iv) Nodes: preserve integer node numbers, compute new node_4 position—let\'s trial node_4=(3.0,1.8) (direct above node_3).
