All design decisions tightly follow minimization of the stress-to-weight ratio, global mass, and clarity of load paths through statically determinate triangulation.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs: Three main nodes nearly aligned horizontally, with node_3 intermediate. Loads acting at node_3 (downward left), node_1 is pinned, others as rollers. All must be structurally connected and augmented if optimality can be improved. Constraint targets are formidable: stress-to-weight <= 1.0 and mass <= 30 (via preselected, discrete cross sections).",\n\n    "analysis": "Direct condition: loads (-15, -30)N at node_3 demand both x and y control. node_1 pinned, so x/y restraint at one end, while node_2, node_3 permit translations constrained via roller conditions. With only one internal node and a triangular layout possible, but spread is wide horizontally; direct (node_1-node_2), diagonals (node_1-node_3) will carry bulk of forces. Adding an elevated node forming a vertical triangle, supporting node_3 vertically upward, redistributes loads more efficiently, reducing member weight and stress concentration. Structural indeterminacy is minimized but stability is maintained. Main failure risk: element overload under unsymmetric force at node_3.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation with a high node above node_3 will help achieve vertical and horizontal force component resolution. Positioning this node above node_3 (y > 0, x ~= node_3) sends force directly to supports via shortest high-angle members, moderating element axial stresses. Closed network and all connections remain practical as vertical and diagonal members are highly effective in such geometry. Area selections start with small (<0.782) values for secondary, with primary diagonals needing moderately larger sizes.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Introduce \'node_4\' at (2.0, 3.5) to create two triangles: (node_1-node_3-node_4), (node_2-node_3-node_4). This gives an efficient, lightweight, statically determinate planar system rather than a heavy single-span. It routes loads from node_3 more directly upwards and sideways to supports, so axial forces required are minimized for mass. All connections now must reference unique nodes. Select minimal viable area_ids commensurate with load magnitude and member force estimates.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: area list directly packs mass. Steel E and yield params not enforced, only stress-to-weight by definition. Cross-sectional area (A) from discrete IDs found from lengths: l(node_1-node_2)=6, l(node_1-node_3)=2, l(node_2-node_3)=4, diag(node_3-node_4)=3.5, etc. Force assignment: main diagonal carries \'vertical\' (load_y/2/sin(theta)), less for horizon joins. Optimize by equivalence: Try areas \'2\' (A=0.782) for diagonals/longest, push joints on support shortest, upgrade if max-stress needed. Mass = sum over all members (length Ã— area). Estimate member forces via basic stiffness analogy and geometry.",\n\n    "calculation": "Member set proposed: node_1-node_2, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_1 to close triangle; new diagonals node_3-node_4, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4.
