    "preamble": "Given a 3-node linear configuration subject to unsymmetric external loading and strict mass/stress-to-weight constraints, this single-shot design seeks to configure a closed, lightweight 2D truss by triangulation with potential node insertion. All design decisions tightly follow minimization of the stress-to-weight ratio, global mass, and clarity of load paths through statically determinate triangulation.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs: Three main nodes nearly aligned horizontally, with node_3 intermediate. Loads acting at node_3 (downward left), node_1 is pinned, others as rollers. All must be structurally connected and augmented if optimality can be improved. Constraint targets are formidable: stress-to-weight <= 1.0 and mass <= 30 (via preselected, discrete cross sections).",

    "analysis": "Direct condition: loads (-15, -30)N at node_3 demand both x and y control. node_1 pinned, so x/y restraint at one end, while node_2, node_3 permit translations constrained via roller conditions. With only one internal node and a triangular layout possible, but spread is wide horizontally; direct (node_1-node_2), diagonals (node_1-node_3) will carry bulk of forces. Adding an elevated node forming a vertical triangle, supporting node_3 vertically upward, redistributes loads more efficiently, reducing member weight and stress concentration. Structural indeterminacy is minimized but stability is maintained. Main failure risk: element overload under unsymmetric force at node_3.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation with a high node above node_3 will help achieve vertical and horizontal force component resolution. Positioning this node above node_3 (y > 0, x ~= node_3) sends force directly to supports via shortest high-angle members, moderating element axial stresses. Closed network and all connections remain practical as vertical and diagonal members are highly effective in such geometry. Area selections start with small (<0.782) values for secondary, with primary diagonals needing moderately larger sizes.",

    "reasoning": "Introduce 'node_4' at (2.0, 3.5) to create two triangles: (node_1-node_3-node_4), (node_2-node_3-node_4). This gives an efficient, lightweight, statically determinate planar system rather than a heavy single-span. It routes loads from node_3 more directly upwards and sideways to supports, so axial forces required are minimized for mass. All connections now must reference unique nodes. Select minimal viable area_ids commensurate with load magnitude and member force estimates.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: area list directly packs mass. Steel E and yield params not enforced, only stress-to-weight by definition. Cross-sectional area (A) from discrete IDs found from lengths: l(node_1-node_2)=6, l(node_1-node_3)=2, l(node_2-node_3)=4, diag(node_3-node_4)=3.5, etc. Force assignment: main diagonal carries 'vertical' (load_y/2/sin(theta)), less for horizon joins. Optimize by equivalence: Try areas '2' (A=0.782) for diagonals/longest, push joints on support shortest, upgrade if max-stress needed. Mass = sum over all members (length Ã— area). Estimate member forces via basic stiffness analogy and geometry.",

    "calculation": "Member set proposed: node_1-node_2, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_1 to close triangle; new diagonals node_3-node_4, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4. Distances: node_1 <-> node_4: sqrt((2-0)^2 + (3.5-0)^2)=~4.04; node_2 <-> node_4=sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-3.5)^2)=~5.31; node_3-node_4=3.5. All exist triangle (node_1, node_2, node_3). Use minimum areas suitable: major loaded = '2', others = '1'. L=members: [(0,0)-(6,0):6], (6,0)-(2,0):4, (2,0)-(0,0):2, (2,0)-(2,3.5):3.5, (0,0)-(2,3.5):4.04, (6,0)-(2,3.5):5.31. Areas (in listed order): ['1','2','1','2','1','1']. Mass calc: 6*0.195+4*0.782+2*0.195+3.5*0.782+4.04*0.195+5.31*0.195=1.17+3.13+0.39+2.74+0.79+1.04=9.26 (well within 30 max). For worst case stress the 'node_2-node_3' carries major share from Fx, so F=15N, area=0.782, s=15/0.782=19.19 N/unit. Total mass=9.26, max(abs(stress))/mass=19.19/9.26=2.07. Exceeds allowable. Try all major-loaded members as area_id='3' (1.759), recalc mass: 6*0.195+4*1.759+2*0.195+3.5*1.759+4.04*0.195+5.31*0.195=1.17+7.04+0.39+6.16+0.79+1.04=16.59. Stress for max member: 15/1.759=8.53. Ratio=8.53/16.59=~0.51 (within constraint!). All design constraints satisfied in this adjustment.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Design uses a single extra node (node_4) above the mid-span for triangulated paths with near-minimal mass, with judicious area upgrades for heavyweight members (node_2-node_3, node_3-node_4) to balance loads while maintaining ALL ratios within 1.0, total weight within constraint. Design is robust, self-justified, and easily justifiable for practical scenario. All connections single, members unique.",
