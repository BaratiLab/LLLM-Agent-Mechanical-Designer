Previous iterations exceeded the total mass limit (constraint: ≤30) and displayed weak stress-to-weight efficiency. Members or node positions can be modified for optimal performance, but locations or types of supports/loads may not change.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Input includes nodes with pinned and roller supports at nodes_1, _2, _3, a heavily loaded node_3, and excessive truss mass (>34) at current minimum stress ratio (<0.2). Previous structures failed either mass or stress constraints or had insufficient triangulation/connection density.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Node_3 carries considerable downward and leftward force, requiring strong support via direct triangulation to both grounded nodes (1,2) for efficient force decomposition. Current topology utilizes intermediate nodes above/along the base which may be too high or unnecessary, causing excessive member length and mass. Past iterations with simplified layouts violated maximum stress constraints. Optimal truss should balance sufficient triangulation, compact span from nodes with supports to loaded node, and minimal redundant length by keeping intermediate nodes close to main path of load transfer.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing node_5 or moving it lower/closer to line through supports will trim member lengths without over-stressing. Using area_ids more selectively—bigger for diagonals and lowest feasible otherwise—should optimize constraints. Remove unnecessary intermediate nodes off primary force path to cut wasted mass.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the structure with a compact, triangular/’fan’ truss: keep supports and load at their positions, add node_4 (apex) above load application node_3 for short diagonals, hinge all force transfer on shortest members. Reduce number and length of elevated intermediate members – orient them more horizontally across the base span. Use small area_id except for most critical load-carrying diagonals.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A triangle formed between supports and load node enables force transfer directly from load node to pinned/roller, exploiting base stability and minimizing length. An apex node reinforces stiffness and enables member mass reduction via statically determinate load sharing along short orthogonal/axial members, especially along high-strength diagonals. Avoid large upper chords as they do not efficiently contribute to vertical load support under this asymmetric loading. Diagonal and direct base braces should be sized up, vertical and upper members minimized in section.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assign node_4 above or nearly above node_3, at modest y to allow short members to base support; tie to nodes 1,2,3. Use lowest possible area for horizontal ties/base, moderate for vertical/diagonals. Calculate each member\'s effective force by resolving joint equilibrium, estimate peak member forces—especially those between load and supports.",\n    \n    "calculation": "All nodes and loads defined; node_3 carries -15,-30. Pinned at node_1 (0,0); roller at node_2 (6,0) and node_3 (loaded). Place apex node_4 at (3, 1). Create triangular connections: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, close the structure with optional node_5 directly above node_3 at (3,0.6) for a second (lower) apex for even tighter truss. Members along base and short tiers above; lengths: base = 6, legs ~= 3.16 (sqrt((3)^2+(1)^2)), verticals ~1 or less. Assign minimal areas for horizontal/less-strained, moderate (id=\'2\'= 0.782) for diagonals under bulk of axial load, rest at \'1\'. Compute total mass: base 6×0.195, diagonal 3.16×0.782 (x4), short vertical (0.6/1)x0.195, total ~7 or less.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Confirm that: (max(stress)/total_mass) ≤1, and total mass <30. Structure is closed (all nodes connected), no duplicate nodes/members, adheres to area_id choices. All original support/load nodes remain unmoved. Use concise coordinates with 1e-2 precision.
