    "preamble": "This truss optimization problem involves three collinear base nodes, fixed and roller supports, a concentrated load on one node, and a strict stress-to-weight constraint. The task demands a fully closed (connected) truss design that minimizes the stress-to-weight ratio, keeps total mass < 30 units, and satisfies connectivity.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives: Fully connected truss, <30 mass, stress/weight ≤ 1.0. Nodes are collinear (x-axis). To avoid a structure prone to high bending, triangulation is necessary—requires at least one additional node off the x-axis. Load is highly eccentric at node_3. A classic Warren truss layout with an apex above the x-axis is most optimal for both strength-to-weight and ease of force transfer.",
    
    "analysis": "Collocated supports (node_1 pinned, node_2 and node_3 rollers) imply indeterminate reactions but a statically doable setup for a small truss. All nodes given (except any we may add) lie on x=0 so as to minimize span; however a proper solution requires a triangulated, non-collinear setup (planar rigidity). Primary risks: (1) Not adding an apex node results in zero structural depth (=catastrophic for bending/stress). (2) If the closed member directly under the line of force is too slender, stress will be excessive. Adding a top node centrally (form a triangle) is structurally proven as optimal (shortest, most direct compressive/tensile paths from load to supports).",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "The members between support nodes will tie the base, but most forces will pass via the added top node. Keeping height low reduces excess length/mass but increases stress; conversely, higher apex means lower stress but higher mass. Choosing a height that brings stress-to-weight just below 1.0 is optimal. Most areas should be small, only highly loaded members need a higher cross section for efficiency.",
    
    "reasoning": "Add node_4 as apex above the base (centrally, to optimize load path from node_3). Position apex at x=3.0 (center between base) and y=1.30 (calculated below) ensures all nodes are connected, planar rigidity and decent load triangulation. Truss members: base chord (node_1-node_2-node_3-base), and triangle legs (each base node to the apex; apex to node_3 directly). Assign smaller areas to lightly loaded diagonal, larger to legs carrying the vertical span. Double check all connections are unique.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Key equations: \n - Lengths via Pythagoras. \n - Member forces by hand via method of joints, assuming pin joints. \n - All supports on y=0 → just vertical reactions (node_1 both directions, node_2/3 uplift only). \n - Static equilibrium (FX, FY = 0). \n - Effective height derived from acceptable stress-to-weight: Let maximum member force ~load → length ~√(x^2+height^2). Internal member must carry vertical. Use smallest sufficient member areas (from allowed list by ID). Overall mass: sum(length × area_id_value). All constraints enforced.",
