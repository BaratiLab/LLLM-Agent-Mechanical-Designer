Prior attempts—both the latest and those in history—fail stress-to-weight constraints and have various mass and force inefficiencies. The structure must connect the three supported nodes and at least two unused, \'floating\' nodes to enable efficient triangle-based load paths.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs define must-hit: all nodes, including loaded and supported points cannot move. The solution must achieve a better stress distribution, more efficient triangulation, and likely use modest-cross-section members to both decrease mass and avoid local overstress. The most recent and similar history (constraint_not_met_5) shows overstress, long diagonal tension with small areas.",\n    "analysis": "Current design features a trapezoidal \'box\' over nodes [0,6] and [2.0, 2.4/5.0,2.4], with cross-bracing from node_3 to 2nd layer. Main stress concentration is in member_1 (node_1 to node_3), approaching 54 in stress for 0.39 mass, causing the ratio violation. Most members show far lower stresses, suggesting imbalanced utility of members: overreliance on diagonals rather than distributing force broadly. Lower-area members in top (area_id 1) are not enough for tension. History shows conventional \'fan\' solutions (e.g. \'constraint_not_met_1\', \'2\'), fail due to excessive main member loads and heavy use of area \'2\' for needed two-force members.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "History’s lower stressed/massed structures increased area for diagonals, but not enough to solve localized overloads, and area boosts fail ratio. Current design relies heavily on a few small-area main diagonal and lower cord elements, producing stress-to-weight >5. Needed: re-allocate member sizes, improve triangulation directly under/over loaded node, perhaps with additional tie (e.g., break long diagonals or create multiple triangles sharing load onto base) for better force spectrum.",\n    "proposal": "Redesign: Insert a central node above the direct loaded node_3, connect it to all base and top nodes, convert the structure from a trapezoidal grid to fully triangulated Pratt/Howe-like layout. Tune node_4’s y position higher while keeping existing x (as load shed triangle), insert node_6 above node_5, and connect with more top chord bracing. Assign area so all primary force members avoid both under-stiffness and wasteful oversizing. All supports/loads fixed.",\n    "reasoning": "Maybe both over-provide vertical path members and minimize long, highly stressed diagonal members—which past structures can\'t do with only left/middle/right nodes aligned. By increasing the vertical offset above node_3 and adding another upper node above the right-most cluster, the load can be shared over more element paths and direct triangle fans. Placing nodes non-colinearly, forming two clear triangles under top chord, distributes the load to all three base nodes while letting all members contribute. Utilize area_id 2 (0.782) for main diagonals and compressed chords, switch secondary braces to area_id 1 (0.195) for mass savings.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Plan: Move node_4 to (2.0, 3.0) to increase vertical stack over node_3 (diminishing main diagonal inclinations & compression/tension). Add node_6 at (5.0, 3.0) mirrored over node_2. Redefine members as: lower chord: node_1-node_3-node_2 (area_id 2); vertical: node_3-node_4, node_2-node_6 (area_id 2); top chord: node_4-node_6 (area_id 1); diagonals: node_1-node_4, node_3-node_6 (area_id 2), node_4-node_2, node_6-node_1 (area_id 1). Ensure full connectivity—every node participates. Mass estimation uses  √(dx^2+dy^2) * area. Estimate load/stresses for each based on equilibrium and symmetry.",\n    "calculation": "Chord (node_1-node_3): 2.0m, area 0.782 ⇒ 1.564; (node_3-node_2): 4.0m, area 0.782 ⇒ 3.128. Verticals: node_3-node_4, node_2-node_6: 3.0m × 0.782 = 2.346 (each). Top chord: node_4-node_6: (5.0-2.0, both at y=3.0): 3.0m × 0.195 = 0.585. Diagonals: node_1-node_4: 3.0m Δ = 3.6056m × 0.782 = 2.823; node_3-node_6: √((5-2)^2 + (3-0)^2) = 4.24m × 0.782 = 3.318; node_4-node_2: √((6-2)^2 + (3-3)^2) = 4.0 × 0.195=0.78; node_6-node_1 = √((5-0)^2 + 3^2)=5.830m×0.195=1.137. Mass sum: ≈ 1.564 + 3.128 + 2.346 + 2.346 + 0.585 + 2.823 + 3.318 + 0.78 + 1.137 ≈ 17.028. All well below 30. Stresses: for two triangles, max member force likely still under 15 based on force distribution (see histories with main member loads), so stress-to-weight for max force of 14 on heaviest (say chord) ≈ 14 / 17 ≈ 0.82 ≤ 1.0. Details—if max force is (worst) at 20, then ratio=1.176 (above), but geometry distributes around 13/14 over multiple paths.",\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Direct connectivity confirmed. No isolated nodes. Full closure via chords and triangle fans. All supports are strictly unchanged. Mass well below 30 kg threshold.
