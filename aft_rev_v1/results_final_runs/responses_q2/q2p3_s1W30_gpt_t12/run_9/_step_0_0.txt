    "preamble": "This problem asks for a single-shot optimized 2D truss structure using three given nodes with specified supports and a heavy external load. The objective is to minimize the maximum stress-to-weight ratio while keeping structure mass below 30, ensuring the stress-to-weight constraint (<=1.0), and confirming all nodes form a closed, connected truss. Area IDs are selected from a predefined set.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs: nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0); pinned/roller supports; heavy off-axis load at node_3 (2,0) of (-15, -30). Must ensure all nodes are connected, and support vertical/horizontal loads efficiently. Plan: add one intermediate node above base and triangulate to force balance and minimize stresses. Choose member areas to balance minimal weight vs. stress constraint.",
    
    "analysis": "We have three base nodes in near-line arrangement, requiring added stiffness to resist a downward and leftward load. Node_3 is midway and loaded downward/left. Supports ensure vertical/horizontal reactions at node_1, only vertical at node_2 & node_3. Closing and triangulating the truss will minimize stress concentrations. Without an upper node, put everything in 1D (undesired). Using an extra node above (apex) enables a two-triangle (Warren) truss to carry load efficiently by splitting direct, symmetric load paths. Area selection must account for largest member forces to keep max(stress)/mass within 1.0 constraint and weight under 30.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Optimal path: Add node_4 at apex (above node_3). Connect: base (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_2-node_1), plus diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_2-node_4). Triangular network will resist both downward and sideways forces. Highly-stressed members are likely the apex diagonals, so they may need larger area_id. Compute all member lengths, likely select small area_id for short/compression/tension members, balance so ∑length × area ≤ 30.",
    
    "reasoning": "Adding a fourth node above the base provides a geometrically strong triangle, dividing the heavy load efficiently between tension/compression elements. This allows smallest load path lengths, best stress distribution, and minimal mass for given support/load configuration. This optimal shape is a basic variation on a Warren/Gusset frame, ensuring robust constraint satisfaction.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All members made from the same material. E = constant, ignore buckling due to short member length vs. load. Set node_4 at apex (x3, y_apex), will estimate ideal y_apex via geometry — as a minimum, 2.0 units directly above node_3 (x=2.0, y=2.0) allows good load-path angles (approx 45-60 deg from base). Set all base distances, compute member lengths. Area assignment: Start with minimum area = area_id '0' (1), increase for diagonals if stress exceeds ratio constraint, recalc mass to keep ≤30. Rather than iterative design, select areas so all constraints are met in one solution.",
    
    "calculation": "Node_1 (0,0), Node_2 (6,0), Node_3 (2,0), Node_4 (2,2.0). Member lengths: 1-2: 6.00, 2-3: 4.00, 3-1: 2.00; diagonals: (1-4): sqrt(4+4)=2.83, (3-4): 2.00, (2-4): sqrt(16 + 4)=4.47. Assign area_id: Use '2'=0.782 for heavily loaded (1-4, 2-4, 3-4), leave base links at '1'=0.195. Compute mass contribution: (6.00+4.00+2.00)*0.195 + (2.83+2.00+4.47)*0.782 = 12.00*0.195 + 9.30*0.782 = 2.34 + 7.28 = 9.62 < 30 (OK). Compute max expected force using static equilibrium for triangle under a 33.54N resultant load (at 2,0), diagonals at ~54.7°. For upper diagonals: F~|load|(sinθ)/(number of members) ≈ 33.54*0.816/2 ≈ 13.7N, area 0.782, so stress ≈ 17.5; mass = 9.6, ratio = 17.5/9.6 ≈ 1.82 (too high). Move to area_id '4'=3.128 for diagonals: mass becomes 9.3*3.128=29.1, total mass=31.4 (>30), so optimize areas: critical diagonals get area_id '3'=1.759 (mass 9.3*1.759=16.36, total ≈ 18.7, stress 13.7/1.759=7.8, ratio=0.42), meet constraints. All checks OK.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Closed (all nodes connected), triangulated, satisfies constraints. Chosen apex optimizes path. Area assignment: diagonals get '3', base ties get '1'. Total mass=2.34+16.37 ≈ 18.71 (<30). Max stress ~7.8, ratio ~0.42 (<1.0). All instructions adhered to.",
