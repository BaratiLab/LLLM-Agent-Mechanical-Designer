Loads, support, and node constraints are applied, and no support/load location may be moved. The final objective is a minimal-mass, constraint-satisfying, closed truss.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Start by noting the current design (4 nodes, partial top chord), and past history has similar layouts with failed constraints (overstressed member, total mass ~12+). Members using non-minimal areas; high stress in main central members. Constraint to address is the stress-to-weight ratio, not total mass (which is acceptable).",\n\n    "analysis": "All prior designs fail due to high member stress-to-weight ratios — especially in main chords, with the West/East horizontals too lightly braced. Support locations and load magnitudes mean load is unsymmetrical (-15, -30 at node_3, which must remain). Weak upper bracing triggers high stresses in the horizontal chords. A cross-braced, deep triangulation is needed under node_3 to spread the high downward and leftward force efficiently. Member 5 (node_1-node_3) is the most overstressed (-14.13), caused by it acting as the main load path and insufficient backup/truss depth. Lower chords are undersupported. Both historical and current designs lack proper triangulation/bar symmetry: member layout is insufficient to redirect forces efficiently. Node_3 is currently at (2,0) but there’s significant scope to deepen the structure below node_3. All key nodes with supports and loading are fixed by instruction. The configuration is recoverable by introducing more depth and a direct load path below node_3 using additional diagonals and possibly a single new node below the loaded location.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key pattern is undertriangulation under node_3: adding a node below node_3 will shorten compressive/tensile member lengths and relieve horizontal direct-member stresses. I should pair node_5’s top location (above node_3) with a new node below, forming a true triangle beneath node_3, and connect this new node to the supports. Use minimum (area_id=\'1\') for chords under light load, stouter areas for key load path only if absolutely necessary. assess removing lightly loaded top or sidemembers.",\n\n    "proposal": "Propose moving the current upper node (node_5) upward (for wider, deeper triangulation/effective height). Further, introduce a new node (node_6) directly under node_3, orthogonally offset by truss height. This node anchors deeper diagonals, improving vertical load-carrying via better moment-arm leverage, allowing direct load transfer to supports. Remove redundant or underloaded members, and upsize highly stressed members only if area_1 cannot suffice. All members to/from node_3, supports, and  the new lower node to be fully triangulated and yield a closed truss loop for all force paths. Optimize node_5 above the deck for maximum truss depth (allowed by symmetry and geometry). Collection of minimal cross-sectional members (area type \'1\') in most locations unless surplus strength truly needed.",\n\n    "reasoning": "By introducing deep triangulation, maximum span, and orthogonal triangles beneath node_3, the highest applied force is countered vertically by direct tension/compression triangles rather than in long, overstressed horizontals. Load path is distributed among shorter, better-angled members, maintaining force closure and supporting both vertical and leftward load at node_3, via the lower node’s direct path to both end supports. Forces at supports are redirected through diagonals into, not across, the deck chord, allowing most members to use the lightweight \'area_1\', with the critical member (directly resisting applied loads) set at \'area_2\' if initial calculations indicate high axial load. All main triangles will be sized/arranged to avoid member redundancies/overlaps, ensuring a closed structure. I will leave nodes with supports/loads at their locations per instructions.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume standard unit height and width (height/vertical added for sensible load transfer). Propose node_5 shifted upward (say y=2.2 at node_5), place new node_6 directly beneath node_3 at (2.0, -1.8). Calculate all member lengths, initial force estimates using geometry — diagonal tension/compression typically splits at 45°, so new diagonals properly resist downward and leftward loads proportionally. Table step: area_id \'1\' μ=0.195/m; \'2\' = 0.782/m. For main downwards-triangle legs, start with \'area_2\' if axial force >8 predicted, else \'area_1\'. All support-point-to-chord bracing needs to create multi-member closure. Remove overlap/redundancy. Target as many triangles as possible with short legs as effective as feasible.",\n\n    "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_5 moved up at (2.0,2.2); new node_6 placed down at (2.0,-1.8). Calculate deck length [node_1-node_2]: 6.0 m. Estimate diagonals: node_3 to node_6 vertical, node_3 to node_5 vertical/top, each about 2.2 m up/down. Deck chord lengths: node_1 to node_3 (2.0), node_3 to node_2 (4.0), node_1 to node_6 (~2.06), node_2 to node_6 (~4.12). Predicted max axial loads (approx. −30 at node_3) now split between two shorter diagonals and vertical > reduction by 1/(sqrt(2)) by deepening -> estimate max f ≈ 10; on node_3-node_6, expected max compressive. Summing member lengths: DECK: node_1->3 (2.0), 3->2(4.0), node_1->2 (6.0). DIAGONALS: node_3->5 (2.2), 3->6(1.8), node_5->1 (3.01), node_5->2 (4.12), node_6->1(2.06), node_6->2(4.12). Set area_2 for the deck edge members (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_6); rest with area_1. Total estimated length 2+4+6+2.2+1.8+3.01+4.12+2.06+4.12=29.31m, so with most members at 0.195, two at 0.782; mass ≈ (6+2+4)x0.782+rest x0.195 ≈ (~9x0.195) + (6x0.782) = close to 8kg.
