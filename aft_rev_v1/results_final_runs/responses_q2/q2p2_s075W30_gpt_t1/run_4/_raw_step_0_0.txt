Constraints are enforced on total mass and on (max abs(stress) / total structural weight). The objective is a single, optimal, constraint-compliant truss with possible addition of nodes if needed for optimality.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given 3 nodes forming a line along the x-axis (0,0), (6,0), and (2,0), with a highly off-centered load on node_3 (-15, -30). Supports are pinned at node_1 and roller at nodes 2 and 3. The starting structure is unstable for a closed truss (all in a line), so we must add a node out of axis for triangulation (closure), and connect all nodes optimally.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Analyzing the provided setup: Nodes colinear on x-axis. A nonparallel, high-magnitude load at node_3 requires significant stability against uplift and horizontal forces. Pin/roller/roller support layout limits vertical/horizontal resistance. Direct members between all nodes will not resist out-of-plane loads well; closure and triangulation is a must. To close the truss and allow for optimal load transmission, addition of a new node above (or below) the x-axis (forming a triangle) will distribute forces more effectively and create a stiff, light system. Since we are limited in mass, a minimal configuration (triangle/quadrilateral) is preferable.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The main challenge is closure of the structure while staying under mass and stress-to-weight constraints. Triangulation suggests adding one node (node_4) at a calculated height above x-axis for optimal direct load path from node_3. Node_4 will also reduce member length needed for direct load transfer, thus helping with mass. All members must be as short as feasible with highest area only where maximum stress is expected, using lower area where possible. Connecting all four nodes in a loop achieves closure.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A triangle (with an additional node above the x-axis) is structurally the most efficient configuration for a 3-point base: add node_4 at (approx 3.0, h) to split the base and achieve symmetry. Connecting node_4 to each existing node creates four members forming two triangles. We can then choose larger cross section for the highest-force member (node_3-node_4, as it carries the direct load), and lighter sections elsewhere. Chosen h optimizes load angles and member lengths under length/mass constraints. This will minimize the max member force, which is the primary driver of stress-to-weight ratio.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Material properties uniform, stress is force/area, member self-weight is proportional to length and selected area. Load at node_3: vector (-15,-30) kN. Place node_4 at (3.0, 3.5) to ensure geometric efficiency: it is centered and above the truss to allow good triangulation and ideal force direction for the applied load. Members: (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), (node_2-node_1), (node_1-node_4), (node_2-node_4), (node_3-node_4). Total member length and area sum must stay ≤ 30 for mass. Calculate each member\'s length, estimate relative force via force distribution and method of joints, then select cross section so that (max stress/total weight) ≤ 0.75. Use largest area for the most loaded (node_3-node_4), lightest where possible elsewhere.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node_1 (0,0), Node_2 (6,0), Node_3 (2,0), Node_4 (3.0,3.5).

Total length (all members): 6.00+2.00+4.00+4.61+4.61+3.64=24.86. Assign area_id as follows (from highest anticipated load to lowest): node_3-node_4: \'5\' (4.887); node_1-node_3: \'2\' (0.782); node_2-node_3: \'2\' (0.782); node_1-node_2: \'1\' (0.195); node_1-node_4: \'2\' (0.782); node_2-node_4: \'2\' (0.782). Mass: (4.887*3.64)+(0.782*2)+(0.782*4)+(0.195*6)+(0.782*4.61*2)=17.8+1.56+3.13+1.17+7.21=30.9 ~ over by 0.9. Lower area_id for node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4 to \'1\'. Now, (0.195*4.61*2)=1.80. New mass: 17.8+1.56+3.13+1.17+1.80=25.46. Well within 30. Now, max force: applied load 33.54 kN at node_3, most is resisted by node_3-node_4, so set its area high. Stress(node_3-node_4): F/A ~33.54/4.887=6.86. Total weight~25.46. Stress-to-weight: 6.86/25.46=0.27<0.75.
