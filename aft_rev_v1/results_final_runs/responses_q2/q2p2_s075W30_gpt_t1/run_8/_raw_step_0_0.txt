The aim is to generate a closed (fully connected) truss with minimal stress-to-weight ratio and total mass within constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs specify three nodes (two at (0,0) and (6,0), one at (2,0)), two supports (pinned at node_1, rollers at node_2 and node_3), and a downward/leftward external load at node_3. Design must use only these nodes (and optionally new ones), ensure all are connected, and minimize stress-to-mass ratio (≤0.75) and total mass (≤30). Truss must be statically determinate, triangulated, and efficiently transfer given load to supports.",\n    \n    "analysis": "node_1 is pinned (can take both rxn), node_2 and node_3 are rollers (vertical support). node_3 receives a large left/down force, so direct and triangular members to supports are needed. Given nodes are colinear; thus, system needs an off-axis node to provide vertical force resistance and triangulation. Without adding an elevated node, the structure will be a line (unstable and cannot resist vertical loads with only three colinear nodes). A fourth, elevated node (forming a triangle) is efficient.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding only the given three colinear nodes is mechanically insufficient for a stable truss in 2D for vertical/lateral loading. System needs a fourth node above the line (e.g., node_4 at apex). This allows members from node_3 to node_4 and from there to node_1, node_2, and node_3, forming two triangles which is optimal and enforces closed connectivity as required by the problem.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Introduce node_4 at (3.0, 2.8) – slightly above the midpoint between node_2 and node_3, forming a symmetric truss. Members will comprise: base (node_1 to node_2 to node_3), two uprights (node_3-node_4, node_2-node_4), and two diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_3). Proper area selection will ensure stress-to-weight is minimized. Top node placement reduces max member force compared to placing node_4 over a support, and distributes load.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: E = const (all members), area_ids map to given discrete area values. Members in optimal design: node_1-node_2, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_1 (base triangle), node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4 (forming two triangles). Hand-calculate member lengths. Estimate member forces from resolved static loads for equilateral/similar triangles. Use smallest possible adequate area_ids, making sure stress-to-weight ≤0.75 and total mass ≤30. For calculation, area from \'2\' (0.782), \'3\' (1.759), \'4\' (3.128) are candidates. Weight = sum(length×area). Max stress = max(member_force/area). Assign greater area to most loaded members (direct from node_3 towards apex).",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(3,2.8).
