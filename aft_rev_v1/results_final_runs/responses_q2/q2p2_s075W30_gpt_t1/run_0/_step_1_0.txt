    "preamble": "The problem involves optimizing a 2D truss structure subjected to significant loads and support conditions. The current structure has a stress-to-weight ratio (2.57) well above the allowed limit (0.75), though total mass (14.97) is within the 30-unit limit. The objective is to generate a closed truss, preserve supports/loads, and reduce the stress-to-weight ratio below 0.75 while maintaining minimal mass.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given the excessive stress-to-weight ratio but low mass, the main challenge is redistributing forces more efficiently using triangulation and possibly increasing some member cross-sections (areas). The load is placed off-center on node_3, which is also a roller support, which suggests complex force transmission requiring careful member layout.",

    "analysis": "Current structure: Rectangular base (nodes_1,2,3) with two diagonals (members to node_4), but member stresses are highly uneven. The most critical member is member_2 ('node_1', 'node_3'), taking nearly 38.4 units of stress (far in excess of desired), while other members are low. This indicates that triangles are too wide or not well-distributing the oblique load at node_3. Member_6, which ties the top of the triangle, is heavy, penalizing mass. Expanding the truss laterally and vertically may help. No isolated nodes. Structural generation history only reflects this constraint-violating structure.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "The current member arrangement poorly distributes the heavy off-center load and relies too much on the 'node_1'-'node_3' member. To lower per-member stress, create more effective triangulation, possibly by repositioning node_4 upward and perhaps introducing one more node at a moderate height to produce better load-paths. All supports & load positions must remain unchanged.",
    
    "proposal": "Redesign: Shift node_4 higher and to the right to create two shorter triangles sharing node_3, reducing lever arm on member_2. Insert a new node_5 above the beam at (4, 1.6) as an apex to establish shorter, stiffer top chords. Reallocate member areas to favor lower-stress/high-force regions while keeping the mass low, preferring area_ids 2-4.",
    
    "reasoning": "A triangle above node_3 (apex at node_5) creates a more direct load path from the loaded node to both supports. With two stacked triangles, stresses are shared amongst additional diagonals, reducing the load on the critical member_2 by splitting the lateral/vertical load. Making the top member shorter and steeper (vs horizontally wide) lowers bending and keeps most elements in tension or compression. Use larger areas only for the most-loaded members.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All connections are frictionless pins. The load at node_3 is -15 in X and -30 in Y. Calculate approximate force flows: Major diagonals must balance the 15-kN horizontal and 30-kN vertical. Area choices: use '4' for diagonals adjacent to major loads, '2' or '1' for less loaded ties. Estimate total mass by summing member lengths x area coefficients; ensure <30. Calculate major angle: delta_x and delta_y ensure shorter diagonals. Node_4 moves to (1.5,2.6); node_5 is new at (4.0,1.6) giving two connected apexes. All nodes remain part of closed figure.",
    
    "calculation": "Base: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0). Apex left (node_4): (1.5,2.6). Apex right (node_5): (4.0,1.6). Members: base (1-2, 2-3, 1-3), verticals (3-4, 3-5), left and right diagonals (1-4, 2-5), top chord (4-5). Assign area_id '4' to 1-3 (critical), 3-4 (critical), 3-5 (critical); the rest use '2'. Estimate mass: e.g., length(1-3)~2.0, area=3.128→mass~6.3, sum others similar, aiming for mass <30. Stresses expected to be shared almost equally, reducing max(abs(stress)). Stress-to-weight ratio estimate: expect max member ~18, total weight 22→0.82; with more member area, target drops to 0.75. Adjust areas upward if needed on diagonals; reduce on long chords if slack.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Design meets mass limit. Triangulation ensures all nodes participate. Member area allocations concentrate capacity where most needed (at critical diagonals near node_3). Node positions preserve all supports and loads. All member and node names are unique and non-overlapping. All coordinates to 0.01 precision. Structure is closed and robust.",
