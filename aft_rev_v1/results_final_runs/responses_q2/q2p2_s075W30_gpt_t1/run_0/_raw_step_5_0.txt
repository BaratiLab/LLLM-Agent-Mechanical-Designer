The previous design (iteration 4/25) failed the stress-to-weight limitation (0.9835 > 0.75). Our goal is a feasible, closed truss—no isolated nodes—that satisfies all constraints with optimal efficiency.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs show (a) concentrated load at node_3, (b) pinned support at node_1, rollers at nodes 2 and 3, (c) current node spread along x and y axes, (d) some truss members with heavy stress and uneven mass distribution from FEM results, and (e) closed triangulated truss layouts in history, all failing stress-to-weight or mass constraints. Members with high area indicate attempted strengthening, but mass inflates or stress is not redistributed efficiently. Design must balance adequate triangulation without excessive redundancy.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure uses a five-node, nine-member truss with modest triangulation but poor leverage of geometry: (1) The vertical offset of node_4 and node_5 is not maximizing load transfer efficiency, causing high forces in key members; (2) Areas are concentrated on certain members but many are inefficient (e.g., member_5 is very heavy). (3) The load at node_3 is downward and left, so forces need to transfer efficiently up and out to both supports. Reviewing historic \'rank_1\' design: it increases height of node_4 to 2.8, but mass spikes, and efficiency (ratio) is only moderately better. Other historic attempts spread nodes more widely but run into over-stressed chords and heavy members. The constraint not met in every case is stress-to-weight ratio, not just mass. Current arrangement is close but needs to reduce stress concentration and improve force distribution.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Recognize: most effective truss arrangements for single-point heavy loading and two supports are shallow triangular or \'Warren\' or \'Pratt\' style with elongation of the loaded and apex nodes to reduce force in horizontal members and better direct loads to supports. Making members more vertical under load reduces axial force, while shortening heavily loaded members reduces stress. Increasing vertical offset y-coordinates more (by raising node_4 and/or node_5) could help. Properly triangulating between all nodes, using appropriate areas, is critical. Avoid large span members with high forces and area_4 or above. Rather, distribute the load via more members at lower area (e.g., area_1 or area_2 where permissible).",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign node elevations and refine member connections to better triangulate and dissipate forces from node_3 to the supports. Slightly raise node_4 and node_5 to improve geometry but keep node_3 fixed (due to load/roller constraint). Plan a compact, symmetric triangular truss (double triangle/Warren type), ensuring all nodes are used and connected with minimal, moderate cross-section members. Remove excessive area_4/area_5 usage. Maintain fully closed connectivity.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Physics dictates forces are minimized when load paths are shortest and as axial as possible. Elevating node_4 and node_5, and ensuring diagonal bracing (forming two large triangles over the supports and through node_4/node_5), reduces span of heavily loaded members. Depth (vertical rise from supports to loaded node and mid-span nodes) reduces bending and axial stress. Making all vertical/horizontal force transfers symmetric keeps forces balanced and allows use of smaller area members uniformly. Stretch but do not exaggerate the height of node_4/node_5; keep all members triangulated with one or two diagonals from node_3. Avoid redundancy (no parallel members) and exclude area_4 unless strictly essential. Slightly shift node_5 closer to node_3 horizontally for a more compact triangle.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume member forces (F) scale with projection of applied load along member direction and their length: F = load * projection. Large angles from vertical decrease F for main members. Stress in each member = F/area (use area_id table). For mass: mass = sum(member length × area). Use shortest possible heavily loaded members; distribute the rest. Target total mass < 20 kg with majority of members at area_2 (0.782), critical ones (chords/verticals) at area_3 (1.759). Plan two verticals from node_3 to node_4, node_4 to left, and triangulate node_5 near midspan and slightly higher than node_3.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Select node positions: node_1 at (0.0,0.0) (pinned), node_2 at (6.0,0.0) (roller), node_3 at (2.0,0.0) (load/roller), node_4 raised for vertical triangulation: (2.0, 2.6), node_5 for rightside triangle: (4.2, 1.5). Anticipate main force from node_3 to go upward to node_4 and diagonally to node_2/node_5, then distribute via bracing. Use area_2 for diagonals, area_3 for verticals, area_1 for shorter horizontals/brace. Member force estimates: vertical/top chords 10-12 kN, diagonals/braces 4-8 kN, all within allowable stress at chosen areas. Calculate member lengths and total mass; ensure all < 30 kg; recalc stress-to-weight: estimated max stress ~11.4, net mass ~17.2, ratio ~0.66 < 0.75.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Design finalized with all nodes connected, improved elevation of node_4 and slightly shifted node_5.
