    "preamble": "The task is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio (max|stress|/total_weight) for a 2D closed truss structure, supporting required loads and boundary conditions, while ensuring total mass ≤ 30 and (max|stress|/total_weight) ≤ 0.75. The best current design achieves a ratio of 0.256 and mass of 25.70, with all constraints satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "The present truss spans horizontally (nodes along y=0), with a tall node and a mid-height extra node forming a multi-triangle closed system. Member areas are mostly moderate, the structure is statically determinate, and no constraint is violated. The history suggests adding/removing triangles or reducing node heights or redundancy might risk constraints or performance.",
    
    "analysis": "The current design distributes a high downward and leftward load at node_3 (free node at [2.0, 0.0]), with supports at both ends (nodes 1, 2) and at node_3 itself (roller). The main load path proceeds horizontally from node_3 to both supports, while the upper nodes (node_4, node_5) close triangles to stabilize the span and distribute load efficiently. The stresses are well balanced, the maximum usage is at member_1 (largest negative stress), and mass is within bounds. The ranked historic designs with lower area or fewer diagonals failed constraints (exceeded stress-to-weight limits), and alternative patterns either raised stress concentrations (suboptimal) or failed closure. Attempts to reduce mass alone increased peak stress disproportionately, as shown in the generation history.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Pattern: Triangulation is effective, but aggressive thinning amplifies stress. The critical stress is at the loaded node and its direct supports—reducing section here causes constraint violation. Trying to remove high-mass members fails due to load position and span size. Adjusting node heights/nodes away from span ends adds little, as most load is carried efficiently through triangles as shown. All constraints and geometry are already close to optimal. Minor node shifts or member area reductions risk failure since best historic alternatives violate at least one constraint.",
    
    "proposal": "Given these facts, the optimal design is the current structure—maintaining all existing nodes and member areas, as this achieves the lowest possible stress-to-weight while all constraints are satisfied. No further mass or stress reduction is feasible without violating constraints or creating inefficient force paths. I propose to stop and accept the current design.",
    
    "reasoning": "Triangulated trusses efficiently transfer loads; node positions are optimized—raising node_4/node_5 or moving node_3 does not yield lower maximum stress, due to boundary and load conditions. Attempting to thin members produces constraint violations. All members are necessary for stability, and their area assignments balance mass minimization with stress distribution. The structure is already closed, and each design constraint is satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All supports and load nodes are fixed in position. Calculation checks: Max stress (6.58), total mass (25.70), stress-to-weight ratio (0.256) are well below constraints. Design is single-closed and stable. Member areas provide minimum cross-section for the existing stresses. Changes to node layout or area increase stress or mass beyond allowed values as shown in prior data.",
    
    "calculation": "Recomputing mass (sum of member length × area for the given area_ids and layout) matches the provided data: total mass = 25.70 < 30. Max|stress| = 6.58 < (0.75 × 25.70 = 19.27). Alternative design options tested in generation history either increased ratio or violated constraints. No further area reduction or node movement possible without violating optimality, according to available data.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Verified: the current structure is the best known, given the load, supports, and truss pattern. All constraints satisfied. Further optimizations would only re-introduce constraint violations found in previous ranked history. Ready to stop and recommend this as the optimal solution.",
    
    "stop": "True", # No possible structural, geometric, or area optimization can produce a lower stress-to-weight ratio without violating constraints. All alternatives explored in history either cause constraint violations or produce strictly worse designs. This configuration is optimal under the provided design space.
