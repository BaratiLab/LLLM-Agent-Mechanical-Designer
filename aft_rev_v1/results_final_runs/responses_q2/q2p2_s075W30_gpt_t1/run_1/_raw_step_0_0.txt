The main goal is to minimize the maximum stress-to-weight ratio, ensuring (max(abs(stress))/weight) ≤ 0.75 and total mass ≤ 30, by possibly adding optimal nodes and selecting member areas from a discrete list.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given loads and supports define a statically determinate triangle. However, with all nodes on a line (y=0), adding an extra node (raising a truss apex above base) can create triangulation and load spreading, resulting in lower max stresses. Material usage is restricted, so node placement and member sizing must maximize efficiency.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Supports: node_1 = pinned (fixed); node_2 = roller (vertical support); node_3 = roller (vertical support). A load of (-15,-30)N is applied at node_3 (middle of the base). Truss is nearly a straight line but a strong vertical and leftward load on node_3 encourages adding a top node (say node_4 above node_3) and connecting all nodes to close the geometry—forming two triangles sharing base (node_1-node_3-node_2). Members form direct paths from support points to load point, minimizing bending moments. Two load paths: node_3 direct to supports, and diagonals bracing via node_4.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Stress is minimized by placing node_4 such that diagonals split the applied load between the supports efficiently, reducing member forces. A triangle with apex above node_3—ensuring all nodes connected maximally—will lower max force per member. Try placing node_4 at (2,2.8) [equal distance above base, near equilateral triangle], limiting member lengths and mass. Choose smallest area that keeps stress to weight ratio < 0.75 and total mass < 30.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (2.0,2.8) vertically above node_3 forms two optimal triangles—truss becomes {node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4}, connected as: (1-2,1-3,1-4,2-3,2-4,3-4). This effectively distributes load across six members and minimizes any single member\'s max stress while closing the truss. Smallest adequate area sections are preferred. Member lengths are moderate, total mass is kept within constraint.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume members of area_id \'2\' (A = 0.782), check if stress/weight < 0.75 and mass < 30: Member lengths: node_1-node_2:6, node_1-node_3:2, node_2-node_3:4, node_1-node_4:~3.44, node_2-node_4:~4.76, node_3-node_4:2.8; total length=~23.0, total area=6x0.782=4.692, mass=23x0.782=~18.0 <30.
