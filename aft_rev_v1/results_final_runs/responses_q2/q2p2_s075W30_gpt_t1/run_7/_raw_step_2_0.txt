The current structure has a stress-to-weight ratio near unity, violating the max 0.75 constraint, and must be improved to meet both strength and weight requirements within a 30-unit total mass limit.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The objectives are: close truss, all constraints met. Given load and support conditions: high negative vertical and horizontal load at node_3, supports at nodes 1 (pinned), 2 (roller), 3 (roller). Current structure is efficient in mass but barely fails stress-to-weight ratio constraint. Need to achieve max(|stress|)/total_weight <= 0.75 and total_mass <= 30.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Analysis of the current and historic designs shows a 4-node, 6-member basic truss. Both designs utilize a triangle between nodes 1–2–3, with the fourth node (node_4) above for triangulation and force distribution. However, both have member area assignment inefficiencies and node_4 topology that causes overstress, especially in member_3 (node_3 to node_1 or node_2). The current node_4 height (3.2) is quite high, making diagonals long and reducing their effectiveness in force balancing, leading to overloading, especially with a horizontal-vertical load at node_3. Using large areas for long, lightly loaded diagonals in the history (rank_1) led to excessive mass. In addition, unbalanced member sizing (some members sized 1, some 2) is not optimal. To improve, we need to balance member stress more evenly, use the smallest possible cross-sections everywhere, and possibly slightly decrease node_4’s vertical height to sharpen load distribution. The design must not move any of the load/support nodes.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key points: Both previous structures are viable with minor stress overload. Mass is well under limit, leaving area flexibility. The main challenge is overstress in the tension/compression diagonal(s) from node_3 to node_1/node_2. Reducing node_4 height and carefully sizing diagonals help. Perhaps reassigning member areas, especially for the most-loaded member (node_3—node_1), can readily resolve constraint issues without raising total mass above 30.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Keep the four-node closed truss configuration for stability and simplicity, but refine member areas to better match loads. Lower node_4 slightly from (3.2) to ~2.2 height for more efficient geometry (improving angles for force transfer), and increase the most stressed diagonal’s cross-sectional area. Assign minimal (area_id=\'0\') for shortest, less-stressed links, using area_id=\'2\' or \'3\' only where absolutely required. Thus, the structure remains triangular and efficient, with closed force paths and minimal member count.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By leveraging truss design principles—triangularity, short effective load paths, and strategic placement of diagonals—we can ensure all loads are efficiently transferred to supports without excessive member stress or mass. Lowering node_4 slightly shortens diagonals and shifts force angles closer to the orientation of applied loads, reducing peak member forces. Assigning the highest-stress member(s) a slightly larger area allows stress-to-weight ratio compliance with negligible mass increase, since mass margin is high.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume: All loads/support positions fixed. If previous member_3 (node_3 <-> node_1) exceeded 13.59 kN and failed with area_id=\'2\', increasing to area_id=\'3\' (~2.25x area) makes max_stress ~6.0, well within limit and minimal mass increase (~1.0 unit added). Keep node_4 at (3.0, 2.20) to align with load vector at node_3. Assign other diagonals as area_id=\'1\' or \'2\' only if forces are high. Keep base and horizontal chords at minimal area since they’re short and lightly loaded. All nodes remain structurally connected.",\n    \n    "calculation": "New member_3 (node_3-node_1) with area_id=\'3\', length ≈ sqrt((2-0)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 2.0 units. Mass for member_3: 2 * 1.759 = 3.518. All other members short; using area_id=\'1\' yields mass per member ≈ length * 0.195. Diagonals node_3-node_4 and node_1-node_4 are shorter now, so area_id=\'1\' (even \'0\' for node_2-node_4). Summing all member masses should yield total mass ~8 or less, well below constraint. The largest single member stress should now be <7 due to increased area and geometry improvement, so ratio is <0.75.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Design is closed, connected.
