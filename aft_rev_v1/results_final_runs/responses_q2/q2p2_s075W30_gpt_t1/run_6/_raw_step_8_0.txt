The best valid structure in history achieves 0.3365 with a four-node, six-member truss.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "This is an iteratively optimized truss with fixed supports and a single applied load (-15, -30) at node_3. Supports at nodes 1, 2, and 3 constrain their motion. Current design is a triangulated quadrilateral with out-of-plane node_4, using mostly compact areas and member areas (\'2\',\'3\'). All nodes are connected; no floating elements.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Examining the top historical designs, only the 4-node, 6-member structure satisfies all constraints. Larger structures in the history (5+ nodes) either increase stress-to-weight ratio or violate mass and stress constraints due to more members, less effective triangulation, or excessive member forces (e.g., over-elongated or lightly braced elements). Current truss (node_4 at (3.25,2.2)) divides the span into effective triangles, bracing node_3 (loaded) with node_4 to transmit forces efficiently to supports. Member masses are distributed relatively evenly, and no member is severely overstressed (max stress 6.44, well under constraint). Members connected to node_3 see highest stresses (member_2: -6.44, member_3: 1.54, member_6: 1.17), but far from the limit (where higher area could be needed). There’s limited evidence that additional nodes/members would improve stress distribution given the mass constraint.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: All trusses that tried to increase triangulation or add height either failed mass/stress constraints or worsened stress-to-weight. The triangular configuration with one elevated node out-of-plane from loaded node is optimal. Node_4\'s position could be fine-tuned; moving it left/right may rebalance internal forces or slightly reduce main member lengths, marginally improving the ratio, but gains will be small. Deviations outside this form lead to constraint violations.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Slightly optimize the placement of node_4 to minimize the resultant maximum member force and main diagonal lengths, while avoiding destabilizing the geometry. Maintain member assignments and areas but shift node_4 horizontally toward node_3, thus shortening the heavily loaded member (node_3-node_4).",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Optimal trusses under point load and three supports are typically triangles (minimum determinacy, maximum stiffness per weight). Triangulated, closed forms distribute loads well. By shifting node_4 slightly toward node_3 (horizontally), the vertical height above the loaded node is maximized, shortest load path from node_3 to both supports is gained, and force in highly loaded members (especially member_2 and member_6) could reduce, marginally decreasing peak stress and thus stress-to-weight ratio.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume node_1: (0,0) pinned, node_2: (6,0) roller, node_3: (2,0) loaded (-15,-30), node_4: adjust (x, y) near (3.25,2.2). Test small leftward movement to (3.05,2.35); recalc member lengths and estimate mass: sum(len * area). For stress, assume redistribution—force in member_2 and member_6 drops slightly; overall, max(abs(stress)) could decrease by about ~3-5%, total mass nearly constant. No area downsizing feasible, else stress constraint is exceeded.",\n    \n    "calculation": "1) Node_4 moved from (3.25,2.2) to (3.05,2.35):\\n- member_4: node_1-node_4 new length = sqrt((3.05)^2 + (2.35)^2) ≈ 3.80\\n- member_5: node_2-node_4 = sqrt((2.95)^2 + (2.35)^2) ≈ 3.78\\n- member_6: node_3-node_4 = sqrt((1.05)^2 + (2.35)^2) ≈ 2.57 (decreased from 2.61)\\n2) Updated total mass: new member lengths very similar, approximation yields <0.1 reduction, but all well below mass limit of 30.\\n3) Stresses in members adjacent to the load should drop ~3-5% due to better vertical load transfer. Thus, the new estimated max(abs(stress)) ≈ 6.2\\n4) Stress-to-weight ratio ≈ 6.2 / ~19.10 ≈ 0.324—slightly improved.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Nodes with supports/loads unchanged.
