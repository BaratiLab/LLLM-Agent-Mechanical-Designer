Constraints: stress-to-weight <= 0.75 and total mass <= 30. Triangulation and symmetry must be leveraged given the load and geometry.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes are currently collinear at (0,0), (2,0), (6,0). With all supports on the x-axis and a load at node_3, a simple 3-node truss is impossible (no vertical height for triangles), making the structure unstable out of plane. Thus, new nodes must be added above the x-axis to ensure closure and triangulation. Need to optimize node position for minimal mass and stress-to-weight.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Support configuration fixes node_1 in both axes; node_2 and node_3 are rollers, stable in y. The force at node_3 is (-15, -30), a downward-leftward vector; need to resolve this effectively to the supports. A triangular or \'fan\' truss is most efficient. Adding a node above the x-axis (apex) and linking all nodes forms two triangles, distributing stresses favorably. Mass is constrained, so placing the new node close to node_3 but sufficiently high allows for shorter members and less weight while enhancing load dissipation.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "To close the truss and triagulate, a single apex node above (x, y) = (3, h) is logical, where x = 3 (mid-span), h as small as possible to avoid excessive member lengths but sufficient for triangulation benefits. This apex will connect to all base nodes, forming three triangles. Symmetry in placement, but allow the apex to shift toward node_3 to shorten the high-stress leg.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Place node_4 at (3.5, 2.2): (1) Brings apex near the load, (2) Keeps member lengths moderate, (3) Triangulates and closes the structure for all-node connectivity, (4) Shifts more load to shorter, steeper members, improving stress and weight distribution. Direct links: (node_1, node_4), (node_2, node_4), (node_3, node_4) plus base links (node_1, node_2), (node_2, node_3), (node_3, node_1). Use minimum area members on longest spans and higher areas at key loaded members. This limits mass, balances failure modes, and closes the truss.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume all members are pin-jointed and loaded axially. Use mass = Î£(length * area). Area options enumerate member strength. For stresses, estimate member forces via method of joints: a) \'Apex\' members mainly take the vertical load from node_3 to node_1 and node_4. b) Lower base members stabilize and tie, carry lesser axial force. Select areas: select mid-range area_ids for load path, minimum for non-critical members. Ensure total mass under 30 and stress-to-weight under 0.75. Calculations: member lengths via distance formula, member forces via equilibrium for the loaded joint (node_3).",\n    \n    "calculation": "Nodes: node_1: (0.0, 0.0), node_2: (6.0, 0.0), node_3: (2.0, 0.0), node_4: (3.5, 2.2).
