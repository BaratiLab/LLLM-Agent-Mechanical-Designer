    "preamble": "The problem is to generate an optimized, constraint-satisfying 2D truss for a set of fixed node locations, supports, and one external load. The current structure and past designs either violate the stress-to-weight ratio constraint or have excessive total mass. The objective is to produce a closed truss structure that minimizes the stress-to-weight ratio (≤0.75) and total mass (≤30), adhering strictly to all geometric and definition rules.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "I must interpret the goal: minimize stress-to-weight ratio and mass, ensure the structure is closed, connected, meets constraints, and preserves the locations of nodes with supports/loads.",

    "analysis": "Examining tested structures, the following patterns are evident: weight-lean designs lead to excessive stress-to-weight ratios, while heavier or duplicate-membered designs satisfy stresses but push mass too high. Current trusses use five nodes in a nearly symmetric array, with central loaded node_3 on the bottom chord, side supports at node_1 and node_2 (pinned/roller), and a roller at the loaded node. The load at node_3 is downward and significant: (-15.0, -30.0). Current and historic structures form vertical 'tower'-type shapes (nodes 1-2-3 on the base and 4/5 above), with heavy central trussing and redundant membering between upper nodes. Key constraint violation recurring is stress-to-weight ratio (>1.3), meaning stress paths concentrate forces into specific slender members (especially those leading to the loaded node). The historic best design halves the stress-to-weight ratio, but at the cost of doubling total mass—a suboptimal tradeoff.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "The loaded node (node_3 at [2.0, 0.0]) is not at midspan, making symmetry less effective. Both past approaches fail because either (a) the lower chord is under-dimensioned and takes excessive force, or (b) extra bracing raises mass. Reducing member redundancy and excessive length above base, and relying on direct triangulation to the loaded node, may spread stress better; the key goal is to make near-direct load paths from node_3 vertically and diagonally to upper nodes, tied robustly to both supports. Redundant top chord members should be minimized.",

    "proposal": "Redesign the structure using a lighter upper arrangement and minimal, efficient triangulation to spread the load from node_3, while retaining current support node positions and the loaded node. Fine-tune the upper node positions (nodes_4, node_5) for directness, shifting downward/laterally as needed. Remove unnecessary members in the superstructure, limit the use of heavy cross-members, and optimize member areas for the most loaded elements only.",
    
    "reasoning": "A minimal, efficient Warren truss-like topology provides short, direct load paths with fewer heavy members. Locating the upper nodes lower reduces member length and mass. Assign larger area to only highly-stressed diagonals (especially those directly supporting loaded node_3), with lighter cross-members elsewhere. This brings down both max stress and mass, improving the stress-to-weight ratio. The closed configuration is preserved by ensuring all nodes connect to their neighbors and base supports, forming triangles, but avoids excess top cross-bracing. Key principle: diagonalize load flow from node_3 to supports at node_1 and node_2 through well-proportioned triangles.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume members directly supporting node_3 (vertical and key diagonals to node_4) will see the highest stresses. Assign area_id=2 or 3 to those, area_id=1 for non-critical members. Use mass formula: sum(length * area) with props from provided dictionary. Node_3 stays at (2.0, 0.0). Move node_4 and node_5 to e.g. [(2.6, 2.0),(1.6, 2.0)] for compactness and efficiency—both above the base close to the loaded node for optimal force angles. Members: direct connections from node_3 to node_4 and node_5; connect node_1 and node_2 directly to node_4 and node_5; upper node cross-connection for closure; base chord node_1--node_2--node_3. Each connection forms triangles spreading force and maintains closure.",
    
    "calculation": "Estimate key member lengths: node_3 to node_4: sqrt((2.6-2.0)^2+(2.0-0.0)^2)≈2.09, node_3 to node_5: sqrt((1.6-2.0)^2+(2.0-0.0)^2)≈2.04. Base chord node_1-node_3: 2.0, node_2-node_3: 4.0. Upper cross: sqrt((2.6-1.6)^2)=1.0. Keeping area_id=2 for critical diagonals, area_id=1 elsewhere. Mass: (est) 0.782×4.1 + 0.195×4.0 + ... < 8. Stress: with closer upper nodes, shorter members, and wider triangle base, reduces compression/tension per member. Expect good factor of safety for both constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Final check: All nodes connected, no isolations. Nodes with supports/loads unaltered. No excessive member count; only essential members for triangulation and closure. Assign member areas favoring largest likely stressors; mass estimate well under 30. Structure is closed. Output node positions to 2 decimal accuracy.",
