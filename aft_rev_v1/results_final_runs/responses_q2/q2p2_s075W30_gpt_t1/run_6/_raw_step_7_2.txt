The current and historic designs do not meet these requirements; an improved structure is thus needed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: Closed, efficient, and feasible truss under pinned/roller supports and a downward+leftward load at node_3. Input history shows overloading members or overly reduced cross-sections. Connections and geometry must improve load distribution and avoid member overstress.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Supports: node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 (roller). Loads: node_3 (-15, -30). Current design and much of history result in overstressed bottom chords, inefficient member utilization, or inadequate triangulation, as seen by stress-to-weight >0.75 or overly high stress in a few members. Notably, most failures involve too much load being carried by a single bottom chord member (node_1-node_3), and not enough triangulation in the vertical direction—which would reduce member forces by shortening force paths and improving internal force balance. Stress-to-weight is consistently ≈0.9 in the best past design; mass is well within limits but constraints not met due to overstress. Lack of triangulation, especially near the loaded node_3, is a recurring pattern.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "To prevent overstress, node_3 (load) should be vertically braced to upper chords, creating triangles for load dispersion. Raising existing top nodes and extending the truss height can lengthen load paths and lower member forces. The simplest effective closed truss shapes for such support/load conditions are either a Warren or Pratt truss with a high-placed central \'apex\' node to balance the load. Past apex nodes were either too high (wasting material) or too low (overloading bottom member). Using modest height and triangulation can cut peak stress.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the structure to create a triangulated, efficient shape: keep support and load nodes fixed, introduce one upper node (\'node_4\'); connect all four nodes (nodes 1/2/3/4) in a fully triangulated network. This forms two triangles above the base, ensuring both stability and short force paths. Key is connecting the upper node \'node_4\' directly to the loaded node, and also to supports, distributing the applied force efficiently.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A single top chord node placed ~midway and above the loaded node (node_3) will transform the truss into a stable triangular shape, minimizing force in the lower member and sharing the load among upper diagonals and chords. With pinned node_1 and rollers at nodes 2 and 3, proper triangulation prevents mechanisms and shares applied force efficiently. Shorter panel points and more direct load transfer avoids heavy compressive/tensile forces in any single member. Use area \'2\' (0.782) for main chords/diagonals except for critical high-force members (assign 3 or 4 as justified by calculation). Will manually check that member stresses remain below constraint.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Set up: \\n- Keep node_1 at (0,0), node_2 at (6,0), node_3 at (2,0).\\n- Place node_4 at approx (3.25,2.2): above load, not too high to waste material, but high enough to split force paths.\\n- Members: (1-2), (1-3), (2-3), (1-4), (2-4), (3-4) — minimally triangulated, all nodes closed/connected.\\n- Calculate approximate member forces (assume load resolves mostly by upper bracing/framing; stress in member_2 (node_1-node_3) reduced vs earlier).\\n- Main lower chords: area \'2\' (unless overstressed — in which case boost).</br>- Use l = length, m = sum(l*area) for mass, check total, keep under 30.\\n- Estimate stress: with two bracing triangles, expect reduction in peak member force by ~35% relative to current designs (due to triangulation).
