    "preamble": "Given a 2D truss with pinned and roller supports at nodes 1, 2, and 3, and a downward/inclined force at node_3, the current design and all historic designs violate the max stress-to-weight ratio constraint (must be ≤ 0.75); mass is not constraining. The goal is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio while fully satisfying all constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Reviewing node positions and member assignments shows high local stresses, particularly in high-force direct members (node_1–node_3, etc.), especially using minimal cross-sectional area (area_id '1') in heavily loaded members. Most previous attempts at area distribution/mass minimization violate the stress-to-weight constraint; only one conservative design meets it, but at high mass. Need to redistribute load paths, increase critical member areas, slightly reposition upper nodes for better force resolution, and ensure a closed triangulated structure.",
    
    "analysis": "The provided load is large and off-vertical at node_3, tending to induce high chord (bottom member) and upper diagonal compression/tension. Past designs (see rank_1) used robust area allocation but overshot the mass upper bound. Attempted reductions of member mass led to constraint violations (max_stress_to_weight_ratio > 0.75). Too-thin bottom or diagonal chords become overstressed, causing failure of the constraint, especially for member_1 (node_1–node_3) and member_2 (node_3–node_2) which were consistently thin and high-stressed. Designs with more shallow triangles often failed to resolve vertical force efficiently, whereas historic 'heavier' triangles remained well below the stress ratio constraint. Moreover, all nodes must remain connected for structural integrity.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "A clear pattern emerges: prioritize stress-to-weight constraint by using larger cross-sectional area on critical members (bottom chord, diagonals near node_3), even if some mass increase; fine-tune upper node placement to resolve vertical loads more directly (raise y of node_4/node_5). Remove redundancy while retaining a closed, triangulated configuration. Lower/raise nodes 4 and 5 to increase force path angles, and increase area of bottom chord near node_3.",
    
    "proposal": "Redesign structure using five nodes (no isolated nodes). Maintain historic node_1, node_2, node_3 positions for constraints. Place node_4 and node_5 higher and spread them horizontally for better triangulation and force distribution. Assign minimum feasible area to lightly loaded members, higher area to bottom chord (node_1–node_3 and node_3–node_2). Ensure a closed set of triangles. Use primarily area_id '2' (0.782) for frame, but area_id '3' (1.759) or '4' (3.128) for high-stress bottom chord. Design so mass remains comfortably under 30 and stress-to-weight ratio below 0.75.",
    
    "reasoning": "Based on statics, the direct force path from node_3 to node_1 and node_2 must be robust. Raising nodes_4 and 5 improves their ability to absorb vertical force by geometry, reducing stresses in bottom chord. By increasing the area of only highly loaded members, and keeping all other members as slim triangles, mass can be optimized. The entire structure forms two stacked triangles (Warren truss) with diagonal bracing for closed load paths, minimizing single-member overstress.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Bottom members (node_1–node_3, node_3–node_2) carry the highest force; allocate area_id '4' (3.128) to these. Remaining web/upper members use area_id '1' (0.195) or '2' (0.782) based on proximity to load. Set node_4 at (1.4, 3.2) and node_5 at (4.6, 3.2) for strong vertical force component; this gives steeper diagonals and efficient triangulation. Calculate mass for each: e.g., |node_1–node_3| = 2.0, mass = 2.0 * 3.128 = 6.256. Calculate max stress (assume bottom chord carries nearly total vertical force component, approx 33 N), over mass sum ~19.5; estimated ratio <0.75. Recursively optimize area_id if all constraints are met.",
    
    "calculation": "Members node_1–node_3 and node_3–node_2: length 2.0 and 4.0, area 3.128, mass=6.256 and 12.512, max stress per chord ~load/area, i.e., 33/3.128 ≈ 10.55 (well below critical values in past designs). For web/diagonals, use area=0.782, mass per member ~ under 3 each. Total mass: 6.256+12.512+rest ≈ under 25. Estimated max stress-to-weight ratio: all members <11, mass >20, ratio <0.75. All nodes connected, strong triangulation, geometry helps distribute load.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Critical members sized robustly, upper nodes adjusted for efficient load transfer. All members connected, structure is a closed set of triangles. Estimated total mass <30, stress-to-weight ratio well under 0.75, no constraint violated. Now prepare output with node positions and member definitions with correct area IDs.",
