    "preamble" :  "This problem involves optimizing a 2D truss structure composed of three fixed nodes with specified supports and a significant external load, subject to constraints on stress-to-weight ratio and total mass. The aim is to generate a fully-connected, load-effective (closed) truss by optionally introducing supplementary nodes and judiciously sizing members, ensuring constraints are not violated while minimizing stress-to-weight ratio.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "The basic structure with three nodes nearly aligned on the x-axis and one node subjected to a nontrivial load is prone to high member forces and instability. Triangulation is essential for structural stability and constraint satisfaction. Maintaining a closed, triangulated truss, possible via adding a well-placed node above the existing ones, will optimize load path and material use within the weight and stress limits.",

    "analysis": "Given nodes form a slender triangle (node_1: pinned at (0,0), node_2: roller at (6,0), node_3: roller at (2,0)), with node_3 receiving a significant downward and leftward load (-15, -30). The baseline triangle (nodes 1-2-3) is flat, so adding a new node above the span (Y>0) will enable a stiff, triangulated, force-efficient structure. Node_1â€™s pinned support fully constrains the location; node_2 and node_3 as rollers can only react vertically. Efficient design demands symmetrical, direct load-carrying members. A single top node at (3.0, 2.0), above the centroid, splits the longest span, forming two smaller triangles for optimal force distribution. Members will be chosen to balance load by direct, short force paths and minimal weight.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "A single upper node gives two approximately equal-height triangles, lowering peak member stress and providing efficient triangulation. Placing the node at (3.0, 2.0) ensures geometric symmetry and maximal reduction of member spans, reducing buckling and overall weight. This set-up lets the major applied load at node_3 be carried via short compressive and tensile members to supports. Forces will be analyzed for all members, prioritizing large area sections in high-force paths (e.g., diagonal members from loaded node_3 to the upper node, and from the upper node to the supports). Areas will be chosen smallest possible while satisfying stress/weight ratio constraint and overall mass cap.",

    "reasoning": "Introducing 'node_4' at (3.0, 2.0) creates two adjacent triangles. The new closed truss has nodes: node_1, node_2, node_3, and node_4. Connect as follows: (node_1-node_2), (node_2-node_3), (node_3-node_1) for baseline; add (node_1-node_4), (node_2-node_4), and (node_3-node_4) to complete triangulation. This distributes bending, reduces span forces, and produces direct load paths. Stringently select member areas based on force projections; upsize (using area_id='1' or '2') for diagonals, '0' for short horizontals, keeping mass under 30 and max(abs(stress))/mass under 0.75.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume uniform E and yield, unit out-of-plane thickness (truss is ideal pin-jointed). Key equations:\n- Member Length: sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)\n- Mass: sum(length * area)\n- Section area: area_id mapping per spec\n- Member force via statics (joint equilibrium): Calculate approximate peak member force at loaded node_3; estimate stress = force/area. For mass, sum all member volumes (length * area). Select areas so max(|stress|)/total_weight <= 0.75 and total mass <= 30.\nMajor load flows from node_3 diagonally up to node_4 and horizontally to node_1 and node_2. Downforce split among diagonals. Use trigonometric projection to estimate member forces for initial area selection.",

    "calculation": "Member lengths (rounded, based on node positions):\nnode_1 (0,0), node_3 (2,0): 2.00\nnode_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0): 4.00\nnode_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0): 6.00\nnode_4 (3,2):\nnode_1-node_4: sqrt(9+4)=3.61\nnode_2-node_4: sqrt(9+4)=3.61\nnode_3-node_4: sqrt(1+4)=2.24\n\nAssign area_ids: major diagonal (node_3-node_4), node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4 as area_id='2' (area=0.782); horizontal members as area_id='1' (0.195).\n\nTotal length: 2+4+6+3.61+3.61+2.24=21.46\nTotal mass: (2+4+6)*0.195 + (3.61+3.61+2.24)*0.782 = 2.34+8.01 = 10.35 < 30 (safe)\nEstimate max member force using joint method at node_3: load vector (-15,-30); resolved along two diagonals. Assume worst-case 18 kN per major member for calc: stress=|F|/A=18/0.782 = 23 MPa. Stress-to-weight ratio: 23/10.35=2.22 (>0.75), so upsize diagonals to area_id='4' (3.128), area=3.128\nRecalculate mass: (2+4+6)*0.195=2.34; (3.61+3.61+2.24)*3.128=30.04\nTotal mass=32.38 > 30 (over mass), tune down: assign area_id='3' (1.759, area=1.759) for diagonals. Diagonal members mass=(3.61+3.61+2.24)*1.759=16.75; total mass=2.34+16.75=19.09 (<30). Max stress=18/1.759=10.23; stress-to-weight=10.23/19.09=0.54 (<0.75). All constraints satisfied.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "Nodes are (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), and (3,2). Members fully close the truss: (1-2), (2-3), (3-1), plus triangulation to new 'top' apex (3,2) from all lower nodes. Member areas: horizontals use smallest (area_id='1'), triangulated diagonals use '3' (area=1.759); sum of mass and stress-to-weight within constraints. All integer area IDs used, all nodes unique, all members referenced uniquely. No duplicates. Final check: total mass < 30, stress/weight < 0.75, structure closed, all nodes connected. Design leverages optimal triangulated geometry for this load configuration.",
