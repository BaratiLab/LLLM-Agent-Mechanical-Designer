We must create a minimized, optimized truss with all supports fixed, load conditions met, and a mass far less than cap. Feasibility and constraint satisfaction takes priority over further minimization. No change to loaded/support nodes is allowed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs clarify support, load, and allowable modifications. The stress-to-weight violations in past and current attempts stem from high local forces in key compression/tension members at node_3 (with stress 51.84 and ratio 5.3). Total mass is low, but maximizing area consistently increases mass and ruins efficiency. Both prior attempts attempt broader top chords without efficient triangulation. Triangulation, member sizing, and direct force path must be optimized.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure: Five nodes, nine members, with a fan-like arrangement at node_3 connecting to raised nodes 4 and 5 (at x≈1.4,4.6; y=2.5), forming a shallow arch above the loaded node_3. However, the largest member stress -51.84 is far above allowable for this structure\'s mass, and stress-to-weight ratio is too large (5.3 vs 0.75 allowed). The historic, more compact triangular design is even weaker (1.77 ratio, with enormous mass 18.9). Most stress localizes near the loaded node and along lower chord members connecting nodes 1-3 (tension) and 3-2. The member between loaded node and pinned node takes nearly all the stress, which suggests a lack of direct triangulation supporting the vertical and horizontal reactions from the load. There is also inefficient use of the upper nodes—antinodes above don\'t effectively channel the vertical load to the supports.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: The stress arises in direct lower chords near node_3 because there\'s no direct vertical member or diagonal bracing connecting \'roof\' nodes (node_4, node_5) efficiently down to both supports. This is a classic problem in under-triangulated trusses under downward eccentric loads. The shallow arch is not producing enough height for efficient vertical force transfer. I should raise and symmetrize the upper chord, directly tie node_3 upwards, and make a compact, stiff, symmetric Pratt/Warren-shaped truss to force load into triangulated patterns. Reducing lower member length reduces force. Every node must be used for efficient triangulation.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign using a compact, highly triangulated five-node truss that places nodes_4 and 5 symmetrically above node_3, forming a tall triangle. Connect node_4 and node_5 directly upward above node_3, with diagonal members forming classic Warren (alternating diagonals) or Pratt (diagonals in one direction) truss pattern. Add a direct vertical from node_3 to upper chord for vertical force transfer. Member cross-sectional areas set to higher values only where necessary to handle local forces, minimizing total mass. Member lengths minimized to manage stress.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation minimizes member forces and distributes load paths, preventing overstressing individual members. Raising upper chord nodes (node_4 and node_5) increases depth, reducing force in lower chords (lever arm principle). Adding direct vertical from loaded node_3 upwards splits vertical/horizontal forces cleanly. Connecting node_4 and node_5 to both supports ensures redundancy and lowers peak force in each member. Sizing member areas according to anticipated force will keep stress within mass constraint.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Key assumptions: (1) Heavy vertical and leftward load at node_3 creates high moments, so vertical and diagonal bracing must absorb most reaction. (2) Maximum member stress cannot exceed allowable for given low mass. (3) Members in lower chords (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2) sized for larger area. Upper members experience lower force, smaller area. Calculations: Estimate member forces by method of joints; for a symmetric triangle with vertical at node_3, expect about 60–80% of load through vertical, remaining split into diagonals to supports. Areas: use \'4\' (A=3.128) for main load paths; \'1\' (A=0.195) elsewhere.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Assume upper chord nodes at x=2.0±1.0, y=2.8, to maximize height above node_3. Members: (1) node_1-node_3 (lower chord), (2) node_3-node_2 (lower chord), (3) node_1-node_4 (left diag), (4) node_4-node_3 (vertical, main force), (5) node_5-node_3 (vertical, main force), (6) node_2-node_5 (right diag), (7) node_4-node_5 (upper chord), (8) node_1-node_5 (left upper diag), (9) node_4-node_2 (right upper diag). For each, estimate length and assign area. Lower chords and vertical get A=\'4\' (A=3.128); diagonals/upper chords get area=\'1\' or \'2\'. Estimate member mass: mass = sum(length × area). For the longest member (~3.5 units, area 3.128): ≈11 units. For diagonal/upper, much less. Total estimated well under 30. Maximum member force: estimate not to exceed 22 (less than 0.75 × total weight), with total weight ≈21. Constraint met.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Verify: All nodes used, load connected, supports unchanged, no isolated nodes. All members connected and truss is closed.
