    "preamble": "This is a closed 2D truss optimization for three given nodes (one loaded, two supported), with the goal to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio (max abs stress / total weight), subject to closed-structure, area, and mass constraints. The design must be fully connected and structurally efficient.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs: Small triangle with nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0). Node_1 is pinned, node_2 and node_3 are rollers. A force of (-15, -30) acts at node_3. Minimize stress-to-weight ratio, keep mass <= 30, and must not exceed ratio 0.75. Must use areas from the provided dictionary. Add extra nodes only if solution is suboptimal without them.",

    "analysis": "Truss must transmit a significant downward and leftward load at node_3 toward the supports at node_1 and node_2. The naive approach creates a triangle: members (node_1, node_2), (node_2, node_3), (node_3, node_1). But intense force at node_3 may overstress the directly connected members, especially (node_3, node_1). Triangulation improves force distribution. As geometric spread in y is zero for nodes 1-2-3, adding a fourth node above the base (at y>0) allows for diamond or Warren truss configuration for improved stress distribution (and reduces max stress for the same mass). Chosen node should be at a height that balances load paths and keeps all member sizes reasonable.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Direct triangle will result in high stresses (zero y extent means poor vertical component). Introducing a fourth node above the line increases vertical carry capacity and creates better triangulation. The new node should not be too high (to save member length and mass), but enough to improve vertical equilibrium, perhaps above node_3 for maximum effect.",
    
    "reasoning": "Design principle: Place a new node directly above the loaded node_3 at (2.0, y), with y positive. Members: (node_1, node_3), (node_1, new_node), (node_2, node_3), (node_2, new_node), and (node_3, new_node). This creates two triangles (node_1-node_3-new_node) and (node_2-node_3-new_node), and a base (node_1, node_2) for closure. This triangulation distributes the vertical and horizontal loads to supports more efficiently, greatly reducing maximum individual member stress relative to weight, while still being materially efficient. Choose y such that member lengths remain reasonable (tradeoff between vertical leverage and added mass). Try y = 2.5.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume cross sections from area_id dict. For mass estimate, use total length × area. Quick geometry: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (2,2.50). Member lengths: node_1-node_2=6.0, node_1-node_3=2.0, node_2-node_3=4.0, node_3-node_4=2.5, node_1-node_4=sqrt(2^2+2.5^2)=3.20, node_2-node_4=sqrt(4^2+2.5^2)=4.72. Assign smallest possible area to non-critical members, larger to (node_3, node_4) and those taking most load. Estimate forces: Assume truss distributes force by geometry and solve static equilibrium at joint node_3 (noting supports and the arrangement). Pick minimal area_id meeting allowable stress but still under total mass constraint.",
    
    "calculation": "Member lengths: (1-2):6.0, (1-3):2.0, (2-3):4.0, (3-4):2.50, (1-4):3.20, (2-4):4.72. Total length ≈ 22.42. Mass (with area selection): Assign area_id '1' (0.195) to (1-2), (1-3), (2-3), (1-4), (2-4). Give member (3-4), which carries concentrated load, area_id '3' (1.759). Mass=6*0.195+2*0.195+4*0.195+2.5*1.759+3.20*0.195+4.72*0.195=1.17+0.39+0.78+4.40+0.62+0.92=8.29<30. Approximating force distribution using geometry, the vertical and horizontal force components at node_3 are supported by (3-4) and split among other members through the triangles. The maximum member force is likely in (3-4), taking nearly the full vertical component √(15^2+30^2)=33.54kN. Stress in (3-4)=Force/Area=33.54/1.759=19.07. stress-to-weight=19.07/8.29=2.3>0.75. Thus, increase area_id of (3-4) to '6' (7.037): stress=33.54/7.037=4.77, mass=2.5*7.037=17.59, total mass=~21.5. Now, stress-to-weight=4.77/21.5=0.22<0.75, constraints met. All other members remain area_id '1'. Final check: total mass: (recompute) 6.0*0.195 + 2.0*0.195 + 4.0*0.195 + 3.2*0.195 + 4.72*0.195 + 2.5*7.037 = 1.17+0.39+0.78+0.62+0.92+17.59=21.47<30.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "Design uses nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), (2,2.5) for efficient triangulated load distribution. All constraints satisfied: total mass ≈ 21.5 < 30, stress-to-weight ≈ 0.22 < 0.75, all members connected, and structure is closed. Area assignments minimize total mass and local overstress.
