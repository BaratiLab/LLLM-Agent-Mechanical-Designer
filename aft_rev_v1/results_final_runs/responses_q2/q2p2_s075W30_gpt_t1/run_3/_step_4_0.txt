    "preamble": "The structural optimization aims to produce a lightweight, constraint-satisfying 2D truss supporting the specified loads and boundary conditions. Current and prior designs violate the total mass constraint and have stress-to-weight ratios well below allowable. The main objective is a closed, minimum-mass truss with a stress-to-weight ratio <= 0.75 and total mass <= 30, while maintaining support connectivity and load application points.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Key objective is a closed, statically determinate (triangulated) truss using the given loaded/support nodes, possibly reusing geometry for efficiency. Past designs are massively overbuilt (mass > 64, constraint is 30), so downsizing members, reducing nodal heights, and more direct load transfer are priorities. Must not move or edit nodes with supports/loads.",
    
    "analysis": "The current design uses large-member areas and relatively high nodes (2.8 units vertically), yielding large lengths and thus excessive mass. Supports are at nodes 1 (pinned), 2 (roller), and 3 (roller), with a downward and leftward load at node 3, suggesting a cantilevered or arch-like geometry optimal for weight and stability. The historical solutions tried reducing geometry and member sizes but failed mass and stress-to-weight constraints, mostly due to suboptimal member selection and lack of compact, force-efficient triangulation. The best historic design masses ~10 (too high stress); a massive overbuilt one masses ~64. The key is to directly triangulate the space between the supports, using the minimum vertical height necessary, and favor slender, light members where possible.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: high nodes greatly increase diagonal lengths (and thus mass), and large area_ids (2-4+) were assigned to nearly all members regardless of need. Critical regions are between node 3 and its neighbors (where the load is applied), and between nodes 1-2 (the base). Insights: Use the lowest feasible triangles for load transfer, and only increase area_id where force/stress requires it—otherwise use smallest cross-section. Closed shape must connect all nodes without redundant or very heavy diagonals due to high y-positions.",
    
    "proposal": "Redesign the structure in minimal-mass form: retain nodes 1 (0.0,0.0), 2 (6.0,0.0), 3 (2.0,0.0) (all with supports/loads), and introduce a single apex node (node_4) as low as possible between nodes 1 and 2 (for best triangulation), e.g., at (3.0,1.5). Use a Warren truss form (basic triangle above), with only the minimum triangles. Size members directly based on load path: assign larger area_id only to members connecting to node_3. Avoid excess height: place the apex low to minimize member lengths. This will minimize mass and stress-to-weight ratio.",
    
    "reasoning": "By using a minimal-height triangle (Warren truss), we reduce all member lengths while maintaining a closed structure. Most members will experience moderate force; only those directly under the load at node_3 may see higher stress. Thus, areas 2 for diagonals and 1 for verticals/outer members should suffice, with a possible increase for the member directly from node_3 to the apex. The structure will be lighter, with all nodes connected, and is statically determinate. Base length is fixed (6 units), with only one small-height triangle (keep y < 2 to minimize mass). All constraints are enforced via tight area and location control.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume: steel or similar (areas per specs), unit density. Compute: lengths of each member; mass = sum(length × area); estimate maximum force using static equilibrium (pinned at node_1, rollers at node_2,3). The main load path will transfer load through member node_3-node_4 and node_4 to base. Assign area_ids for efficiency. For the lightly loaded base and top chords, area_id '1' (area=0.195), for diagonals under load, area_id '2' or '3' as needed. The position of node_4 must be low enough to minimize length but high enough to provide triangulation—(3.0,1.5) is a typical compromise.",
    
    "calculation": "Members: node_1-node_2 (base, L=6), node_1-node_4 (L=~3.35), node_2-node_4 (L=~3.35), node_3-node_4 (L=~1.80), node_1-node_3 (L=2.0), node_3-node_2 (L=4.0). Area_ids: Use '1' (0.195) for non-critical; '2' (0.782) for diagonals directly under load (node_3-node_4). \n\nMass calculation:\nBase: 6×0.195=1.17\nnode_1-node_4: 3.35×0.195≈0.65\nnode_2-node_4: same as above, 0.65\nnode_3-node_4: 1.80×0.782≈1.41\nnode_1-node_3: 2.0×0.195=0.39\nnode_3-node_2: 4.0×0.195=0.78\nSum ≈ 1.17+0.65+0.65+1.41+0.39+0.78 ≈ 5.05 (well under constraint).\nMax force in loaded diagonal (node_3-node_4): conservatively estimate ~33 (sum of force vector), so stress/weight ratio: 33/5.05 ≈ 6.5. But using larger area_id on the diagonal, stress is less. Assign area id '3' (area=1.759) to loaded diagonal: mass=1.8×1.759=3.166; adjust sum: 7.5; max stress drops: assuming force 33, stress on area 1.759 is ~18.7; ratio: 18.7/7.5≈2.5 (still over); increase area_id to '4' (3.128): mass=1.8×3.128=5.63, total mass ≈ 11.0, stress on this member: 33/3.128≈10.6; stress/weight=10.6/11.0≈0.96 (close to limit); area_id '5' (4.887): stress=33/4.887≈6.75, total mass about 13.6, ratio=0.496. Choose area_id '5' on main diagonal, rest with '1'. This yields all constraints satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "All node positions specified precisely, using only required nodes. All supports and load nodes are untouched, the geometry is minimal and closed (every node takes part in more than one triangle). Mass is well below constraint; stress-to-weight ratio < 0.75. Only the highly loaded diagonal is upsized, the rest use minimum area.",
