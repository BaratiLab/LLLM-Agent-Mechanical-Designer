    "preamble": "We are tasked with optimizing a 2D truss (minimize stress-to-weight ratio, mass ≤ 30, stress-to-weight ≤ 0.75) subject to 1 pinned, 2 roller supports, and a load at node_3. Previous and current designs violate stress-to-weight limits, suggesting excessive force in some members relative to their mass. Our aim: find a closed, triangulated, minimal-mass, constraint-satisfying truss using allowable area_ids and only adjusting free node positions and connections.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given supports at nodes 1/2/3, load at node_3, and mass/stress constraints, the structure must efficiently redirect force paths and avoid overloading any single member. Past attempts show stress concentration in member_1 (node_1-node_3), implying geometry or member sizing is unbalanced. Past high-mass solutions were always constraint-compliant but not weight-efficient.",
    
    "analysis": "Current design (iteration 7): stress-to-weight ratio 4.52 >> constraint (0.75). Failure mode: most stress focused in member_1, insufficient distribution, likely due to poor triangulation or geometry. Prior-best 'rank_1' design (stress-to-wt 0.34, mass 28.6) met constraints but was heavy due to excessive member areas/length. Compact, triangulated designs are less prone to overload; all-0.195 members are too weak, but all-1.0+ too heavy. Key: position intermediate nodes to minimize member_1 force via improved triangulation and direct load transfer. Strongest load path: nodes_1-3-2 should be reinforced, but with efficient geometry to support vertical/horizontal components.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Overstressing at node_3, likely from horizontal member. Prior mass-accepted design was compliant but inefficient. To resolve: (1) shrink nodal distances to minimize total member length, (2) ensure all triangles close. Slightly raise and offset interior nodes to distribute load from node_3, but don't place them too high (excessive length). Opt for a compact 'Warren' or 'Pratt' type truss. Use moderate area_ids (0, 1 or 2) for crucial members, 0 for less loaded ones.",
    
    "proposal": "Redesign to a five-node compact, symmetric closed truss. Reposition interior nodes to (a) ensure all triangles, (b) ensure efficient force flow from node_3 downward to supports, and (c) keep member lengths minimal. Use area_id '1' (A=0.195) for lightly loaded horizontal/tie members, area_id '2' (A=0.782) for diagonals and direct force paths near node_3. Avoid excessive use of high-area members. All nodes will be linked in triangles, and direct paths from node_3 to each support will exist.",
    
    "reasoning": "Symmetric triangulated layout best avoids stress concentration—each main node (support or loaded) is either a triangle vertex or closely tied to such. Keeping members short reduces mass; using higher area near loaded zone spreads load over more steel. The two key diagonals to node_3 take most of the load, so upsize those only. The outer chord (nodes 1-2) can be light, others moderate as justified by geometry.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Key assumptions: Load at node_3 splits into x/y resolved via truss; supports are sufficient. Members closest to node_3 (to nodes 1/2/4) bear most load. Set nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0) fixed by supports. Choose node_4 (load transfer, up), node_5 (balance geometry, right of node_3, up). Try node_4 at (2.3,1.5) and node_5 at (4.1,1.1). All triangles: (1-4-3), (4-3-5), (5-3-2), (4-5-2), (1-3-2). Assign member areas: tie/brace at '1', main diagonals at '2', chords at '1'. Check member lengths, total mass, estimated forces.",
    
    "calculation": "Estimated member lengths (units), assign area_ids: \n- member_1: node_1-node_3 (2.0 units), area_id 1 (0.195)\n- member_2: node_3-node_2 (4.0 units), area_id 1\n- member_3: node_1-node_4 (~2.77), area_id 1\n- member_4: node_4-node_3 (~1.58), area_id 2 (primary load path)\n- member_5: node_4-node_5 (~1.93), area_id 1\n- member_6: node_5-node_3 (~2.21), area_id 2 (primary load path)\n- member_7: node_5-node_2 (~2.19), area_id 1\n- member_8: node_4-node_2 (~3.97), area_id 1\nSum mass ≈ Σ(length × area):\n(2.0+4.0+2.77+1.93+2.19+3.97)*0.195 + (1.58+2.21)*0.782 \n= (16.86)*0.195 + (3.79)*0.782 ≈ 3.29 + 2.96 ≈ 6.25 < 30 (passes). Now, approximate that main load path members (area_id 2) will not be overstressed: (max estimated member force = ~12 units, mass=6.25) → stress-to-wt ≈ 12/6.25 = 1.92, but recall loads are split on at least two diagonals—split to ~6 units per heavy member, so stress-to-wt ratio ≈ 6/6.25 = 0.96. Still marginally high; adding a bit more area to those two main diagonals (area_id '3' = 1.759). Update mass: (1.58+2.21)*1.759 ≈ 6.67, total mass ≈ 3.29+6.67=9.96. Now, stress-to-wt ≈ 6/9.96=0.60 < 0.75; passes.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Final checks: Total mass ≈ 10 < 30, member stress spread (max stress ~6->7, less than area × safety factors), all nodes connected, fully triangulated structure. Modest raising of node_4/node_5 for compact triangles, both to minimize member length and distribute force. Area choices are efficient. Final coordinates will use precise float values as below.",
