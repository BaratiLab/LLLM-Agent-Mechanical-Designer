The objective is to redesign to minimize stress-to-weight ratio below 0.5 while keeping total mass under 30, ensuring all nodes are connected and unchanged supports and loaded nodes preserved.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "The load is concentrated at node_3 with components (-15, -30) causing high compressive stress in member_1 and others. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2, node_3 (rollers) fix boundary conditions. Current structure is complex with inefficient load paths, high mass in member_2 (6.87). The best historic design shows even worse stress-to-weight ratios, so no immediate reuse.",\n\n    "analysis": "The load applied at node_3 generates large compressive stress in member_1 (\'node_1\'-\'node_3\') with area \'2\' (0.782). The stress-to-weight ratio ~0.93 exceeds 0.5 limit. Member_2 is very heavy (area \'3\'=1.759). The structure has multiple redundant members but poor triangulation and uneven load transfer causing stress concentration. The constrained nodes must remain fixed, so node_3 lies on 2.00,0.00. Node_5 inside the structure adds complexity. Member lengths and areas cause total mass 16.5794, under limit but with inefficient area allocation. Two rollers at different nodes (node_2 and node_3) may reduce stiffness. Using a triangular truss with well-chosen nodes reduces stress and weight.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "The current heavy diagonal member_2 and multiple small members around node_5 create high stress gradients. The stress concentration in member_1 suggests poor load path distribution. The load acts downward-left, so members should direct force efficiently from node_3 to supports at node_1 and node_2. Removing node_5 and reducing intermediate nodes may help. Using a simpler triangular geometry with members sized properly and well triangulated supports would minimize stress and mass while satisfying constraints.",\n\n    "proposal": "Propose to remove node_5 to simplify the topology and form a triangular closed truss with nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6.0,0.0), node_3 (2.0,0.0), and reposition node_4 from (2.5,3.0) to (3.0,4.0) to better distribute load. Connect members as a closed triangle among node_1, node_2, node_4 plus diagonals to node_3 to create a stable truss. Assign moderate area \'1\' or \'2\' to members to keep mass low but ensure stress below limits. Maintain supports and load nodes fixed.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Triangulation is key to stable trusses. A four-node truss with node_4 at (3.0,4.0) introduces a strong vertical component for load carrying. Member_1 (\'node_1\'-\'node_3\') area reduced to \'1\'(0.195) to reduce mass since load is redistributed via node_4. Members connecting node_4 to nodes 1, 2, 3 are sized to carry load with area \'2\' (0.782). Member_7 (node_2-node_3) retained with area \'1\' (0.195) for shear force transfer. Closed loop ensures no isolated nodes. The simplification reduces mass and stress.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Uniform axial stress in members; conservative stress estimate could use load divided by cross-sectional area; mass is sum of (member length x area factor). Calculate member lengths from node distances. Estimate member forces from static equilibrium and distribute load based on geometry. Select member area so that max stress <= 0.5 * total weight (area chosen to satisfy both mass and stress constraints). Check force balances at nodes 3 and 4. Keep roller supports to allow horizontal or vertical displacement as per given condition.",\n\n    "calculation": "Node distances: \\n- \'node_1\'-\'node_3\': 2.0 m, \\n- \'node_1\'-\'node_4\': sqrt((3.0-0)^2+(4.0-0)^2) = 5.0 m,\\n- \'node_2\'-\'node_4\': sqrt((3.0-6)^2+4^2) = 5.0 m,\\n- \'node_3\'-\'node_4\': sqrt((3.0-2)^2+(4-0)^2) = ~4.12 m,\\n- \'node_2\'-\'node_3\': 4.0 m.\\n\\nMember areas assigned: \'member_1\' area \'1\' (0.195), \'member_2\', \'member_3\', \'member_4\' area \'2\' (0.782), \'member_5\' area \'1\'(0.195).\\n\\nEstimated total mass = sum(length x area factor):\\n= (2.0*0.195) + (5.0*0.782)*3 + (4.0*0.195) + (4.12*0.782)\\n= 0.39 + 11.73 + 0.78 + 3.22 = ~16.11 under 30.\\n\\nEstimated max stress-to-weight ratio computed by limiting maximum assumed member force to below 0.5 * total mass = 0.5 * 16.11 = 8.06 units.
