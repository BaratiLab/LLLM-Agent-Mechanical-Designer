Objective is to design a closed, fully connected truss with minimal mass and controlled stress.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes at (0,0), (6,0), and (2,0). Load at node_3 (-15, -30) applies a downward-left force. Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 and node_3. Initial truss is a line with nodes, so no closed loops yet. Constraints: stress/weight <=0.5, mass <=30. Area choices from discrete set. Need to create a closed truss with possibly new node(s).",\n\n    "analysis": "Original nodes are colinear on x-axis, no vertical height for triangulation. With the load acting downward-left at node_3 (2,0), member forces in a line will be inefficient, causing high stresses. No vertical or diagonal members currently exist to transfer load effectively. Adding a new node above line creates triangles, improving stiffness and reducing stress. Supports at node_1 fixed (pinned) and node_2 rollers imply horizontal displacement at node_2 is free. Load at node_3 is downward and left, so a diagonal member from node_3 to a new elevated node and from node_1 to the same node can triangulate and form efficient load path. This reduces stress in horizontal members. Also, the structure will be closed with 4 nodes and 4 or 5 members as a triangular frame plus base.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a new node around (3.5, 4.0) above base line will form two triangles (node_1, node_2, new_node) and (node_1, node_3, new_node). This distributes load stresses from node_3 vertically through diagonal members and reduces the max stress. Choosing moderate to low area members on base line to save mass and higher area for diagonal members bearing tension/compression from load. This arrangement is likely mass efficient and meets constraints.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Use triangulation for closed truss. Place node_4 at (3.5,4.0) forming two triangles. Members: node_1-node_2, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_1 (base triangle), and node_1-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_2 (forming upper chords). The load path is: node_3 load transfers up to node_4 and then spreads to supports. Use smallest effective area (area_id \'1\' = 0.195) in base members since mainly compression/tension in line, medium areas (area_id \'3\' =1.759) for diagonals. Verify mass and stress-to-weight. The closed shape improves stiffness and load distribution.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: steel density uniform, member length mass proportional to length × area.

Assume estimated max axial force <= 15*1.5=22.5 (input load magnitude approx). Stress = force / area. Max stress occurs in diagonals with area 1.759, max axial force assumed 20.
