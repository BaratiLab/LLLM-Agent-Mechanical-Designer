Objective to design a closed truss means adding members and possibly nodes to achieve triangulation with minimal mass and stress. Given limited nodes, likely need a new node above to create triangles for lateral stiffness and direct load paths in tension/compression.",\n\n    "analysis": "With horizontal nodes colinear, the structure without an elevated node is a simple line and thus not stable against vertical loads. The load is downward and leftward at node_3 but node_3 is roller with vertical and horizontal freedom in respective directions (roller implies support in one direction - assuming roller at node_2 and node_3 only restrict vertical movement). To maintain stability and resist load, add a node above (say node_4) to triangulate structure forming two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_3, node_2, node_4). Members from node_4 to node_1, node_2, and node_3 will distribute load efficiently. This creates direct load paths in truss members, reducing bending. Member areas can be assigned by estimated tension or compression forces based on statics solution. The top node height affects member lengths and angles and thus affects stress and mass. Choose node_4 y to be positive, approx 3.0 for a balanced height across span. Stress calculated from axial force / area; mass proportional to length × area. Load path has load at node_3; force transfer through diagonals to supports node_1 and node_2. Closed structure confirmed with four nodes connected by triangulation. Mass and max stress checked to ensure constraints.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation principle critical to minimize bending and maximize axial member efficiency. Balanced triangles distribute forces symmetrically and minimize max stress. Constraining mass to <=30 means moderate cross-sectional areas needed. The lowest area id (0:\'1.0\') offers largest area but heavier mass, so selectively assign large areas to members with highest forces, small areas to others. This tradeoff is key. Node coordinates must be precise floats. Support conditions imply node_1 fully fixed, node_2 and node_3 roller supports: node_2 roller vertical, node_3 roller horizontal, or vice versa. For assumptions, take node_2 roller vertical (no horizontal fix), node_3 roller vertical (no horizontal fix). This implies the design must carry horizontal load via members from node_3 and node_4 carefully.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at midpoint between node_1 and node_2 in x, elevated in y to create symmetric triangles. Specifically node_4 at (3.0, 3.0). Members: (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), (node_1-node_4), (node_4-node_2), (node_4-node_3). This creates two triangles (node_1,node_3,node_4) and (node_3,node_2,node_4) - closed system. Assign areas: use area \'6\' (7.037) for diagonals supporting main load, area \'2\'(0.782) for horizontal members, balancing stress/mass. This keeps mass ~<30, stress low. Load can be resolved by member axial forces directed along member axes; assigning larger areas where forces are higher. The truss is statically determinate. Cross-sectional selection based on expected tension/compression estimated from statics equilibrium: bigger area on tension diagonals, smaller on compression or lesser loaded members.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Each member force axial only, linear elastic. Calculate member length via distance formula. Force balance at node_3: sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0 using member unit vectors and unknown axial member forces, plus external load (-15, -30). Solve for axial forces in members node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_4. Similar at node_4 for members connecting node_1, node_2, node_3. Calculate stress=force/area; weight=sum(length×area). Stress-to-weight=max(abs(stress))/total_weight. Validate <=0.5. Iterate area sizes if necessary.",\n\n    "calculation": "Coordinates: node_1(0.0,0.0), node_2(6.0,0.0), node_3(2.0,0.0), node_4(3.0,3.0).

Force equilibrium at node_3 leads to axial forces roughly: F_n1n3=17.5 tension, F_n3n2=5.0 compression, F_n3n4=33.5 tension (approx). Max axial force ~33.5. Stress_max = 33.5 / 7.037 ≈4.76. Total weight = sum(length×area) = ~ (2×0.782)+(4×0.782)+(3.6056×7.037)*3 ≈ 1.564+3.128+76.13= approx 80.8, which is over limit. Need to reduce areas or adjust. Reduce diagonals to area \'4\'=3.128 and maintain horizontals at 0.782. New weight ~ (2*0.782)+(4*0.782)+(3.6056*3.128)*3=1.56+3.13+33.87=38.5 still >30. Reduce horizontal members to 0.195 area. Weight ~ (2*0.195)+(4*0.195)+(3*3.128*3.6056)=0.39+0.78+33.9=35.1, still high. Try diagonal areas at \'2\'=0.782, horizontals at 0.195.

Try \'4\'=3.128 diagonal areas. Weight = 1.17 + (3*3.128*3.6056) = 1.17 +33.87= 35 over 30 no good. Try \'2\' = 0.782 diagonal areas, horizontal \'1\' = 0.195. Max stress is high. Alternative: reduce node_4 height to reduce member length and forces. Try y=1.5 for node_4. Distances: n1-n4=3.354, n4-n2=3.354, n3-n4=1.803. Forces scale down approx by half; max force ~17; max stress ~17/0.782=21.7. Weight ~ (2*0.195)+(4*0.195)+(1.803*0.782) * 3 = 0.39+0.78+4.23=5.4. Stress to weight = 21.7/5.4=4 high. Increase diagonal areas to 3.128. Weight = 1.17 + (3*3.128*1.803)=1.17 +16.91=18.08. Max stress 17/3.128=5.44 stress/weight = 5.44/18.08=0.30 < 0.5 good. Mass <30 good.
