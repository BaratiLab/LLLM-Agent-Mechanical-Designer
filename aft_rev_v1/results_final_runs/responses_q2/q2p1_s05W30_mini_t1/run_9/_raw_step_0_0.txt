Load at node_3 downward-left. Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 and node_3 (roller). Constraints stress/weight ≤ 0.5, total mass ≤ 30. Need a closed truss with all nodes connected.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current colinear nodes form a zero-area shape, no rigidity. Under load at node_3, lateral and vertical reactions must be supported. To achieve a stable, closed truss, a triangulated shape is ideal. Adding nodes above or below the x-axis will create triangles, redistribute forces efficiently, reducing bending and high stress. Supports: pinned at node_1 allows vertical and horizontal reaction, roller allows only vertical reaction at node_2, roller at node_3 restricts horizontal movement. The load at node_3 is (-15 N, -30 N) (assuming direction means force vector components). Members must be chosen with cross-section areas from given options to keep mass ≤30 and stress-to-weight ratio ≤0.5.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "The key to optimization is triangulation for stiffness and load transfer. The minimal closed polygon is a triangle. Triangulate by adding a node above the line between node_1 and node_2. This node can be placed at roughly (3,3.5) to ensure good geometry and distribute loads. Members connect all nodes to form triangles. Use bigger area members in compression/tension paths carrying most load and smaller area for lighter members to save mass.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Place a new node (node_4) at (3.00, 3.50) forming triangles: (node_1, node_4, node_3) and (node_4, node_3, node_2).
