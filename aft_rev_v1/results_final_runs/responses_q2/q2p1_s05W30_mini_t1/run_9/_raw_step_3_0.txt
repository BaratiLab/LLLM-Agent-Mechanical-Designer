The objective is to redesign an optimal closed 2D truss with fixed support and load nodes, reducing max stress and total mass to satisfy constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The load is at node_3 with force (-15, -30). Supports are fixed at node_1 (pinned) and roller supports at nodes 2 and 3 on the ground line. Current nodes mostly lie on the X-axis except node_4 elevated. Current max stress-to-weight ratio is 0.4201 with mass 33.7, violating mass ≤ 30. Stress concentration is very high at member_4 connected to node_1 and node_3, indicating inefficient load path.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Load is vertical and lateral down-left at node_3. Node_1 is pinned, node_2 and node_3 are rollers limiting horizontal and vertical displacements respectively. The load tries to pull and push between node_3, node_1, and node_4. The current truss uses heavily sized members (area_id \'4\') at the top chords. The highest stress is negative (compression) on member_4 connecting node_1 and node_3, indicating this member is overloaded. The total mass exceeds 30 due to large areas and member lengths. History shows raising node_4 height and reducing some areas helps but max stress exceeded limits. The triangular arrangement lacks sufficient triangulation and stiffness near node_3 load. Member_3 is stressed in tension but relatively low area (2). There is no member directly connecting node_1 to node_2 horizontally, missing a chord, reducing stability.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: The high compression on member_4 is critical; changing topology or member sizing is needed. The horizontal base chord (node_1-node_2) is missing; this chord can reduce bending in top chords. Raising node_4 too high causes high stresses. Using smaller areas on main tension members and adding diagonal members can improve load distribution. Adding node_5 could help but not allowed to add nodes since it\'s unspecified. Optimal design must keep node_1,2,3 on ground. The load at node_3 requires direct triangulation with node_4 and node_1 for optimal load transfer.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss to add the base chord between node_1 and node_2 to form a closed triangular base, position node_4 at moderate height to optimize compression/tension balance, and keep all nodes connected. Update member areas to reduce mass, using smaller areas at low stress members. Use a fully triangulated layout with members: (1-4), (4-2), (1-3), (3-2), (4-3), and add base chord (1-2) for stability. Keep node coordinates fixed for nodes 1, 2, 3 due to supports/loads and position node_4 higher than current 3.0 but less than 3.5 to reduce top chord stress.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation provides structural stability under combined vertical and horizontal loads. Introducing the base chord (node_1-node_2) closes the truss polygon and shares load between supports. Lowering the height of node_4 much below 3 reduces stiffness; above 3.2 still provides clearance but reduces apex compressive stress. Using lower area sections on members with low stress balances mass and strength. Members under highest stress (1-3) and (3-4) sized higher. Member (1-2) chord sized moderate to reduce bending.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume node_1(0.00,0.00), node_2(6.00,0.00), node_3(2.00,0.00) fixed. Set node_4 to (3.20, 3.20). Member lengths calculated by Euclidean distance. Member areas chosen from given: use \'4\' (3.128) for main load members, \'2\' (0.782) for base chord and low stress members. Calculate mass = sum(length*area). Estimate internal forces assuming typical load path: members connected to load carry ±15-30 load components shared; use approximate method.
