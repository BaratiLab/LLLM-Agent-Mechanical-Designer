Load applied at node_3 (2,0) downward-left (-15 N at -30°). Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 and node_3. Goal: closed truss, so must add at least one node for triangulation. Constraints on max stress-to-weight ratio ≤0.5 and mass ≤30 using given discrete area_ids.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Load applied is primarily downward-left, inducing tension/compression in members connecting node_3. Support at node_1 is pinned (restrains vertical and horizontal), node_2 and node_3 are rollers (only vertical). The base nodes lie on x-axis; node_3 also on x-axis but loaded. To resist lateral load and keep structure closed with minimal stress, triangulation is key. Members along the x-axis carry compression/tension, vertical or diagonal members handle lateral load transfer. Without additional node, structure is open and poorly constrained. Adding one node above node_3 and node_2 to form triangle optimizes load paths and reduces bending.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation pattern ensures closed geometry with minimal members. Adding node_4 above node_3 and node_2 creates two triangles sharing base between node_2 and node_3. This approach efficiently directs load to pinned and roller supports, reducing member stress. Use smallest possible area for less weight unless stress demands larger area. Using area_id \'1\' (0.195) for light members, adjust area of critical tension/compression members higher if needed. Members: base (node_1-node_2), (node_2-node_3), new diagonals (node_2-node_4), (node_3-node_4), and vertical (node_4-node_1) or similar for triangulation.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "To form closed truss, add node_4 at midpoint between node_2 and node_3 but above the baseline. This yields two triangles: (node_1, node_2, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4). Node_4 coordinates chosen to balance span length and vertical height to optimize stress and mass. Area selections comply with discrete available area_ids, using higher area for longer or high load members and small for tension ties. Members selected to achieve closed loop including all nodes. This maximizes load path efficiency and reduces max member stress, meeting the ratio ≤0.5.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear axial forces, uniform cross-section per member area_id, weight proportional to length × area.
