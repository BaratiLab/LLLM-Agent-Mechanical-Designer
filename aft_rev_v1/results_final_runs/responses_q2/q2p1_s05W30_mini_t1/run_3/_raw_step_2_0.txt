The goal is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio (currently 0.4896) while satisfying structural constraints and boundary conditions.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "The current structure has 4 nodes with 3 supports (node_1 pinned, node_2 and node_3 rollers) and a load at node_3. Members connect nodes forming a closed quadrilateral with diagonals. Current mass is 14.8887 with max stress 7.29. Constraints require stress/weight ≤ 0.5 and total mass ≤ 30.",\n  "analysis": "The current max stress-to-weight ratio 0.4896 is just below the constraint 0.5. The history shows a previously ranked better design (rank_1) with higher mass (21.0393) but much lower stress-to-weight ratio (0.1963). The rank_1 structure used thicker members (area_id \'4\') on bottom chords and thinner top chords. However, this mass is higher than current. The bottom chord members (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2) in the current design show high stresses, suggesting these members bear large loads from node_3\'s force. The top chord (node_1-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_2-node_4) members carry less stress but current member areas may be suboptimal. The current design\'s node_4 is at (2.75,3.25) - slightly unbalanced vertically and horizontally. Optimal triangulation with better load paths and member sizing could improve stress distribution and weight.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "A promising approach is to increase bottom chord member areas slightly to reduce max stress while compensating mass in the top chord by using thinner members and adjusting node_4 upward and slightly right to balance compression and tension members. The load at node_3 is downward-left (-15,-30), so moving node_4 more above node_3 could reduce bending effects. A more symmetric and equilateral triangle form often improves load paths and reduces peak stresses.",\n  "proposal": "We adopt the rank_1 structure node placement as a starting point for node_4 at (3.0, 3.0), keep supports fixed, update bottom chord members to area_id \'4\' to reduce stress, and reduce top chord members to area_id \'1\' where possible. This should reduce stress-to-weight ratio substantially while keeping mass under 30.",\n  "reasoning": "Bottom chord members at node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2 bear the largest load; thicker cross-section reduces stress. The top chords carry less load and can be thinner for weight saving. Node_4 reposition at (3.0, 3.0) optimizes geometry to balance forces. This design uses symmetry, triangulation, and member area optimization to optimize load paths and mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: \\nnode_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (3,3)\\nMembers:\\nm1: n1-n3 length=2.0\\nm2: n3-n2 length=4.0\\nm3: n1-n4 length=√(3^2+0^2)=3.0\\nm4: n3-n4 length=√((3-2)^2+(3-0)^2)=√(1+9)=3.162\\nm5: n2-n4 length=√((6-3)^2+(0-3)^2)=√(9+9)=4.243\\nMass calculation using areas:\\narea_ids {\'1\':0.195, \'4\':3.128}\\nm1,m2 area_id \'4\' mass=length*3.128\\nm3,m4,m5 area_id \'1\' mass=length*0.195\\nCalculate total mass and estimate stresses based on reduced max stress seen in rank_1 history.
