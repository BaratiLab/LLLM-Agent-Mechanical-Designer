Objective is to minimize max(abs(stress))/total_weight while respecting stress-weight ratio ≤0.5 and mass ≤30. Design a closed structure including all nodes with possible added nodes if needed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given 3 nodes aligned mostly on x-axis with one load at node_3 down-leftward. Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 + node_3 rollers. Load magnitude is -15 at 30° downward-left. Constraints require closed structure; min stress-to-weight and mass ≤30. Use area_id from discrete set. Initially, triangle formed only by node_1, node_2, node_3 is collinear, so truss not stable or closed in 2D properly. Need additional nodes for stability.",\n\n    "analysis": "Nodes node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0) lie on x-axis; load at node_3 directs diagonally bottom-left, supports constrain vertical and horizontal. Current setup collinear nodes → no stable 2D truss; no triangulation → infinite mechanisms, unstable. Load path inefficient, direct compression/tension on line risky. To ensure closure and stability, must introduce at least one node above nodes to form triangles (primary principle). Load at node_3 imposes bending forces; truss should redirect these via diagonal members. Failure modes include buckling/tension failure in members due to long spans. Mass constraint (≤30) limits cross-section size/length sum. Stress-to-weight requires stiffness preferably by triangulated geometry. Best to add one node above between node_1 and node_3 or node_3 and node_2 to form multiple triangles for load distribution and stiffness.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Noting line of nodes too flat, adding node_4 at approx mid-height above with x ~3-4 to create two main triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_3, node_2, node_4). Load transferred via node_3 to node_4, then distributed to supports. Using areas to balance stiffness and mass: heavier areas on primary compression/tension members, light areas on diagonals to reduce weight. Triangulated closed structure achieved, stability ensured. Optimum member areas adjusted with discrete set based on force magnitude estimation.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (3.0, 3.0) forming two triangles: left triangle (node_1, node_3, node_4) and right triangle (node_3, node_2, node_4). This creates 5 members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_2-node_4. This configuration is statically determinate and stable. Assign areas: larger sections for longest or high force members (bases), moderate for vertical/diagonal chords. Area IDs 3 or 4 (1.759 or 3.128) for primary members, smaller for diagonals. This design allows distributed load path and reduced max stress-to-weight ratio and mass within constraints.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members behave as axial bars; load split by static equilibrium. Calculate lengths via distance formula. Calculate axial forces via method of joints at node_3, node_4. Area chosen inversely proportional to peak axial force to balance stress. Weight = sum(length*area). Stress proportional to force/area, max |stress|/weight ≤ 0.5. Use trigonometry for angles and forces. Ignore buckling, assume linear elastic. Set areas from discrete choices prioritizing constraint adherence.",\n\n    "calculation": "Coordinates: node_4 at (3.0, 3.0). Member lengths: l_13=2.0, l_32=4.0, l_14=3.6056, l_34=3.1623, l_24=3.6056. Estimate forces from equilibrium: vertical and horizontal at node_3 with load (-15, -30°) = Fx=-12.99 N, Fy=-7.5 N approx. Forces resolve into members from node_3. Assign area_id \'4\' (3.128) to members node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2 (primary span), area_id \'3\' (1.759) to vertical-like and diagonals. Calculate masses: sum member length × area. Mass ~ (2.0*3.128)+(4.0*3.128)+(3.6056*1.759)+(3.1623*1.759)+(3.6056*1.759) ≈ 6.256 + 12.512 + 6.343 + 5.562 + 6.343 = 36.9 too high. Reduce area of diagonals to \'1\' (0.195) to reduce mass: new mass ≈ 6.256 + 12.512 + 0.7 + 0.62 + 0.7 = 20.8 mass good. Check max stress ≈ max axial force / min area; principal members sized accordingly assure max stress/weight ≤0.5.
