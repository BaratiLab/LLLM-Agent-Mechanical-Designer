Objective is to further reduce this ratio by improving member sizing and member connectivity while maintaining supports and load conditions.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given load at node_3 downward-left, supports pinned at node_1 and rollers at nodes 2 and 3, nodes 1, 2, 3 fixed positions. Current design uses varied area sizes 1,2,3. Constraints: stress-to-weight <=0.5 and total mass <=30 are met. Current mass ~19.7 with max stress 7.28 MPa.",\n    "analysis": "Load is concentrated at node_3 downward-left. Node_1 pinned anchors structure, nodes_2 and 3 rollers stabilize horizontal reactions. Members form a closed loop: nodes 1-3-2 with triangle to nodes 4 and 5 forming internal bracing. Largest stress in member_1 (node_1 to node_3) in tension/compression (-7.28). Current member_1 area 3 (1.759). Members closer to load carry higher stress; lighter areas towards stable nodes. History shows attempts with lighter areas but higher stress-to-weight ratio or constraint violations. Current design well balanced with moderate mass and stress distribution.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Member 1 and 2 are largest areas; member 1 is critical. Member 7 (node_5 to node_3) has smallest area (1). Node_5 provides internal bracing but may be slightly repositioned to optimize force flow and reduce member lengths. Node_4 height at 3.5m gives a good vertical support. Minor repositioning of these intermediate nodes could help reduce high-stress members lengths or force concentrations. Could consider increasing member_7 area slightly for load path or minor re-distribution of areas. The load vector points left-down at node_3, adjacent members should be optimized accordingly.",\n    "proposal": "Keep node_1,2,3 fixed for support and load conditions. Slightly raise node_5 from (4.0,2.0) to (4.2,2.3) to improve triangulation and reduce stress in member_5 and member_7. Keep node_4 fixed at (2.0,3.5) for stability. Upgrade member_7 area from 1 to 2 to better share forces at node_3. Reduce member_2 area from 3 to 2 to reduce weight where stress very low. Keep member_1 area 3 as it carries highest stress. Maintain other members as is. This modification reduces maximum stress and total mass slightly, improving ratio while satisfying constraints.",\n    "reasoning": "Triangulation is effective; raising node_5 improves angle and force path, increasing smaller area members to 2 improves strength without large weight penalty. Reducing member_2 area leverages low stress there to save mass. Member_1 must remain large due to high stress. Minor node repositioning respects supports and load nodes fixed. Force balance will reduce peak stress and improve weight efficiency.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and areas to estimate mass: length = Euclidean distance between nodes; mass = length * area coefficient. Estimate force distribution assuming linear elastic truss. Max stress scales with force/area; by increasing area or improving geometry, max stress reduces. Member_7 area increased to 2 (0.782) from 1 (0.195), mass doubles but stress share reduces. Member_2 area lowered from 3 (1.759) to 2 (0.782) reduces mass.
