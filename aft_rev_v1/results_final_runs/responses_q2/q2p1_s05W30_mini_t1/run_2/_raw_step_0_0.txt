The goal is to create a closed, triangulated truss that evenly distributes forces. Constraints enforce max stress-to-weight <= 0.5 and total mass <= 30 with discrete area selections.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Nodes: node_1 (0,0, pinned fixed), node_2 (6,0, roller), node_3 (2,0, roller) with load (-15 N at 30° below horizontal). Given all nodes lie on x-axis, forming a closed 2D truss requires additional nodes above the baseline to form triangular members. Direct triangle formation between existing colinear nodes is infeasible. Without vertical elements, load path is pure axial, but the force direction at node_3 requires shear/moment resistance which a colinear truss cannot provide efficiently. Likely high stresses if only baseline members used. Introducing one node at apex will create a triangle, improving force distribution and minimizing bending. Supports imply horizontal reaction at node_1 and vertical at node_2 plus pinned node_1 restricts rotation and translation. Failure candidates: high tensile/compressive stress in baseline members or apex members. Mass constraints require careful area selection — larger areas increase mass but reduce stress. Balancing these is key.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress, the truss must be triangulated. A single apex node vertically above or slightly offset from node_3 creates two triangles: node_1–apex–node_3 and node_3–apex–node_2. This distributes load efficiently with axial forces. Area assignments need to be minimal but sufficient, considering force magnitudes and member length. Members along the baseline are shorter, likely carry compression; apex members longer and carry tension. Loading from node_3 inclined down-left necessitates members capable of resolving vertical and horizontal components. The key insight is adding one apex node approximately above node_3 simplifies design while meeting constraints.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Place one new node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) forming an isosceles triangle with node_1 and node_2 at base y=0. This apex location balances vertical and horizontal load components effectively over manageable member lengths. Members: node_1–node_4, node_4–node_2, node_1–node_3, node_3–node_2, and node_3–node_4 ensure closed topology with triangulation. Areas assigned from available IDs minimizing mass while keeping stress <= limits. Larger area for members near load and support (node_3–node_4), smaller areas for base members. This design expected to have max stress-to-weight <= 0.5 and total mass <= 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear static equilibrium, members only axial force.
