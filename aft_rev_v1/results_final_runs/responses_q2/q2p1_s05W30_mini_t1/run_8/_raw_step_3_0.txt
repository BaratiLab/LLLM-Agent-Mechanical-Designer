The objective is to generate a fully connected, closed 2D truss with improved load distribution and reduced stress-to-weight ratio within given mass constraints, keeping fixities and loaded nodes unchanged.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Structure must include pinned (node_1) and roller supports (node_2 and node_3), with load applied at node_3 downward and left (-15, -30). Current max stress is high notably in member_1 (node_1-node_3). History shows heavier mass designs with lower stress but not structurally optimal or balanced. Target is a balanced minimal mass truss with stress-to-weight <= 0.5 and total mass <= 30.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current failure is due to excessive compressive stress in the short member_1 (node_1-node_3) which is heavily loaded by the force at node_3 and reaction from supports. Members connecting to node_5 are heavy and high stress. The current node layout places node_3 on the base line unhelpfully, limiting geometry for effective load paths. History with relocated nodes (constraint_not_met_1) generated larger mass and still constraints issues, indicating poor load triangulation. Triangular forms and good bracing around loaded node_3 and intermediate nodes are needed. The use of larger area members near supports and load helps reduce stress but adds mass. We seek a triangular closed truss with more evenly distributed load paths and moderate member sizes.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Insight: The load at node_3 must be efficiently transferred to pinned node_1 and roller node_2. Positioning nodes above the base allows for effective triangulation. Member_1 length and area critically affect stress-to-weight ratio. Reducing length or increasing area of this member helps. Adding diagonal members connecting upper nodes to supports ensures bracing and load transfer. Mass is reduced by using smaller areas for longer members and larger areas near load and supports.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign node_4 and node_5 positions higher and spaced to form a compact triangular bracing around node_3 and node_2. Maintain node_3 at (2.00, 0.00), node_1 (0.00, 0.00), node_2 (6.00, 0.00) fixed. Connect nodes to form a closed truss of triangles: node_1-node_4-node_3, node_3-node_5-node_2, node_4-node_5-node_2. Assign larger areas to members adjacent to high load and supports (area \'5\' and \'4\'), smaller area members on longer chords (area \'1\' or \'2\') to control mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Placing node_4 at (1.9, 2.7) and node_5 at (4.2, 3.3) supports load distribution into triangles. Using a larger area (4.887, \'5\') for short members from node_1 to node_4 and node_5 to node_2 reduces stress. Medium area (\'4\' = 3.128) for key diagonals from node_4 and node_5 to node_3 and node_2. Short compression member from node_1 to node_3 gets area \'3\' (1.759) to moderate stress. This supplies balanced load paths to both supports and reduces max stress.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance. Approximate member mass = length Ã— area. Sum masses must be under 30. Estimate stress proportional to load over cross-sectional area and member length. Max stress-to-weight ratio = max stress / total mass. Check triangulation closure (all nodes connected with no isolated nodes). Use 7 members to form closed loops: node_1-node_3, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_4-node_5, node_2-node_3. Set areas as per reasoning.
