Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) suggest horizontal reactions at node_1 and vertical at node_2. Goal: closed truss connecting all nodes, likely adding at least one new node for triangulation to reduce stress and improve load path.",\n\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 is (-15, -30) N vector (leftwards and downwards). Supports provide vertical/horizontal reaction to maintain equilibrium. With only a linear chain of nodes (0,0), (2,0), (6,0), the truss is unstable and statically indeterminate for vertical loads. A closed triangulated structure is required to distribute stresses effectively. Adding a node above the baseline between node_2 and node_3 would allow diagonal members distributing load, reducing bending and member stress. Minimizing member areas reduces weight. The highest stress will be in diagonals opposing the load direction. ",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "To achieve closure and stability, at least one new node off the line, forming triangles with existing nodes is needed. Positioning the new node near the centroid of nodes_2 and _3 with higher y coordinate improves load transfer. With 4 nodes, we form triangle members (1-3-4) and (2-3-4) for good triangulation. Using small area IDs on low-force tension members and larger areas on compression members optimizes mass and stress.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at roughly (4.00, 3.00) to create two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4).
