The objective is to generate a new closed truss structure satisfying all constraints with optimized stress-to-weight ratio, keeping nodes with supports and loads fixed.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given load at node_3 is (-15.0, -30.0). Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller, node_3 roller. Nodes node_1, node_2, node_3 are fixed horizontally along base line, node_4 is elevated. Current design uses 5 members creating a trapezoidal frame with diagonals but fails stress/weight ratio constraint.",\n  "analysis": "Constraint 1 (stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 0.5) is violated by current design due to member_1 highly stressed (-7.0132). Member areas are moderate, but stress concentration suggests insufficient load path redistribution or inefficient member sizing. The history shows a structure with node_4 moved slightly and member areas adjusted (rank_1) that reduces stress-to-weight ratio to 0.2237 but increases mass beyond 29, breaching mass constraint. The current structure is lighter but overstressed. Load applied at node_3 downward and leftward requires effective triangulation and load distribution towards supports. The current structure is a quadrilateral with two diagonals but unequal node heights and inconsistent member sizing result in stress concentration. A closed triangular-truss pattern with efficient area sizing and slight repositioning of node_4 can improve performance. Node_3 must not move due to load and support constraints, but node_4 can be adjusted to improve stability.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Insights: Increasing node_4 height and optimizing diagonal members improves triangulation and load flow. Also, member area assignments must be optimized balancing strength and mass. Using larger area in critical members and minimal area in tension members reduces stress-to-weight ratio. The rank_1 historic design improved stress ratio by increasing areas but mass exceeded 30. So, a middle ground is needed: adjust node_4 position to about 3.1 m height (less than history\'s 3.0-4.0), use 4-5 members with areas varying between 2 and 4, ensuring closed triangular form to avoid node isolation.",\n  "proposal": "Redesign the truss by fixing base nodes as required, reposition node_4 vertically at about (4.0, 3.1) to form better load path, maintain node_3 at (2.0, 0.0). Use 5 members forming closed triangular substructures: base members (node_1-node_2, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3), vertical/diagonal members (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4). Assign areas with emphasis on diagonals to reduce stress and keep mass under 30. Avoid over-large areas to limit mass but ensure stress <7.0 and stress-to-weight ≤ 0.5.",\n  "reasoning": "A stable truss is best achieved by proper triangulation: all triangular members form a closed loop distributing loads efficiently. Node_4 raised slightly over 3.0 m allows better leverage and reduces bending moments on bottom chord members. Larger areas (~3 to 4) for members carrying compression or tension due to load at node_3, smaller areas for less stressed members. Members connecting node_4 to base nodes and node_3 are critical. By balancing node height and member area, stresses decrease and total mass remains within limit. Symmetric structure and load path reduce eccentricities and bending stresses.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: member forces proportional to load magnitude and geometry. Member length calculated by Euclidean distance. Mass = sum(length × area). Area values from given dictionary: \'1\':0.195, \'2\':0.782, \'3\':1.759, \'4\':3.128, \'5\':4.887. Estimate member stress: force/cross-section proportional to area inversely. Target max stress ≤7.0, total mass ≤30, stress/weight ≤0.5. Node coordinates with 1e-2 precision. Calculate lengths, assign areas mainly 2-4, verify mass and stress ratios iteratively.",\n  "calculation": "Node coordinates (fixed): node_1 (0.0, 0.0), node_2 (6.0, 0.0), node_3 (2.0, 0.0). Set node_4 at (4.0, 3.10). Lengths: node_1-node_2=6.0, node_1-node_3=2.0, node_2-node_3=4.0, node_1-node_4=5.0, node_2-node_4=3.6, node_3-node_4=3.16. Member selection (to reduce mass, exclude node_1-node_2 long base): Use members_1: node_1-node_3, member_2: node_2-node_3, member_3: node_1-node_4, member_4: node_2-node_4, member_5: node_3-node_4.

Mass sum = (2.0*1.759)+(4.0*0.195)+(5.0*3.128)+(3.6*0.782)+(3.16*1.759) ≈ 3.518+0.78+15.64+2.82+5.56 =28.32 < 30.
