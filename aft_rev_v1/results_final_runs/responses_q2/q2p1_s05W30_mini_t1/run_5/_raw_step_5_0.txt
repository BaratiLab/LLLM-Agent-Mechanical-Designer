The objective is to redesign a fully connected 2D truss structure minimizing stress-to-weight ratio while satisfying all constraints and maintaining supports and loaded nodes fixed in position.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Current load is at node_3 with force (-15, -30). Supports are pinned at node_1 and roller at nodes 2 and 3. Nodes 1, 2, and 3 are fixed in position. Node_4 is free to adjust. Existing design shows max stress/weight ratio 0.1278 but mass 30.36 > 30 slightly. Historical structures have higher stress and mass tradeoffs. The last best feasible structure suffers from high max stress or mass.",\n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 pulls diagonally downward-left causing tension in members connected to it. Support conditions are asymmetric with two rollers at right nodes allowing vertical reaction only, pinned fixed at node_1. To best distribute load, the structure should form stable triangulation with members forming tension-compression paths. Current design has thick members (area id \'4\') causing high mass. Historical designs with smaller areas sometimes violate stress. Node_4 placement at ~ (4, 3) provides vertical support but may be optimized. Member areas 3 or 4 produce large mass. Member from node_1 to node_4 is a long diagonal, contributing to high mass. Reducing some areas and improving geometry and load path will help satisfy constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "A triangle between nodes 1-3-4 and 2-3-4 forms a stable setup. Node_4 vertical coordinate can be slightly reduced to reduce member length and hence mass, while keeping triangulation intact. Areas can be lowered on less stressed members and increased only on those taking highest loads. Member from nodes 2-3 has too little area (1) but carries some stress; possibly increase slightly. Keep node_1 and node_2 fixed. Introduce finer area gradation, avoiding largest areas (\'4\' = 3.128) unless critically needed.",\n  "proposal": "Redesign the truss by retaining fixed nodes and loads, slightly lowering node_4 to ~3.0 from 3.1 to reduce member length. Use a 5-member closed truss connecting all nodes. Assign member areas balanced to carry stress within limits and keep mass <=30. Members: node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, and node_3-node_4. Use area ids mostly between \'1\' (0.195) and \'3\' (1.759) to reduce mass. Optimize member_1 and member_5 areas for load.",\n  "reasoning": "Applying triangular load paths for stability and symmetrical load distribution, the structure triangulates load from node_3 through node_1 and node_2 supports. Reducing node_4 height decreases member length (mass). The heavy load downward at node_3 requires a robust member from node_1 to node_3 and node_3 to node_4 in tension/compression. Roller constraints limit horizontal reaction at node_2 and node_3 but pinned at node_1 supports horizontal loads. Thus, node_1 to node_3 member should have moderate area \'3\', node_3 to node_4 member area \'3\', other members slightly lighter but adequate to avoid excessive stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate length of members with new node_4 at (4.00, 3.00):\\n- node_1-node_3: distance sqrt((2-0)^2+(0-0)^2) = 2.00\\n- node_2-node_3: distance sqrt((6-2)^2+0)=4.00\\n- node_1-node_4: sqrt((4-0)^2+(3-0)^2)=5.00\\n- node_2-node_4: sqrt((6-4)^2+(0-3)^2)=sqrt(4+9)=3.61\\n- node_3-node_4: sqrt((4-2)^2+(3-0)^2)=sqrt(4+9)=3.61\\nMass = sum(length * area) with area dictionary\\nAssuming areas: member_1=\'3\'(1.759), member_2=\'1\'(0.195), member_3=\'1\'(0.195), member_4=\'2\'(0.782), member_5=\'3\'(1.759)\\nMass = 2*1.759 + 4*0.195 + 5*0.195 + 3.61*0.782 + 3.61*1.759\\n=3.518 +0.78 +0.975 +2.825 +6.35 = approx 14.45 <30\\nEstimate max stress using proportionality: largest loads on member_1 and member_5 with area >=1.759 reduces stress.
