Objective is to optimize member layout and areas while ensuring stress-to-weight ratio <=0.5 and mass <=30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Initial structure nodes: three colinear nodes along x-axis at y=0. Loads: node_3 loaded downward-left; supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 and node_3 rollers. No members yet. Triangulation needed to form closed structure and better load path.",\n    \n    "analysis": "With three nodes colinear, direct members connect node_1-node_2, node_2-node_3, and node_1-node_3 to form a triangle. However, node_3 load acts inclined: -15 N magnitude at -30 degrees → Fx = -15*cos30= -12.99 N, Fy= -15*sin30= -7.5 N. Node_1 pinned prevents translation; node_2 and node_3 roller allow vertical and horizontal movement accordingly. The triangle forms a stable closed truss. But stress concentration could be high along bottom chord. Adding a new node above to form a 4-node trapezoidal truss provides an extra diagonal for better load distribution.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Introducing node_4 above node_3 and node_2 creates a four-node trapezoidal truss, enhancing triangulation. Adding members from node_4 to node_1 and node_3 creates two triangles sharing base node_4 and spreads stresses. It increases total length but allows using smaller areas (lightweight). To keep mass <=30, member areas must be controlled carefully, especially longer diagonals.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (4.0, 3.0), above node_2 (6.0,0) and node_3 (2.0,0), giving a height for triangulation. Members: (node_1-node_2), (node_2-node_3), (node_3-node_1), (node_4-node_1), (node_4-node_3), (node_4-node_2). This ensures full connectivity, load path uplift, and triangulation. Use smaller areas for long diagonals to conserve weight. Main load path under node_3 load transferred via node_4 and node_1 pinned support. Use area_id \'2\' (0.782) or \'1\' (0.195) for diagonals and larger area_id \'3\' (1.759) for bottom chords to balance stress and mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Uniform axial stress in each member, load shared in triangulated paths.
