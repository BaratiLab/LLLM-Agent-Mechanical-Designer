    "preamble": "Designing a minimal stress-to-weight ratio closed 2D truss with given three nodes under asymmetric load and specific supports. Objective is to optimize member layout and areas while ensuring stress-to-weight ratio <=0.5 and mass <=30.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Initial structure nodes: three colinear nodes along x-axis at y=0. Loads: node_3 loaded downward-left; supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 and node_3 rollers. No members yet. Triangulation needed to form closed structure and better load path.",
    
    "analysis": "With three nodes colinear, direct members connect node_1-node_2, node_2-node_3, and node_1-node_3 to form a triangle. However, node_3 load acts inclined: -15 N magnitude at -30 degrees → Fx = -15*cos30= -12.99 N, Fy= -15*sin30= -7.5 N. Node_1 pinned prevents translation; node_2 and node_3 roller allow vertical and horizontal movement accordingly. The triangle forms a stable closed truss. But stress concentration could be high along bottom chord. Adding a new node above to form a 4-node trapezoidal truss provides an extra diagonal for better load distribution.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Introducing node_4 above node_3 and node_2 creates a four-node trapezoidal truss, enhancing triangulation. Adding members from node_4 to node_1 and node_3 creates two triangles sharing base node_4 and spreads stresses. It increases total length but allows using smaller areas (lightweight). To keep mass <=30, member areas must be controlled carefully, especially longer diagonals.",
    
    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (4.0, 3.0), above node_2 (6.0,0) and node_3 (2.0,0), giving a height for triangulation. Members: (node_1-node_2), (node_2-node_3), (node_3-node_1), (node_4-node_1), (node_4-node_3), (node_4-node_2). This ensures full connectivity, load path uplift, and triangulation. Use smaller areas for long diagonals to conserve weight. Main load path under node_3 load transferred via node_4 and node_1 pinned support. Use area_id '2' (0.782) or '1' (0.195) for diagonals and larger area_id '3' (1.759) for bottom chords to balance stress and mass.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Uniform axial stress in each member, load shared in triangulated paths. Member length calculation by Euclidean distance. Total mass=sum(length*area). Stress approximated as axial force/area, max stress from member with largest force/area. Static equilibrium applied at nodes. Calculate forces using method of joints starting from node_1 and node_2 supports.",
    
    "calculation": "Member lengths (rounded to 1e-2): \n"\
    "node_1(0,0)-node_2(6,0) = 6.00,\n"\
    "node_2(6,0)-node_3(2,0) = 4.00,\n"\

    "node_4(4,3)-node_3(2,0) ≈ 3.61,\n"\
    "node_4(4,3)-node_2(6,0) ≈ 3.61.\n"\
    "Assign areas: bottom chord (node1-node2): '4' (3.128), base chords (node3-node1): '3' (1.759), node2-node3: '2' (0.782), diagonals to node4: '1' (0.195).\n"\
    "Mass = sum(length*area): (6*3.128)+(2*1.759)+(4*0.782)+(5*0.195)+(3.61*0.195)+(3.61*0.195)= 18.77 + 3.52 + 3.13 + 0.975 + 0.704 + 0.704 ≈ 27.8 < 30 (good).\n"\
    "Using static analysis, max axial force estimated on bottom chord ~12 N (from load projection). Max stress = force/area approx 12 /3.128=3.84 (relative). Stress-to-weight = max stress / mass =3.84/27.8=0.138 <0.5 (constraint met).\n",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Final structure: 4 nodes, 6 members, closed/truss, all connected. Mass <30, stress-to-weight <0.5. Areas assigned balancing light weight and strength. Supports and loads maintained. Triangulation ensures stability and efficient load transfer.",
