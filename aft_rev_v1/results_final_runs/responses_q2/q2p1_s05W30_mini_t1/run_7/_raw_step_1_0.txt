Objective: minimize stress-to-weight ratio further, keeping structure closed and constrained.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Current design uses larger area members on base (member_1 area 4), and varied smaller areas elsewhere. Total mass ~27.8 under max stress ~6.3, within constraints (max ratio <=0.5 and mass <=30). Load at node_3 is -15N horizontal and -30N vertical approx. Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at nodes 2 and 3. Members form a closed triangle base and 3 members connecting node_4 top.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 induces tension in member_3 (node_3 to 1) as max stress (-6.3) indicating critical tension member. Member_1 (node_1 to 2) with largest area 4 has low stress (-0.56) indicating potential oversizing. Members connecting node_4 have low stress (~ -0.3 to 0.9), likely underutilized. Current base triangle spans from 0.0 to 6.0 along x-axis with node_3 at 2.0 midspan. Vertical node_4 at (4.0, 3.0) provides triangulation but could be better positioned for load path refinement and stress balancing.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 is overdesigned; areas 4 (=3.128) can be reduced to lower mass. Node_4 vertical position could be lowered towards the base to reduce high stress in member_3 from node_3 to node_1 by better load distribution. Consider symmetrizing node_4 closer toward node_3 to reduce lever arm and bending effects. Possibly reduce member_1 area to 3 or 2 (0.782 or 1.759) and increase smaller members minimally. Avoid changing nodes 1,2,3 due to supports and loads.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Optimize current design by lowering node_4 y-position from 3.00 to ~2.0 to improve load distribution. Reduce member_1 area from \'4\'(3.128) to \'3\'(1.759) to reduce mass while monitoring stresses. Keep members connecting node_4 at area \'1\' (0.195) or increase selectively as needed. Adjust node_4 x slightly to 3.75 from 4.0 for better triangulation and reduced max stress in member_3. Maintain closed structure with six members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Lowering and shifting node_4 horizontally reduces moment arm on node_3 and redistributes forces. Reduced member_1 area cuts mass without violating constraints due to its low stress. Tension in member_3 can decrease by better load path via node_4 repositioning. Triangular geometry improves stiffness and stress distribution, expected to reduce max stress similarly or below 6.3 while mass drops below 27.8.

No, ratio increased. But mass decreased significantly.
