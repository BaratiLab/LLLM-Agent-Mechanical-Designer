Previous designs failed to meet the strict stress-to-weight ratio constraint (<=0.5), despite some being light. The objective is to create a closed, triangulated structure that satisfies all constraints, using only valid area IDs and precise node placement.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Key constraints: stress-to-weight ratio <= 0.5, total mass <= 30. Supports and load locations are fixed. Previous attempts used both minimal and heavy trusses, but failed mainly on stress-to-weight ratio. A more efficient load path and triangulation are needed. All nodes must be structurally connected.",\n\n    "analysis": "The load at node_3 is substantial (-15, -30), and node_3 is a roller support. Current and past designs mostly use a single elevated node (node_5 or node_4) to form a triangle, but stresses are concentrated, especially in members connected to node_3. Most area assignments are small (area_id \'1\'), leading to high stress. Larger areas (and/or shorter, better-aligned members) are needed in critical members. The mass constraint is not tight (all designs are well below 30), so increasing area in key members is feasible. Closed triangulation is missing in some attempts, causing poor load distribution.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "High stress is always found in members directly taking the vertical/horizontal load from node_3. Adding a second elevated node and forming a Warren truss (with two upper nodes) could distribute forces better and reduce peak stress. Using larger area members (area_id \'2\' or \'3\') for diagonals/chords under high stress is justified, as mass is not the limiting factor.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss as a symmetric Warren-type structure: keep nodes 1, 2, 3 fixed, add two elevated nodes (node_4 and node_5) above node_1 and node_2, respectively. Connect all lower nodes to both upper nodes, forming a fully triangulated, closed truss. Assign larger area to members expected to take the highest stress (main diagonals/chords). This should distribute load efficiently and reduce the peak stress-to-weight ratio.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Symmetry ensures balanced force paths. Triangulation prevents mechanism formation and distributes forces. Placing node_4 above node_1 and node_5 above node_2, with both at moderate height, creates short, direct load paths and reduces member length (thus stress and mass). Use area_id \'2\' or \'3\' for the bottom chord and main diagonals. Use area_id \'1\' for less critical, shorter members. This approach leverages the available mass budget to reduce stress-to-weight ratio below 0.5.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Main load at node_3 is shared between diagonals to upper nodes. Set node_4 at (1.0, 2.5), node_5 at (5.0, 2.5) for symmetry. Members: bottom chord (node_1-node_2), verticals (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_5), diagonals (node_3-node_4, node_3-node_5), top chord (node_4-node_5), and diagonals between node_4/5 and node_1/2. Use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for the bottom chord and main diagonals, area_id \'1\' (0.195) for others. Calculate member lengths, estimate peak force in diagonals (about half the vertical load, so ~15-20), check if stress < 0.5*total_weight.",\n\n    "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_2: 6.0; node_4-node_5: 4.0; node_1-node_4: sqrt(1^2+2.5^2)=2.69; node_2-node_5: sqrt(1^2+2.5^2)=2.69; node_3-node_4: sqrt(1^2+2.5^2)=2.69; node_3-node_5: sqrt(3^2+2.5^2)=3.91. Assign area_id \'2\' (0.782) to node_1-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_3-node_5. Assign area_id \'1\' to others. Mass: (6.0+2.69+2.69)*0.782 + (4.0+2.69+2.69+3.91)*0.195 ≈ (11.38)*0.782 + (13.29)*0.195 ≈ 8.90 + 2.59 ≈ 11.49. Estimated max member force: ~20, so stress in area 0.782: 20/0.782 ≈ 25.6. Total weight ~11.49, so stress-to-weight ratio ~2.2. This is still high. Increase area to \'3\' (1.759) for the main diagonals and bottom chord: stress = 20/1.759 ≈ 11.4, mass increases to (11.38)*1.759 + (13.29)*0.195 ≈ 20.03 + 2.59 ≈ 22.62, stress-to-weight ratio ≈ 0.5. This fits the constraint.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Redesign with node_4 at (1.0, 2.5), node_5 at (5.0, 2.5). Use area_id \'3\' for bottom chord and diagonals from node_3 to upper nodes, area_id \'1\' for other members. All nodes are connected, structure is closed, and calculations show constraints are satisfied. Final check: total mass ~22.6, max stress-to-weight ratio ~0.5.
