Previous iterations all failed to meet the constraints, especially the stress-to-weight ratio. The objective is to generate a closed, triangulated, minimal-mass truss that distributes loads efficiently and satisfies all constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs: Load at node_3 (-15, -30), supports: node_1 (pinned), node_2 and node_3 (roller). Current and historical structures are either too heavy or too stressed. Constraints: stress-to-weight ratio ≤0.5, mass ≤30. The structure must be closed and all nodes with supports/loads must remain fixed. Area_id selection is critical for weight and stress control.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current and historic designs are either too heavy (mass > 19, some > 50) or have excessive stress-to-weight ratios (lowest ~0.63, most >1, current is 11.376). The main issue is under-triangulation or inefficient load paths, especially at node_3 (load application). Most designs use large area_id values for vertical or diagonal members, making them heavy. The best historic mass (4.99) had excessive stress, indicating insufficient triangulation or poor force distribution. The load is highly eccentric (not at midspan), so symmetric trusses are suboptimal. A Warren or K-truss with a low, central apex may distribute forces better. Adding a new node above node_3 and connecting it to all base nodes will create a robust, triangulated system. All nodes must be connected to avoid isolated elements.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: (1) Under-triangulated or poorly distributed structures have high stress; (2) Overbuilt structures are too heavy. (3) The load at node_3 is critical; its direct connection to supports is needed. (4) Triangulation above node_3 will help. Insight: A compact, triangulated truss with a low apex above node_3 and minimal area_id values will best meet constraints.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign: Add a single apex node (node_5) above node_3, forming two triangles from each support to the apex. Connect node_5 to nodes 1, 2, 3. Connect node_1 to node_3 and node_2 to node_3 for load transfer. Use minimal area_id (\'1\' or \'2\') for all members, except the vertical from node_3 to node_5, which may need a slightly larger area_id if required by stress. This forms a closed, triangulated truss with minimal mass and controlled stress.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation ensures all members are in tension/compression only, minimizing bending. Placing the apex directly above node_3 (load application) shortens force paths and reduces member forces. Symmetry about the load is not needed due to the eccentricity. Using minimal area_id values keeps the mass low, and the vertical member above node_3 directly resists the vertical load. The triangles distribute force efficiently to both supports. All nodes are connected, satisfying the closure requirement.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Steel (or similar), so high allowable stress. All supports/loads at fixed nodes. Set node_5 at (2.0, 2.5) to minimize member lengths and provide vertical height for triangulation. Members: (1-3), (3-2), (1-5), (2-5), (3-5). Use area_id \'1\' (A=0.195) for all members initially, except (3-5) which may need \'2\' (A=0.782) if stress is high. Calculate member lengths, estimate mass, and check that max force in any member divided by total mass ≤0.5. If not, increase area_id on the most stressed member only.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: (1-3): 2.0, (3-2): 4.0, (1-5): sqrt(2^2 + 2.5^2)=3.20, (2-5): sqrt(4^2+2.5^2)=4.72, (3-5): 2.5. Total length ≈ 2.0+4.0+3.20+4.72+2.5=16.42. Using area_id \'1\' (A=0.195) for all: Mass=16.42*0.195=3.20. If (3-5) needs more area: (2.5*0.782)+(rest*0.195)=1.96+13.92*0.195=1.96+2.72=4.68. Max member force (vertical) will be ~load magnitude (30kN). Stress in (3-5): 30/0.782=38.4 (safe, as max_stress-to-weight=38.4/4.68=8.2>0.5). So, increase area_id of (3-5) to \'5\' (A=4.887): 2.5*4.887=12.22, rest=2.72, total mass=14.94, stress=30/4.887=6.13, ratio=6.13/14.94=0.41<0.5. Now all constraints are satisfied.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "All supports and load nodes are unchanged. All nodes are connected. All members are triangulated. The most stressed member (3-5) is sized up to area_id \'5\' (A=4.887) to keep stress-to-weight ratio below 0.5. Total mass is well below 30.
