    "preamble": "The task is to design an optimized 2D truss structure with three supported nodes and one loaded node, aiming to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio below 0.5 and keep total mass under 30 units. The current and historic designs violate the stress-to-weight constraint, mainly due to inefficient load transfer and oversized members.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs: Pinned at node_1, rollers at node_2 and node_3, load at node_3 (-15.0, -30.0). Current and historic trusses are over-stressed or too heavy. Objective: closed, triangulated, minimal-mass truss with stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 0.5.",
    
    "analysis": "The current design and history show that the load at node_3 is causing high forces in long, nearly horizontal members, especially member_5 (node_3-node_4) which is oversized and inefficient. The truss is not well triangulated near the loaded node; the vertical component of the load is not effectively transferred to supports. Historic attempts with more nodes (e.g., node_5) result in excessive mass without sufficient stress reduction. The supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2/node_3 (rollers) define a base; node_3's load is best resolved by triangulation toward both supports. The main failure mode is excessive stress in the longest members and inefficient area allocation.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Key pattern: All constraint violations stem from poor triangulation and inefficient member sizing. The loaded node is not sufficiently braced vertically. Adding a higher node above node_3 and connecting it to all base nodes can create a lightweight, highly triangulated truss. The main area for improvement is the geometry around node_3 and the use of minimal-area members elsewhere.",
    
    "proposal": "Redesign the truss by introducing a new node (node_5) directly above node_3 to create two efficient triangles, connecting node_5 to all base nodes. This will distribute the vertical load more effectively and allow the use of smaller-area members, reducing both stress and mass. Retain original support/load nodes and only adjust free node positions. Use minimal-area members where possible and assign larger areas only to highly loaded members.",
    
    "reasoning": "A classic solution for a point load at midspan is a 'Warren' or 'Pratt' truss. By adding node_5 above node_3 (say at [2.0, 2.8]), the structure forms two triangles (node_1-node_3-node_5 and node_3-node_2-node_5), efficiently distributing the load. All nodes remain connected, and the truss is closed. The vertical component of the load at node_3 is now resolved by compression in the new vertical and diagonal members, reducing stress in the longest members. The areas can be minimized except for the diagonals and verticals directly under load. Node positions are chosen to keep all members short and at favorable angles.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume: all supports and load nodes fixed. Place node_5 at (2.0, 2.8) above node_3. Connect node_5 to all three base nodes for full triangulation. Member areas: use '1' (0.195 area) for most, except for the vertical (node_3-node_5) and diagonals (node_1-node_5, node_2-node_5) which may need area '2' (0.782) or '3' (1.759) to ensure low stress. Calculate member lengths, estimate member forces by static equilibrium (vertical at node_5 resists most of load), estimate stresses, and sum total mass. Adjust areas as needed to keep max(abs(stress))/total_mass ≤ 0.5, and total mass ≤ 30.",
    
    "calculation": "Node positions: node_1 (0.0,0.0), node_2 (6.0,0.0), node_3 (2.0,0.0), node_5 (2.0,2.8). Members: node_1-node_2 (base), node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_5, node_2-node_5, node_3-node_5. Estimated lengths: base (6.0), node_1-node_3 (2.0), node_2-node_3 (4.0), node_1-node_5 (sqrt(2^2+2.8^2)=3.44), node_2-node_5 (sqrt(4^2+2.8^2)=4.88), node_3-node_5 (2.8). Assign area '1' (0.195) to all except node_3-node_5 (vertical under load), which gets area '3' (1.759). Mass: sum(length*area). Estimate member forces: most of the vertical load at node_3 is taken by node_3-node_5, with diagonals sharing the rest. With this geometry and sizing, max member force is on node_3-node_5, but with area '3', stress is low. Total mass = 6.0*0.195 + 2.0*0.195 + 4.0*0.195 + 3.44*0.195 + 4.88*0.195 + 2.8*1.759 = 1.17+0.39+0.78+0.67+0.95+4.93=8.89. Max stress (vertical) is load/area = 33.54/1.759=19.07. Stress-to-weight = 19.07/8.89=2.15, but most load is shared by diagonals. If diagonals are area '2' (0.782), their length*area=3.44*0.782+4.88*0.782=2.69+3.82=6.51, total mass=8.89+6.51-0.67-0.95=13.78. Now, stress-to-weight=19.07/13.78=1.38. To further reduce, increase vertical area to '4' (3.128): 2.8*3.128=8.76, total mass=8.89-4.93+8.76=12.72. Stress=33.54/3.128=10.73, stress-to-weight=10.73/12.72=0.84. To reach ≤0.5, increase vertical to '5' (4.887): 2.8*4.887=13.68, total mass=8.89-4.93+13.68=17.64, stress=33.54/4.887=6.86, stress-to-weight=6.86/17.64=0.39. All constraints satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Final check: all nodes are connected, load and support nodes unchanged, triangulation complete, all constraints satisfied (mass=17.64<30, stress-to-weight=0.39<0.5). Node positions precise, areas minimal. Ready to output.",
