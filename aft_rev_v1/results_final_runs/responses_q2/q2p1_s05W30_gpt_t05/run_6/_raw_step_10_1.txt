The current and historic designs fail the stress-to-weight constraint; the objective is to deliver a closed, efficient, constraint-satisfying truss.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: minimize stress-to-weight ratio (<=0.5), total mass (<=30), with a closed, connected truss. Loads, supports, and node positions for supports/loads are fixed. Current and historic structures are either too stressed or inefficiently heavy. Need a new, more efficient layout.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current structure and all historic variants have stress-to-weight ratios above 0.5 (lowest is 0.8977) and masses well within the limit, indicating that the problem is not with overweight but with inefficient force paths. Most designs use a Warren or Pratt-like arrangement, but with excessive member lengths or insufficient triangulation. The main load (-15, -30) at node_3 is large and eccentric; supports are at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), and node_3 (roller). The truss must efficiently transfer this load to the supports, suggesting a need for direct triangulation from node_3 to both supports and an upper chord for stability. Prior designs often had long, lightly triangulated upper members, resulting in high member forces. The best historic structure (iteration 2) still had member_1 (node_1-node_3) at -15.53 stress, with a total mass of 17.3, but failed the stress-to-weight constraint.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The stress constraint is the limiting factor. Key insight: reduce the length and force in the most heavily loaded members by (1) introducing a central top node above node_3, (2) creating a more equilateral triangulation, and (3) using the smallest possible area that meets the stress constraint. Prior designs lack a central upper node, resulting in poor force distribution. Adding a central top node should reduce force in the bottom chord and distribute the load more efficiently.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss by adding a new node (node_6) above node_3, forming a symmetric, double-triangle (Pratt) truss with short diagonals. Connect node_3 to node_6, node_1, and node_2; connect node_6 to node_1 and node_2, and to node_4 and node_5 (upper corners). Move node_4 and node_5 slightly closer to the centerline for better triangulation. Use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for critical diagonals and area_id \'1\' (0.195) for less stressed members, adjusting as needed to ensure all member stresses are below 0.5 × total mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By introducing node_6 at (2.0, 2.8) above node_3, and shifting upper nodes node_4 (1.2, 2.0) and node_5 (3.0, 2.0), we can split the main load at node_3 into two diagonal paths, reducing force in each. The top chord (node_4-node_6-node_5) stabilizes the structure. All nodes are well connected, forming a closed, triangulated truss. This layout is efficient, symmetric, and minimizes member lengths, reducing both stress and mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All member areas are chosen to keep max member stress below 0.5 × total mass. Use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for diagonals from node_3 to node_4/node_5 and from node_3 to node_6, as these will see highest forces. Use area_id \'1\' (0.195) for top and bottom chords. Estimate member forces via statics: the load at node_3 is split between diagonals to node_4, node_5, and node_6. The vertical height of node_6 (2.8) above node_3 gives favorable force angles. All members are short, reducing force and mass. Estimate total mass: sum(length × area) for all members, ensure < 30. Estimate max stress: sum of vertical reactions at supports must balance the applied load; member forces determined by geometry and load splitting.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Key members: node_3-node_6, node_3-node_4, node_3-node_5 (diagonals); node_6-node_4, node_6-node_5 (top chords); node_1-node_4, node_2-node_5 (side chords); node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3 (bottom chords); node_1-node_2 (base). All members are short (≤3 units); area_id \'2\' for diagonals, area_id \'1\' for chords. Estimated total length ≈ 20 units; mass ≈ (10×0.782 + 10×0.195) = 9.77. Max member force (diagonal): estimate by resolving load at node_3, split between three diagonals, each sees ~(-15²+(-30)²)^0.5/3 ≈ 11.2. Max stress per member: 11.2/0.782 ≈ 14.3, total mass ≈ 9.77, stress-to-weight ratio ≈ 1.46. To meet constraint (≤0.5), increase area_id for diagonals to \'3\' (1.759), reducing max stress to 11.2/1.759 ≈ 6.37, stress-to-weight ≈ 0.65. Still high; try area_id \'4\' (3.128) for diagonals: 11.2/3.128 ≈ 3.58, stress-to-weight ≈ 0.37. This meets constraint. Total mass now ≈ (3×3.128 + 7×0.195) ≈ 9.38. Well under mass limit.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Final check: All nodes are connected; no isolated nodes. Member areas selected to keep max stress-to-weight ratio ≤0.5 and total mass <30.
