The current and past structures violate the stress-to-weight constraint, so a new, more efficient truss layout is needed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The objective is to design a closed, efficient truss spanning nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), with supports at nodes 1, 2, 3, and a downward load at node_3. Past attempts used polygons with extra nodes, but all exceeded the stress-to-weight constraint.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current and historical designs show excessive stress concentration in the bottom chord (notably member_1 between node_1 and node_3). Most designs are polygons with verticals and diagonals, but the stress-to-weight ratio remains above 0.5. The load at node_3 is significant and creates a strong moment. The supports at nodes 1 (pinned), 2 (roller), and 3 (roller) require a stable, triangulated structure. Many historic designs over-concentrate members in the bottom chord, causing high stress there. The mass is always below the 30 threshold, so the main issue is stress distribution.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Stress is highest in members directly under the load and insufficient triangulation leads to stress concentration. The best approach is to use a Pratt or Howe truss form, ensuring all joints are triangulated, and avoid long, unstiffened members. Using more members with smaller area (lower area_id) can distribute load better and reduce max stress.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss as a compact, fully triangulated Pratt-type structure with five nodes: nodes 1, 2, 3 (fixed), and two new nodes above the base (4, 5) to form a triangle above node_3. Members will be chosen to ensure all triangles are closed, and area_ids will be minimized. Node positions will be adjusted for optimal height and spread. All connections will be direct, with no redundant members.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A Pratt truss (with diagonals sloping toward midspan) is efficient for this span/load/support setup. Placing nodes 4 and 5 above the base at calculated heights will create optimal triangles. The main load path will go from node_3 up to node_4 and node_5, then down to nodes 1 and 2, distributing the force. Using small area_ids for diagonals and verticals, and slightly larger for the bottom chord, will balance mass and stress. All nodes will be connected, and no member will be excessively long.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Steel, uniform member properties. Choose node_4 at (2.0, 2.6) (above node_3), node_5 at (4.0, 1.6) (midway up right). Connect: 1-3, 3-2, 1-4, 3-4, 4-5, 5-2, 3-5, 1-5. Use area_id \'0\' for bottom chord, \'1\' for diagonals/verticals. Est. member forces: bottom chord (compression), diagonals (tension), verticals (shear). Mass = Σ(length × area). Stress = force/area. Max stress distributed over more members, so stress-to-weight ratio drops.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: 1-3 = 2.0, 3-2 = 4.0, 1-4 = sqrt(2^2 + 2.6^2) ≈ 3.28, 3-4 = 2.6, 4-5 = sqrt(2^2 + 1^2) ≈ 2.24, 5-2 = sqrt(2^2 + 1.6^2) ≈ 2.56, 3-5 = sqrt(2^2 + 1.6^2) ≈ 2.56, 1-5 = sqrt(4^2 + 1.6^2) ≈ 4.31. Total length ≈ 23.55. Mass: bottom chord (area 1) = 6.0, others (area 0.195) = (23.55-6.0)*0.195 ≈ 3.44. Total mass ≈ 9.44.
