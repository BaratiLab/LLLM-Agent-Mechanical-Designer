The objective is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio (≤0.5) and keep total mass ≤30, while ensuring all nodes are connected and the structure is feasible.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The current structure (iteration 11/25) has a stress-to-weight ratio of 0.5134 (>0.5 constraint) and mass of 30.0133 (>30 constraint). Most prior structures also violate the ratio and/or mass. The main load is at node_3, which is supported (roller) and at ground level. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) are at ground level. Structure must be closed, with no isolated nodes.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current and historic designs show that stresses are highest in the lower chord (especially member_1: node_1-node_3, -15.41), with other members carrying much less. Many previous attempts failed due to high stress in the bottom chord or excessive mass when using larger cross-sections. The load at node_3 is large and off-center, creating significant moment and shear. Most failed designs rely on a single bottom chord to carry the load, with insufficient triangulation or inefficient member arrangement. The most efficient designs for such loading use a symmetric Pratt or Warren truss with diagonal bracing, distributing forces through triangulation, and minimizing the length and area of highly stressed members. Increasing the height of the truss will reduce the force in the bottom chord, but may increase mass if not carefully designed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key insight: The bottom chord between node_1 and node_3 is consistently overstressed. To reduce this, increase the vertical height and use a double-diagonal system (Pratt/Warren), distributing the load more evenly. Use the minimum area for lightly loaded members and increase the area only for the most critical ones. Avoid unnecessary members and keep the structure as compact as possible. Ensure all nodes are connected and the structure is closed.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss as a compact, efficient Pratt truss with a raised top chord, using four main nodes (node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4), and add a central top node (node_5) to maximize triangulation. Use a larger area only for the highly stressed lower chord, and minimum area for diagonals and verticals. Keep node_3 fixed, as it carries the load and is a roller support.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A Pratt/Warren truss with a central top node allows for efficient distribution of the applied load at node_3 to both supports. By raising the top chord, the vertical component of member forces increases, reducing the force in the bottom chord. Diagonals transfer loads efficiently to supports. The structure is fully triangulated and closed, minimizing the risk of mechanism formation. Member areas are chosen based on expected force (bottom chord largest, others minimum feasible).",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Steel or similar material, area_id \'0\' (A=1) for most members, area_id \'2\' (A=0.782) for bottom chord. Truss height set at 2.5 for optimal force distribution. Node positions: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (4,0), node_5 (3,2.5). Members: bottom chord (node_1-node_3-node_4-node_2), top chord (node_1-node_5-node_2), diagonals (node_3-node_5, node_4-node_5). Calculate force in each member by static equilibrium (approximate for symmetry), estimate mass, and check constraints.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths (m): node_1-node_3:2, node_3-node_4:2, node_4-node_2:2, node_1-node_5:3.60, node_5-node_2:3.60, node_3-node_5:2.50, node_4-node_5:2.50. Use area_id \'2\' for bottom chord (A=0.782), \'0\' for others (A=1). Mass = Σ(length × area). Bottom chord likely sees max force, estimated at 80% of applied load (30kN), so ~24kN. For area 0.782, stress = 24/0.782 ≈ 30.7, but total mass is much lower than 30. To satisfy stress constraint, use area_id \'4\' (A=3.128) for node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_4, yielding stress ≈ 7.7. Use area_id \'0\' elsewhere. Mass: (2+2)*3.128 + (2+2+2.5+2.5+3.6+3.6)*1 ≈ 12.5 + 16.2 ≈ 28.7 < 30.
