    "preamble": "This is a 2D truss optimization problem. The current design at iteration 12/25 is constraint-satisfying, with a stress-to-weight ratio of 0.1433 and total mass 27.71. The objective is to further minimize the stress-to-weight ratio while keeping the total mass ≤ 30 and the ratio ≤ 0.5, using only allowed cross-sectional areas. All supports and loaded nodes must remain fixed. The structure must be closed and all nodes connected.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "The current best design is a pentagon with an internal node and full triangulation, using area_id '4' (3.128) for the bottom chords and '0' (1) for the diagonals/verticals. The only load is at node_3. Supports are at nodes 1, 2, and 3. All constraints are satisfied. History shows attempts at lighter/alternative geometries failed constraints or performed worse.",
    
    "analysis": "The current structure is efficient: a closed, triangulated truss, with the top node_5 providing depth and stability. The main load at node_3 is carried into the supports via two bottom chords (members_1,2,3) and two triangles (1-3-5, 3-4-5, 4-2-5, 1-5-2). All member stresses are low except member_1 (-3.97), which is still within the area’s capacity. The structure is nearly symmetric and uses the minimum number of nodes for a stable, efficient form. Attempts to reduce the number of nodes or use lighter members led to higher stresses or constraint violations. The mass is already close to the lower bound for this geometry, and the stress-to-weight ratio is much lower than the constraint limit (0.1433 vs 0.5).",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "No clear inefficiencies: all members are engaged, and the node layout is optimal for load transfer. Reducing member areas or lengths further would risk constraint violation. Moving node_5 higher would increase member lengths and mass. Lowering node_5 risks instability and higher stresses. Reducing area_id on the bottom chord will overload member_1. Adding more nodes increases mass and complexity without clear benefit. All alternative geometries in history performed worse or failed constraints.",
    
    "proposal": "Retain the current structure, as it is already close to optimal for the given constraints and objectives. No changes to node positions or member areas are justified by the analysis. Stopping optimization at this step is reasonable, as further modifications risk violating constraints or increasing the stress-to-weight ratio.",
    
    "reasoning": "The current truss is a minimal, fully triangulated form, which is structurally optimal for transferring a single load at node_3 to three supports. The use of area_id '4' on critical bottom chords ensures low stress, while lighter diagonals minimize mass. All members are necessary for stability and efficient load transfer. The geometry cannot be improved without violating constraints or increasing the objective.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All node positions with supports/loads are fixed. Member forces are balanced; the highest stress (-3.97) is well below the area capacity. Mass calculation: sum of member lengths × area. All constraints are satisfied. No further reduction in area or length is possible without overloading members. No floating nodes.",
    
    "calculation": "Reconfirm: max(abs(stress)) = 3.97, total_mass = 27.71, stress-to-weight ratio = 0.1433, all < constraint limits. All node positions are precise, and all members are connected. No redundant or missing members. No constraint violations.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Final check: All instructions followed. No further improvement possible without constraint violation. Current structure is optimal for the given load, supports, and geometry. Stopping optimization.",
    
    "stop": "True # The current design is already optimal: all constraints are satisfied, the stress-to-weight ratio is far below the limit, and all alternative geometries performed worse or failed constraints. No further improvement possible.",
