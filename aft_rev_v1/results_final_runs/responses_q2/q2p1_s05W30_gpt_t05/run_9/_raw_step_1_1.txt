The current design violates the stress-to-weight ratio constraint (1.92 > 0.5) while mass is acceptable (25.16 < 30). The goal is to redesign or optimize the structure to reduce the stress-to-weight ratio below 0.5 while keeping mass under 30, ensuring full connectivity and no changes to nodes with loads/supports.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives: Minimize stress-to-weight ratio (<=0.5), keep mass<=30, maintain a closed truss. Current design has excessive stress in member_3 (-48.32), likely due to poor load path or oversized member_6 (very high mass, low stress). Nodes with supports/loads (node_1, node_2, node_3) must not move.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure forms a near-triangular truss with an elevated node_4. The large negative stress in member_3 (node_3-node_1) and very heavy member_6 (node_3-node_4) indicate inefficient load distribution. The load at node_3 (-15, -30) acts downward and left; current geometry routes much of this force directly into member_3, overloading it. Member_6 is oversized but carries negligible force. The structure is closed but not efficiently triangulated for the given load and support positions.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key concern: member_3 overstressed, member_6 overbuilt. The triangle (node_1, node_2, node_3) is shallow and does not effectively transfer vertical load. Node_4 is too close to the base, limiting the height and thus the moment arm for vertical force transfer. A more vertical truss (taller node_4) could reduce member_3 force. Redundant or ineffective members should be removed or resized.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss by raising node_4 higher above the base to improve load path and force distribution. Remove the oversized member_6 and use only efficient triangulation. Select minimum adequate member areas for all members based on estimated forces. Maintain all support/load node positions, but reposition node_4 to (3.0, 4.0) for better geometry. Use only as many members as needed for a stable, closed truss.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By raising node_4, the vertical component of member forces increases, reducing the force in the heavily loaded horizontal member_3. A classic triangulated truss (two triangles) with node_4 at (3.0, 4.0) distributes the load more evenly, reducing peak stress. Removing the redundant, heavy member_6 and ensuring all members are efficiently sized further reduces mass and improves the stress-to-weight ratio. Triangulation ensures stability and efficient force paths.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members sized for estimated max force ~10 kN, so area_id \'2\' (0.782) is sufficient for most members. Mass = Σ(length × area). Force in members estimated by geometry and load path: raising node_4 increases vertical projection, reducing horizontal member force. Remove member_6, use only the following members: node_1-node_2, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_1 (base), node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4 (verticals/diagonals). Member lengths recalculated for new node_4 position.",\n    \n    "calculation": "New node_4: (3.0, 4.0). Member lengths: node_1-node_2 = 6.0; node_2-node_3 = 4.0; node_3-node_1 = 2.0; node_1-node_4 = sqrt(3^2 + 4^2) = 5.0; node_2-node_4 = sqrt(3^2 + 4^2) = 5.0; node_3-node_4 = sqrt(1^2 + 4^2) = 4.12. Total mass = (6.0+4.0+2.0+5.0+5.0+4.12) × 0.782 = 20.36 (well under 30).
