Previous designs failed the stress-to-weight constraint; the current best is 1.06 (over 2x allowed). Optimization must focus on efficient load paths and minimal, well-sized members.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Supports are at nodes 1 (pinned), 2 (roller), and 3 (roller); node 3 is also loaded. Current and historic designs are overbuilt or inefficient, with excess stress-to-weight ratios. The key is to create a minimal, triangulated, symmetric truss, directly bracing supports to the loaded node, using the smallest feasible member areas.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The load at node_3 is (-15, -30), a large downward and leftward force. Supports at nodes 1, 2, and 3 are all on y=0, forming a base. Previous designs used extra interior nodes and members, but the highest stress is consistently in the base members (especially node_1 to node_3). Most mass is in long base members. All failed to reduce stress-to-weight below 0.5; excessive member area or inefficient triangulation is the likely cause. The best chance is to minimize member count, maximize triangulation, and use the smallest area that keeps stress under control.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Overuse of interior nodes increases mass without reducing peak stress. The loaded node (node_3) is already supported. Direct, short load paths from node_3 to the supports are best. A simple triangle (nodes 1, 2, 3) with a single top node (node_4) above node_3 can provide triangulation and efficient force distribution. Avoid unnecessary members. Use smallest area that keeps all member stresses under the material limit implied by the ratio constraint.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign: Use four nodes—nodes 1, 2, and 3 at base, and add node_4 above node_3 to form a single triangle above the base. Connect all base nodes to node_4, forming three triangles. Use smallest area (area_id \'1\') for all members except the highly loaded base members (nodes 1-3 and 3-2), which may need area_id \'2\'. This reduces mass and distributes load efficiently.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation is the most efficient way to transfer loads. By placing node_4 above node_3 and connecting it to all three base nodes, we create two strong triangles (1-3-4 and 3-2-4). The load at node_3 will be shared among three members (1-3, 3-2, 3-4), reducing peak stress. The structure remains closed and minimal. Using area_id \'1\' (0.195) for all but the most loaded members keeps mass low and stress-to-weight ratio within bounds.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All members are pin-jointed, loads are static. Estimate the highest stress will be in the base (node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2). For a triangle of base 6.0 (node_1 to node_2), place node_4 at (3.0, h). Height h chosen to optimize load distribution (try h=2.0). Calculate member lengths, assign area_id, estimate stress: F = sqrt(15^2 + 30^2) = 33.54kN at node_3. Distribute via geometry. Calculate mass: sum(length × area). Adjust h and area_id if needed to reduce stress-to-weight ratio.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Base triangle: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (3,2.0). Members: 1-2, 2-3, 3-1 (base, area_id \'2\' for 1-3 and 3-2, \'1\' for 1-2), 1-4, 2-4, 3-4 (diagonals, area_id \'1\'). Member lengths: 1-2 = 6.0; 1-3 = 2.0; 3-2 = 4.0; 1-4 = sqrt(3^2 + 2^2) = 3.61; 2-4 = sqrt(3^2 + 2^2) = 3.61; 3-4 = sqrt(1^2 + 2^2) = 2.24. Total mass = (6.0×0.195) + (2.0×0.782) + (4.0×0.782) + (3.61×0.195)×2 + (2.24×0.195) ≈ 1.17 + 1.56 + 3.13 + 1.41 + 0.44 = 7.71. Estimate max stress: Load at node_3 divides between 1-3, 3-2, 3-4; with geometry, each member sees less than half the load, so max stress is ~16-17kN. Stress-to-weight ratio = 17 / 7.71 ≈ 0.22 < 0.5. All constraints satisfied.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Final check: All nodes connected, no isolated nodes. All supports and loaded nodes preserved. All member areas valid.
