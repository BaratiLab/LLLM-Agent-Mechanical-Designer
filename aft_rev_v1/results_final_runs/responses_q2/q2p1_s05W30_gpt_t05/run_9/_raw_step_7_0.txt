The previous designs failed to meet the stress-to-weight ratio constraint (<=0.5), with the best being 0.7676. The objective is to minimize this ratio while keeping total mass under 30, using only allowed cross-sectional areas, and ensuring the structure is closed and all constraints are satisfied.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs clarify: supports at nodes 1, 2, 3 (pinned and rollers), load at node_3 (-15, -30), node positions are mostly colinear except for node_4, which is above node_3. The main constraint violation is the stress-to-weight ratio; previous attempts either had too high max stress or inefficient member layout. The structure must be closed and minimal in mass.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current and historic designs are simple triangles or quadrilaterals, with node_4 providing height for triangulation. The load at node_3 is significant and off-axis, so direct triangulation from node_3 to the supports is essential. Prior designs used thick (area_id \'0\') bottom chords, but their mass is large relative to the achieved stress. Adding an additional node above node_3 (to create a more optimal Warren or Pratt truss) may further distribute forces and reduce max member stress. The history shows that reducing member areas too far increases max stress, while overly thick members increase weight without improving the stress-to-weight ratio.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key insight: the bottom chord (nodes 1–2–3) carries most tension/compression; node_4\'s vertical position is critical for distributing the vertical load at node_3. Adding a fifth node above node_3 (midspan) can allow for a double-triangle (Pratt/Warren) configuration, further reducing the stress in the longest members. Use minimal area in diagonals and verticals, largest only in bottom chord if needed. All nodes must remain connected.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign by adding node_5 above node_3 at (2.0, 2.0), forming a double-triangle truss: nodes 1–3–2 as the base, node_4 at (4.0, 2.5) (shifted right for symmetry and triangulation), and node_5 above node_3. Connect all nodes to form closed triangles, use minimal cross-section for diagonals/verticals, and only increase area where stress requires. This should reduce both max stress and total mass, achieving the constraints.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A double-triangle truss efficiently distributes loads: node_5 above node_3 allows the vertical load to be shared among more members, reducing peak stress. Placing node_4 to the right of node_3 and above the base extends the lever arm for force distribution. Keeping the bottom chord as short as possible reduces its length and hence mass. Use area_id \'1\' (0.195) for diagonals/verticals, area_id \'0\' (1) only if strictly necessary on the bottom chord. All nodes are connected for closure.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: (1) Load at node_3 splits between verticals and diagonals; (2) Members in compression (top chords/diagonals) get smaller area; (3) Bottom chord may need area_id \'0\' for stress. Calculations: Estimate member forces via method of joints (for a symmetrical truss under central load), then check if area_id \'1\' suffices for all but bottom chord. Mass = Σ(length × area). For stress-to-weight, max(abs(stress))/total_mass must be <=0.5. Node_1 at (0,0), node_2 at (6,0), node_3 at (2,0), node_4 at (4,2.5), node_5 at (2,2.0).",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member list: (1) node_1-node_3, (2) node_3-node_2, (3) node_1-node_5, (4) node_3-node_5, (5) node_2-node_5, (6) node_3-node_4, (7) node_2-node_4, (8) node_5-node_4, (9) node_1-node_4. Estimate lengths: node_1-node_3=2.0, node_3-node_2=4.0, node_1-node_5=√((2-0)^2+(2-0)^2)=2.83, node_3-node_5=2.0, node_2-node_5=√((6-2)^2+(0-2)^2)=4.47, node_3-node_4=√((4-2)^2+(2.5-0)^2)=3.20, node_2-node_4=√((6-4)^2+(0-2.5)^2)=3.20, node_5-node_4=√((4-2)^2+(2.5-2)^2)=2.06, node_1-node_4=√((4-0)^2+(2.5-0)^2)=4.72. Assign area_id \'1\' (0.195) to all members except node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2, which get area_id \'0\' (1). Mass = (2.0+4.0)*1 + (2.83+2.0+4.47+3.20+3.20+2.06+4.72)*0.195 = 6.0 + (22.48)*0.195 = 6.0 + 4.39 = 10.39.
