The objective is to minimize the maximum stress-to-weight ratio, ensuring it does not exceed 0.5, and total mass remains ≤ 30. The design must connect all nodes and may add new nodes if beneficial.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three nodes: node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 (roller, loaded with (-15, -30)). The truss must be closed and all nodes interconnected. A direct triangle is possible, but stress may be high. Triangulation or adding a node above the base may reduce max stress and weight ratio. Area IDs must be chosen for optimal mass/stress tradeoff.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The load at node_3 is significant (-15, -30), acting left and down. node_1 (0,0) is pinned, node_2 (6,0) roller, node_3 (2,0) roller. The nodes are colinear, so a triangle is not possible unless a new node is introduced off the x-axis. A basic solution is to add node_4 above node_3, forming a triangle (node_1, node_2, node_4), with node_3 braced to node_4. This will distribute the load efficiently, reduce stress in horizontal members, and close the truss. Failure modes: excessive stress in the bottom chord if left unbraced; instability if structure is not triangulated.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The direct linkage (node_1-node_2-node_3) is unstable and cannot resist vertical loads unless a node is added above the x-axis. By introducing node_4 at (2.0, 2.5), the structure forms two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4). This will improve stability and distribute forces. The load at node_3 will transfer to both node_1 and node_2 via node_4.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation is necessary for stability and optimal stress distribution. Adding node_4 above node_3 (at (2.0, 2.5)) creates two efficient load paths, splitting the applied force at node_3 between node_1 and node_2. The member from node_3 to node_4 will carry much of the vertical load, reducing stress in the bottom chord. Member areas are chosen to keep the maximum stress low while minimizing weight, using area_id \'2\' (0.782) for diagonals and \'3\' (1.759) for the bottom chord, balancing mass and stress.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Key assumptions: E = const, all members pin-jointed, only axial forces. Force balance at each node: sum Fx = 0, sum Fy = 0.

Estimate forces via method of joints. Choose area_id \'3\' for bottom chord (node_1-node_2), \'2\' for diagonals and verticals. Total mass = sum(length × area). Max stress = max(abs(force)/area).
