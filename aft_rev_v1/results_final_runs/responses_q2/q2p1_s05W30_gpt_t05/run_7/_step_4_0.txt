    "preamble": "The task is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio of a closed 2D truss, while keeping total mass ≤ 30 and stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 0.5. The current best structure achieves a stress-to-weight ratio of 0.2494, well within constraints. The truss is loaded at node_3, with supports at nodes 1, 2, and 3. The structure must remain closed and all nodes must be connected.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "The current structure is feasible and efficient, but the objective is to further minimize the stress-to-weight ratio if possible. The primary load is at node_3, which is on the bottom chord. Supports are at nodes 1 (pinned), 2 (roller), and 3 (roller), so the structure is statically determinate. Members use area_ids between 2 and 3, with one at 4. The mass is 25.86, which is below the 30 limit.",
    
    "analysis": "The current truss is a compact quadrilateral with a single top node (node_4) and three bottom nodes (nodes 1, 2, 3). Members connect all nodes, forming two triangles above the base and a closed web. The maximum stress is in member_2 (-6.45), which connects node_1 and node_3. The other members carry much lower stresses. Structure history shows that alternative geometries either increase mass or stress-to-weight ratio, or violate constraints. The current design already balances load efficiently, with a triangulated form and minimal mass.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "The pattern is that moving node_4 (the top node) up and/or laterally can affect load distribution and member forces. The lowest mass and stress-to-weight ratio are achieved with node_4 at (2.4, 2.8). Attempts to move node_4 closer to node_3 or higher up increase stress or mass. The current geometry is already close to optimal for the given constraints and loading.",
    
    "proposal": "Given the efficiency of the current design, I will attempt a minor optimization by slightly adjusting node_4's position to further reduce the maximum member stress. By moving node_4 slightly towards the centerline, I can balance the force in member_2 and possibly reduce the maximum stress without increasing mass. All supports and loaded nodes will remain fixed. All members will remain, but member area_ids will be reviewed for further mass reduction if possible.",
    
    "reasoning": "Symmetry and triangulation are key. The current design forms two strong triangles, but the load at node_3 causes high stress in member_2. By moving node_4 slightly towards the centroid of the base (nodes 1, 2, 3), the vertical component of force in member_2 can be reduced and redistributed to other members. Keeping area_ids at minimum sufficient values ensures mass is not increased. The structure remains closed and all nodes are connected.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Supports and loaded nodes fixed. Node_4 can move slightly. All members remain. Mass = sum(length × area). Maximum stress occurs in member_2; reducing its length or changing its angle should reduce its stress. Try node_4 at (2.6, 2.6). Recalculate member lengths and estimate new mass. Member area_ids: keep at '2' unless high stress requires '3'.",
    
    "calculation": "New node_4 at (2.6, 2.6):\n- member_1: node_1-node_2, length = 6.0, area_id='3', mass=6.0×1.759=10.554\n- member_2: node_1-node_3, length = 2.0, area_id='3', mass=2.0×1.759=3.518\n- member_3: node_2-node_3, length = 4.0, area_id='2', mass=4.0×0.782=3.128\n- member_4: node_1-node_4, length = sqrt(2.6²+2.6²)=3.677, area_id='2', mass=2.874\n- member_5: node_2-node_4, length = sqrt((6.0-2.6)²+2.6²)=4.083, area_id='2', mass=3.193\n- member_6: node_3-node_4, length = sqrt((2.0-2.6)²+2.6²)=2.669, area_id='2', mass=2.087\nTotal mass ≈ 25.35 (<30)\nStress: Moving node_4 slightly towards the center should reduce the force in member_2 by ~5-10%. Estimated new max stress ≈ 5.8 (from 6.45). New stress-to-weight ratio ≈ 0.229.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints satisfied. Structure remains closed. Mass is lower than before, and estimated stress-to-weight ratio is improved. Node positions are precise. All nodes are connected and no members are redundant.",
