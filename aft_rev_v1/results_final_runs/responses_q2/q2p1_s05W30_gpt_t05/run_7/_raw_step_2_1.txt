The current and historic designs do not meet the stress-to-weight constraint, despite mass being within limits.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs specify node positions, support and load locations, and member areas. The current structure fails the stress-to-weight constraint (0.5627 > 0.5), but mass is acceptable (22.50 < 30). The historic best structure also fails the ratio constraint (0.431) due to a high total mass (29.26). The load at node_3 is significant and off the support line, requiring effective triangulation for stability.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current truss is a basic quadrilateral with diagonals, using moderate to large member areas. The primary issue is that the most highly stressed member (member_2, -12.66) is not efficiently distributing load, and the structure is not optimally triangulated for the eccentric load at node_3. Both current and historic designs use node_4 as a top chord, but member sizing and node placement do not minimize the critical stress-to-weight ratio. The load at node_3 (angled -15, -30) demands a direct load path to supports, ideally via triangulated members. The use of area_id \'2\' and \'3\' is inefficient for lightly loaded members, while the most stressed member needs a larger area.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key issue: one member is overstressed relative to its area, raising the max stress-to-weight ratio. Diagonal bracing and more efficient area allocation are needed. Node_4\'s position may be suboptimal for load transfer. Potential to add a fifth node above node_3 to form a deeper truss and reduce maximum member force. Consider using a Warren or Pratt truss layout.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss by adjusting node_4\'s position (raising it and shifting slightly toward node_3) and adding a new node_5 above node_3 to improve triangulation. Reconnect members to provide direct load paths and distribute forces more evenly, and resize members based on expected force. Use smaller area_ids for lightly loaded members and larger ones for critical load paths.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By raising node_4 and introducing node_5, we create two triangles over the span, directly connecting the loaded node_3 to both supports and the upper nodes. This distributes the applied force more efficiently, reducing the peak force in any single member. Assigning larger areas to highly loaded members and smaller to others optimizes the stress-to-weight ratio and mass. The structure remains closed and all nodes are connected.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume node_1 (0,0) is pinned, node_2 (6,0) is roller, node_3 (2,0) is roller and loaded (-15,-30). Place node_4 at (3.0,2.8) (higher and more central than before) and add node_5 at (2.0,1.8) directly above node_3. Members: node_1–node_2, node_1–node_4, node_2–node_4, node_1–node_5, node_2–node_5, node_3–node_5, node_4–node_5, node_3–node_4, node_1–node_3. Assign area_id \'4\' (3.128) to main diagonals (node_3–node_4, node_3–node_5), area_id \'2\' (0.782) to verticals and upper chords, area_id \'1\' (0.195) to lightly loaded members.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Estimate member lengths and assign areas.

Assign area_id \'4\' to node_3–node_5 and node_3–node_4, area_id \'2\' to upper chords and verticals, \'1\' to node_1–node_2.
