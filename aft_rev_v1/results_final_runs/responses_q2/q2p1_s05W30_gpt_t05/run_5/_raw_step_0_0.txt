All nodes must be connected, and only specified area IDs are allowed. This is the initial, single-shot attempt at an optimal design.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "The three provided nodes are collinear along the x-axis: node_1 (0,0), node_3 (2,0), node_2 (6,0). All nodes are supported (node_1: pinned, node_2: roller, node_3: roller). A significant load acts at node_3 (-15, -30). To achieve a closed truss and triangulation, a new node above the x-axis is needed. The design must be lightweight, distribute load efficiently, and avoid excessive member forces.",\n\n    "analysis": "With all nodes collinear, a stable, closed truss is impossible without an additional node. Adding a node above the x-axis (e.g., at y=2.0) allows for triangulation, creating two triangles. The load at node_3 must be transferred efficiently to the supports. Placing the new node near the load application point and connecting all nodes forms two strong triangles, minimizing member lengths and maximizing structural efficiency. All members must be sized to keep stresses low and total mass under 30.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "The most effective closed truss is a simple triangle with an apex above the loaded node. This configuration shortens load paths, reduces member forces, and provides redundancy. The geometry should be as compact as possible to minimize member lengths and mass. Since the load is mostly vertical, the triangle should be vertically tall enough to reduce force magnitudes in the bottom chord. Area IDs must be assigned to members based on expected force magnitudes, using larger areas for highly loaded members.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Add a new node_4 at (3.0, 2.0), above the midpoint between node_3 and node_2. This allows for two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_3, node_2, node_4). Connect all nodes to node_4, forming a closed, triangulated truss. Members directly carrying the applied load (node_3–node_4, node_3–node_1, node_3–node_2) need larger areas. Diagonal and top members can be smaller. This configuration ensures all nodes are connected and load is efficiently distributed.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume all members are pin-jointed. Assign area IDs based on expected force: main load path members get larger areas, others smaller. Use geometry to calculate member lengths. Estimate member forces via static equilibrium (method of joints). Calculate mass as sum(length × area). Calculate stress = force/area for each member. Choose areas to ensure max(abs(stress))/total_weight ≤ 0.5 and total mass ≤ 30. Adjust area IDs iteratively if needed.",\n\n    "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1–node_3 = 2.0, node_3–node_2 = 4.0, node_1–node_4 = sqrt(3^2+2^2)=3.61, node_2–node_4 = sqrt(3^2+2^2)=3.61, node_3–node_4 = sqrt(1^2+2^2)=2.24. Assign area_id \'5\' (4.887) to node_3–node_4 (main load), \'2\' (0.782) to node_1–node_3, \'2\' to node_3–node_2, \'1\' (0.195) to node_1–node_4 and node_2–node_4. Mass = (2.0×0.782)+(4.0×0.782)+(3.61×0.195)+(3.61×0.195)+(2.24×4.887) ≈ 1.56+3.13+0.70+0.70+10.95 = 17.04. Estimate member forces: main vertical member (node_3–node_4) carries most vertical load (≈30), so force ≈30, stress = 30/4.887 ≈6.14. Max(abs(stress))/total_weight = 6.14/17.04 ≈0.36, which is within the constraint (≤0.5). All constraints satisfied.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "All nodes are connected, the structure is triangulated and closed, and load paths are efficient.
