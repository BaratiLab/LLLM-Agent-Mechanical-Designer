The main objective is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio (max(abs(stress))/total_weight), ensuring it does not exceed 0.5, and the total mass remains under 30. The design must be fully connected and satisfy all mechanical and geometric constraints.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three nodes in a non-collinear arrangement, with node_1 pinned, node_2 and node_3 on rollers, and a substantial force applied to node_3. The truss must be closed and fully connected. The challenge is to distribute the load efficiently, minimize maximum member stress, and keep the structure lightweight. Triangulation is necessary for stability.",\n\n    "analysis": "The nodes are at (0,0), (6,0), and (2,0), all on the x-axis, which means the structure is initially collinear and cannot resist vertical loads unless a new node is introduced above or below the x-axis. The load at node_3 is (-15,-30), creating both a horizontal and vertical component. Triangulation requires at least one node off-axis for vertical stability. To minimize mass and maximize efficiency, a single additional node above the x-axis (forming a triangle) will be most effective. Members will connect all nodes, forming a closed, triangulated truss. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2/node_3 (rollers) allow horizontal and vertical reactions as needed.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "The main concern is that the original nodes are collinear, so vertical stability is impossible without a new node. Adding a single node above the x-axis at a strategic location will allow for efficient load transfer and minimal member lengths. The new node should be positioned to minimize member forces, especially in those carrying the largest load components. Using the smallest feasible cross-sectional areas for most members, except those with the highest force, will help minimize mass.",\n\n    "reasoning": "To create an efficient, closed truss, I will add one node above the x-axis (say, at (2,2)), forming two triangles: (node_1, node_2, new_node) and (node_2, node_3, new_node). This allows the vertical load at node_3 to be carried through triangulation. All four nodes will be connected to ensure closure. Members will be sized based on estimated force magnitudes, with larger areas for the most highly stressed member (likely the one directly between node_3 and the new node).",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume the new node is at (2.0, 2.0). Members: node_1-node_2, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_1 (base triangle), plus node_1-new_node, node_2-new_node, node_3-new_node (vertical bracing). Calculate member lengths, estimate axial forces via method of joints (assuming pin-jointed truss and static equilibrium). Assign area_id values to keep mass under 30 and stress-to-weight ratio under 0.5. For simplicity, use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for less loaded members, and area_id \'5\' (4.887) for the most loaded member. Density assumed unity for mass calculation.",\n\n    "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_2: 6.00, node_2-node_3: 4.00, node_3-node_1: 2.00, node_1-new_node: sqrt((2-0)^2+(2-0)^2)=2.83, node_2-new_node: sqrt((6-2)^2+(0-2)^2)=4.47, node_3-new_node: sqrt((2-2)^2+(0-2)^2)=2.00. Total length = 6+4+2+2.83+4.47+2 = 21.3. Assign areas: node_1-node_2: \'2\', node_2-node_3: \'2\', node_3-node_1: \'2\', node_1-new_node: \'2\', node_2-new_node: \'2\', node_3-new_node: \'5\'. Mass = (6+4+2+2.83+4.47)*0.782 + 2*4.887 = 14.33 + 9.77 = 24.10 (<30). Estimate member forces: The largest will be in node_3-new_node due to direct vertical load. Assume max force = 30 (vertical component). Stress = 30/4.887 = 6.14. Stress-to-weight = 6.14/24.1 = 0.255 (<0.5). Constraints satisfied.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints are satisfied: mass < 30, stress-to-weight < 0.5, all nodes connected, closed triangulated truss.
