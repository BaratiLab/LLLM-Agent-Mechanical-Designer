    "preamble": "Given a 2D truss with three supported nodes (node_1: pinned, node_2 and node_3: roller) and a significant load at node_3, the current and historic designs consistently violate the stress-to-weight ratio constraint (>0.5). The objective is to generate a fully connected, closed truss with minimized stress-to-weight ratio and total mass, while strictly satisfying all constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "The structure must have max(abs(stress))/total_mass <= 0.5 and total_mass <= 30. Current and historic designs either have too high max stress or too little mass (overstressed), or are too heavy (inefficient). The load at node_3 is large and off-axis, so efficient triangulation and direct load paths are crucial.",
    
    "analysis": "The current design and most history variants use a central top node (node_4, e.g. at [3.0,2.5]) and various attempts at subdividing the top chord. However, the lower chord (nodes_1, 2, 3) is almost collinear, and the main load at node_3 causes excessive force in the short member_5 (node_1-node_3). This member is consistently overstressed. Attempts to reduce member area lead to constraint violations, while increasing area increases mass. Designs with more top nodes (e.g., nodes_4,5,6) are too heavy. The best historic design in terms of stress-to-weight ratio is still above 0.5. The main issue is the direct transfer of a large vertical load into a short, nearly horizontal member, which is inefficient.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Key pattern: The short span between node_1 and node_3 (with the load) is problematic. Overstressing is persistent. Adding more nodes to the top chord increases mass without relieving the critical member. The structure needs a more direct and efficient path to transfer the load at node_3 to the supports, ideally by triangulation and possibly by raising node_3 slightly to break collinearity, or by adding a new top node closer to node_3. All supports and loaded nodes must remain fixed.",
    
    "proposal": "Redesign the truss by adding a single top node (node_4) directly above node_3 to create two efficient triangles: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_3-node_2-node_4. This creates short, steep diagonals which efficiently resolve the vertical load. All nodes are connected (closed truss). Member areas are chosen to keep mass low but stresses below the limit. This minimal, symmetric Pratt truss will efficiently transfer loads and minimize overstressed members.",
    
    "reasoning": "By placing node_4 directly above node_3 (at [2.0, 2.5]), the vertical component of the load at node_3 is carried almost entirely by the diagonals node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4, reducing excessive force in the short lower chord. Triangulation ensures each member is primarily in tension or compression, minimizing bending. Member areas are chosen to balance mass and stress. This geometry is a classic solution for a point load at a midspan node.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All supports and loaded nodes are fixed. Area_id '2' (area=0.782) is used for diagonals and top chord, as it balances mass and stress. Lower chord members may need area_id '3' (area=1.759) if they still approach the stress limit. Calculate member lengths and estimate forces using simple statics: vertical load at node_3 is split between the two diagonals, which carry the load to the supports. Member mass = length × area.",
    
    "calculation": "Node positions: node_1 (0.0,0.0), node_2 (6.0,0.0), node_3 (2.0,0.0), node_4 (2.0,2.5). Members: (1) node_1-node_3 (lower chord), (2) node_3-node_2 (lower chord), (3) node_1-node_4 (diagonal), (4) node_2-node_4 (diagonal), (5) node_3-node_4 (vertical), (6) node_1-node_2 (bottom chord), (7) node_4-node_2 (top chord). Lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_2 = 4.0, node_1-node_4 = sqrt(2^2 + 2.5^2) ≈ 3.20, node_2-node_4 = sqrt(4^2 + 2.5^2) ≈ 4.72, node_3-node_4 = 2.5, node_1-node_2 = 6.0. Use area_id '2' for all except node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2, which get area_id '3' if needed. Total mass estimate: (2.0+4.0+3.20+4.72+2.5+6.0) × 0.782 ≈ 17.45 (if all area_id '2'); using area_id '3' (1.759) for two lower chords: (2.0+4.0)×1.759 + (3.20+4.72+2.5+6.0)×0.782 ≈ 3.52+7.04+11.13 ≈ 21.69. Max stress is split between diagonals, likely below 10, so ratio < 0.5. This should satisfy constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Verify: All nodes are connected. No isolated nodes. Supports and load nodes unchanged. All member areas are chosen to keep mass below 30, and stress-to-weight ratio below 0.5. Geometry is efficient. Ready to output structure.",
