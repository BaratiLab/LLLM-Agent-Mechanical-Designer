The current and historic designs fail to meet the stress-to-weight constraint, mainly due to high stresses in main load paths and inefficient member sizing. The goal is to redesign the truss to satisfy all constraints while maintaining a closed, fully connected structure.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs specify a concentrated load at node_3, supports at nodes 1, 2, and 3 (pinned/roller), and a requirement for a closed truss. The current structure is light but overstressed, while heavier historic structures are inefficient. A new, more efficient triangulated configuration is needed.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current structure (iteration 12) has a stress-to-weight ratio of 1.0113 (>0.5), failing the constraint. The principal failure mode is excessive stress in the main horizontal members (especially member_1: -15.6) due to the direct path from the loaded node to the supports. Historic designs with more nodes and members reduce stresses but are overly heavy. The best historic ratio is 0.2779, but with a high mass (23.39). Patterns show that stress is best reduced by distributing the load via more triangulation and using efficient member sizes. The vertical and diagonal members are critical in distributing the load from node_3 upward and sideways to the supports. A more symmetric, triangulated, and compact geometry should improve stress distribution and reduce peak force in any single member.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce the stress-to-weight ratio, the truss must better distribute the load from node_3. This can be achieved by raising the top chord, introducing a central top node, and using more efficient diagonal bracing. Using minimal area members for less-stressed regions and larger areas only where needed will control mass. Avoiding excessive spans for any single member will also help.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the structure as a symmetric, closed Warren truss with a central top node. Nodes 1, 2, and 3 remain fixed (as supports/loads). Add nodes at (1.5, 2.2), (3.0, 2.8), and (4.5, 2.2) to create a compact, highly triangulated geometry. Use minimal area members for non-critical paths and upsize only where high stress is expected. This configuration will efficiently distribute the load, minimize peak member force, and keep mass low.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A Warren truss with a central top node provides direct load paths and triangulation, minimizing bending and distributing forces efficiently. The load at node_3 will be carried up to the apex (node_6) and then split symmetrically to both supports. Diagonals reduce unsupported member length, and member areas are chosen based on estimated force paths. This approach ensures all nodes are connected and stress is distributed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Area_id \'2\' (0.782) for diagonals and top chord, \'1\' (0.195) for less-stressed verticals. Main bottom chord (node_1-node_2) may use \'2\' or \'3\' if needed, but start with \'2\'. Estimate: Main diagonals and top chord carry highest force; verticals and short diagonals carry less. Calculate member lengths, estimate forces (using symmetry and equilibrium), and sum mass. Adjust areas if stress >0.5 × total mass.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node positions: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0) (fixed). node_4 (1.5,2.2), node_5 (4.5,2.2), node_6 (3.0,2.8). Members: bottom chord (node_1-node_2, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_1), verticals (node_3-node_6), top chord (node_4-node_6-node_5), diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_4-node_6, node_6-node_5). Member lengths calculated via distance formula. Total mass = sum(length × area). Estimate max stress: Load at node_3 is split through diagonals to node_6 and then to node_1/node_2. With increased triangulation, no member should see >6 (from historic data). For area_id \'2\', mass per member is moderate.
