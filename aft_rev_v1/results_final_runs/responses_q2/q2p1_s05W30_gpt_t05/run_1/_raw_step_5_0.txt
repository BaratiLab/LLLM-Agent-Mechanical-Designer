The current and historical designs are overbuilt and overweight, failing the mass constraint. The objective is to create a feasible, efficient, and closed truss that meets all requirements.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The structure must support a significant load at node_3, with supports at nodes 1 (pinned), 2 (roller), and 3 (roller). The main challenge is reducing mass while maintaining structural integrity and keeping max stress-to-weight ratio below 0.5. Current and prior attempts are too heavy or overstressed.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current and historic trusses use many members and large cross-sections, resulting in high mass. The load at node_3 is sizable and off-center, requiring effective force distribution. Previous attempts with fewer members failed due to overstress, while heavier designs failed due to mass. The key is to use triangulation efficiently, minimize member lengths, and select the smallest allowable cross-sections that keep stresses within limits. The boundary conditions (supports and load) are fixed, so node movement is only possible for intermediate nodes. The best solution is likely a compact, triangular or trapezoidal truss with short, direct load paths.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Prior designs either had too much mass (overbuilt) or too much stress (underbuilt). The optimal balance is likely with 5 nodes, including two intermediate top nodes forming a triangle above the base. These nodes should be placed to minimize member length while ensuring efficient load transfer from node_3 to supports. Use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for most members, as it offers a good balance between strength and mass. Only increase area if stress calculations require it.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss to use a compact, efficient Warren or Pratt configuration with five nodes: the three original supported nodes (unchanged), and two top nodes positioned symmetrically above the base, spaced to minimize member length and maximize triangulation. Connect all nodes to form a closed, triangulated structure. Use area_id \'2\' for all members unless calculations indicate a need for larger area.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A triangular/trapezoidal truss with two top nodes (forming a \'roof\') above node_3, connected to all base nodes, will efficiently distribute the load. Shorter members reduce mass and stress, while triangulation prevents mechanism formation. Symmetry about the midspan (x=3.0) ensures balanced force paths and efficient use of material. All nodes are connected to at least two others, ensuring a closed structure.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Steel material, allowable stress set for area_id \'2\' based on previous member stresses in history. Members will be checked for stress using force balance (joints method). Member lengths and total mass are calculated using geometry. If any member exceeds allowable stress, increase area_id only for that member. Node positions: node_4 at (1.5, 2.2), node_5 at (4.5, 2.2) — these are close to the best-performing light-weight historic structures but raised slightly to reduce member length and improve triangulation. All member connections are planned to ensure closure and triangulation.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: base (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2) = 2.0m and 4.0m. Top chords (node_4-node_5) = 3.0m. Diagonals and verticals calculated using Pythagoras. Estimated total member length ≈ 18.5m. With area_id \'2\' (0.782), total mass ≈ 14.46 (well below 30). Estimated max stress in most critical member (bottom chord near node_3) ≈ 7.0 (from history), so stress-to-weight ratio ≈ 7/14.46 ≈ 0.48, satisfying the 0.5 constraint. If final stress exceeds this, increase area_id for that member only.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "All nodes are connected, structure is closed and triangulated, supports and load nodes are unchanged, estimated mass and stress-to-weight ratio meet constraints. All area_ids are \'2\' except if a member is found to be overstressed. Final check: total mass ≈ 14.5 < 30, stress-to-weight ratio ≈ 0.48 < 0.5.
