The current and all historic designs violate the stress-to-weight constraint (must be ≤ 0.5), with the best so far at 0.991. The objective is to deliver a fully constraint-compliant, efficient structure.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs clarify: three supported nodes (node_1: pinned, node_2: roller, node_3: roller), a concentrated load at node_3, and a history of over-stressed or over-weight trusses. The truss must be closed, all nodes connected, and use only allowed cross-sectional areas. Node positions with supports/loads are fixed.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current and historic trusses use a five-node, two-panel (Warren-type) arrangement, but all fail the stress-to-weight constraint. Most stress is concentrated in bottom chord members (notably member_1: -15.43). Increasing member area to lower stress increases mass, which is already near half the allowed maximum. Designs with more panels or verticals (histories 1,2) are even heavier, while minimal trusses (history 3,4) still exceed the stress ratio. The current design is close to feasible but needs better load distribution and triangulation. The main issue is excessive force in the lower chord due to insufficient triangulation and inefficient load transfer.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key pattern: stress is highest in the lower chord between node_1 and node_3. Stress is distributed inefficiently due to the flat lower chord and shallow height of the truss. Increasing the truss height at midspan and introducing a central top node (vertical) will reduce member forces and allow use of smaller cross-sectional areas. Efficient triangulation (Pratt or Howe truss) is likely to yield a compliant design.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the structure by adding a central top node (node_6) above node_3, forming a two-panel Pratt truss. Connect all lower nodes to node_6 with diagonals, creating a more efficient force path. Use the smallest area that keeps stress within limits. Retain all support and load node positions as required.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A central top node (node_6) at (3.0, h) will increase the truss height, reducing axial forces in the bottom chord and diagonals. This allows use of area_id \'1\' or \'2\' for most members, minimizing mass. The Pratt configuration efficiently transfers vertical loads to supports through short, direct members. All nodes will be connected, forming a closed truss. Node_6\'s y-coordinate will be chosen to maximize height without excessive member lengths (e.g., h=2.8).",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume: Steel, all members axially loaded. Place node_6 at (3.0, 2.8). Member list: bottom chord (node_1-node_3-node_2), top chord (node_4-node_6-node_5), verticals (node_3-node_6), diagonals (node_1-node_6, node_2-node_6, node_4-node_3, node_5-node_3). Use area_id \'1\' for diagonals/verticals, \'2\' for chords if needed. Calculate member lengths and estimate forces: with increased height, expect maximum force in bottom chord to drop by ~50%, allowing stress-to-weight ratio <0.5. Estimate mass: total length × area (area_id \'1\' = 0.195, \'2\' = 0.782).",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: bottom chord (node_1-node_3: 2.0m, node_3-node_2: 4.0m), top chord (node_4-node_6: ~1.80m, node_6-node_5: ~1.80m), vertical (node_3-node_6: 2.8m), diagonals (node_1-node_6: ~4.12m, node_2-node_6: ~4.12m, node_4-node_3: ~2.2m, node_5-node_3: ~2.2m). Total length ≈ 2+4+1.8+1.8+2.8+4.12+4.12+2.2+2.2 ≈ 25m. Using mostly area_id \'1\' (0.195) except chords (area_id \'2\'), total mass ≈ (6m × 0.782) + (19m × 0.195) ≈ 4.692 + 3.705 ≈ 8.4 < 30.
