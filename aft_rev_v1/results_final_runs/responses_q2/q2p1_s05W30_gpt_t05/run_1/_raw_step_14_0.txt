The objective is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio while keeping the total mass below 30 units, using only valid cross-sectional areas, and ensuring a fully connected (closed) truss. Node positions for supports and load must remain fixed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The main constraints are stress-to-weight ratio <= 0.5 and total mass <= 30. The current and all historic structures violate the stress-to-weight ratio constraint, mostly due to high stress in members directly affected by the load at node_3. The load is substantial and eccentric, requiring efficient triangulation and member sizing. The design must remain closed and all nodes must be structurally connected.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current and historic structures show that excessive stress accumulates in the bottom chord members (especially those from node_1 to node_3) due to the large downward and leftward force at node_3. Attempts to reduce mass by using smaller areas increase stress, while increasing areas to reduce stress raises mass. The best historic structure (rank_1) has a low stress-to-weight ratio but is extremely heavy (mass > 23), showing a trade-off. Topologies with more direct triangulation between supports and the loaded node, and with short load paths, perform better. The most recent structure (iteration 13) is close to the mass constraint but fails the stress ratio constraint, indicating the need for better load distribution and/or selective up-sizing of critical members.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: High stress is always in the member from node_1 to node_3. Adding more triangles and direct diagonals from the supports to the top nodes reduces the force in the bottom chords. Increasing the height of the truss above node_3 (i.e., raising the top nodes) can reduce member forces. Ensuring the loaded node is well-braced (multiple triangles converging) is key. Using the smallest area for non-critical members and up-sizing only the most stressed members may yield a feasible design.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss by raising the top chord nodes to increase the truss height, which reduces force in the bottom chords. Add a central top node above node_3 to create two strong triangles converging at node_3. Use larger area for the highly stressed member (node_1 to node_3), and minimal area for less stressed ones. All nodes will remain connected, and supports/loads remain fixed. The new node layout will be: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (4,0), node_5 (3,2.7) (top center node). Members will form two main triangles: node_1–node_3–node_5, node_2–node_4–node_5, plus bracing.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Raising the top node (node_5) above the loaded node_3 creates a pair of deep triangles, efficiently distributing the applied load to both supports. This configuration minimizes the force in the horizontal bottom chord by maximizing the lever arm. The nodes at (0,0), (2,0), (4,0), and (6,0) allow for a symmetric, braced structure. Using a large area for member node_1–node_3, and node_3–node_5, and minimal area elsewhere, balances mass and stress. All nodes are connected, creating a closed truss.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Area \'4\' (3.128) for member node_1–node_3, area \'2\' (0.782) for most other members, area \'3\' (1.759) for diagonals from supports to node_5. Estimated member lengths: node_1–node_3 (2), node_3–node_5 (sqrt(2^2 + 2.7^2) ≈ 3.36), node_1–node_5 (sqrt(3^2 + 2.7^2) ≈ 4.03), node_2–node_5 (sqrt(3^2 + 2.7^2)), node_4–node_5 (sqrt(1^2 + 2.7^2) ≈ 2.88), node_3–node_4 (2), node_4–node_2 (2), node_3–node_4 (2). Mass calculation: sum(length × area). Estimate max stress in node_1–node_3 and node_3–node_5 as they take most of the load. By increasing height and triangulation, expect to reduce max stress to below 15, yielding a ratio below 0.5 for total mass ≈ 18–22.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1–node_3 (2.00), node_3–node_4 (2.00), node_1–node_5 (4.03), node_2–node_5 (4.03), node_3–node_5 (3.36), node_4–node_5 (2.88), node_2–node_4 (2.00).

Mass: (2×3.128)+(3.36×3.128)+(4.03×0.782)+(4.03×0.782)+(2.88×0.782)+(2×0.782)+(2×0.782) ≈ 6.26+10.52+3.15+3.15+2.25+1.56+1.56 = 28.45.
