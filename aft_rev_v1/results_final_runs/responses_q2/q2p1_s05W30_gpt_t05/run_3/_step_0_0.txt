    "preamble": "Design a fully connected, minimal-mass 2D truss using three given nodes and three supports, with a downward and leftward load at node_3. The goal is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio, ensuring all constraints on stress, mass, and connectivity are satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three nodes on the x-axis, with a significant off-axis load at node_3. Supports at all nodes (pinned at node_1, rollers at node_2 and node_3). Objective is to create a closed, triangulated truss to efficiently distribute load and minimize member stresses and weight. The structure must be fully connected, with all nodes participating in load transfer.",
    
    "analysis": "The nodes form a straight line (0,0), (2,0), (6,0). The load at node_3 is (-15, -30), i.e., leftward and downward. With all supports on the x-axis, out-of-plane buckling is not a concern, but in-plane stability is. A triangle is the most efficient closed structure for three nodes. Direct connections between all pairs (fully connected triangle) will ensure load paths are short and direct, minimizing maximum member force. The member between node_1 and node_3 will take significant load, so its area must be sufficient to limit stress. The member between node_2 and node_3 will also be heavily loaded. The member between node_1 and node_2 will mostly stabilize the structure. The mass constraint (<=30) allows some flexibility for area selection, but the stress-to-weight ratio (<=0.5) is tight, requiring careful sizing.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation is optimal for three nodes. Using the smallest possible areas for lightly loaded members and larger areas for heavily loaded members will optimize the stress-to-weight ratio. The load at node_3 will induce compression/tension in both node_1-node_3 and node_2-node_3 members. The member node_1-node_2 can be sized smaller. All nodes are supported, so global stability is ensured.",
    
    "reasoning": "A fully connected triangle (node_1-node_2, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_3) is optimal. Assign the largest area to the most heavily loaded member (node_1-node_3), a moderate area to node_2-node_3, and the smallest area to node_1-node_2. This balances mass and stress. Use direct trigonometric calculation to estimate member forces from the applied load, assuming pin-jointed nodes and static equilibrium.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All members are pin-jointed, loads are statically applied, and supports are ideal. Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_2 = 6.0, node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_2-node_3 = 4.0. Assign area IDs: node_1-node_3 gets '5' (A=4.887), node_2-node_3 gets '4' (A=3.128), node_1-node_2 gets '1' (A=0.195). Estimate forces using method of joints: node_3 sees (-15, -30). The geometry means node_1-node_3 and node_2-node_3 share the vertical and horizontal components. Calculate max stress as force/area, total weight as sum(length*area). Check constraints.",
    
    "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_2 = 6.00, node_1-node_3 = 2.00, node_2-node_3 = 4.00. Areas: 4.887, 3.128, 0.195. Total mass = 6.00*0.195 + 2.00*4.887 + 4.00*3.128 = 1.17 + 9.77 + 12.51 = 23.45 < 30. Estimate member forces at node_3: resolve (-15, -30) into directions of members. For node_3, joint equilibrium: Let F13 (node_1-node_3), F23 (node_2-node_3). Angles: node_1-node_3 is horizontal (left), node_2-node_3 is rightward (4 units). By geometry: node_1 at (0,0), node_2 at (6,0), node_3 at (2,0). So, node_1-node_3: dx=-2, dy=0; node_2-node_3: dx=4, dy=0. But all nodes are collinear, so a triangle can't be formed unless a new node is introduced for triangulation. To close the structure, add a new node above the x-axis (e.g., node_4 at (3.0, 2.0)), connect all nodes to node_4, forming two triangles. Recalculate: Add node_4 (3.0, 2.0). New members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4. Member lengths: node_1-node_4 = sqrt(9+4) = 3.61, node_2-node_4 = sqrt(9+4) = 3.61, node_3-node_4 = sqrt(1+4) = 2.24. Assign area IDs: node_3-node_4 '5' (4.887), node_2-node_4 '3' (1.759), node_1-node_4 '3' (1.759). Mass: 2.24*4.887 + 3.61*1.759*2 = 10.95 + 12.71 = 23.66 < 30. Estimate max force in node_3-node_4: F = sqrt(15^2+30^2) = 33.54. Stress = 33.54/4.887 = 6.86. Stress-to-weight ratio = 6.86/23.66 = 0.29 < 0.5. All constraints satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Final structure: nodes at (0.0,0.0), (6.0,0.0), (2.0,0.0), and new node at (3.0,2.0) for triangulation and closure. Members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4. Heaviest member (node_3-node_4) sized largest. All nodes connected, all constraints satisfied. No duplicate nodes, all connections unique.",
