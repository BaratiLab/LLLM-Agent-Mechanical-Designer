    "preamble": "This task is to design a closed, optimized 2D truss using three given nodes, specific support and load conditions, and a discrete set of cross-sectional areas. The objective is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio (max(abs(stress))/total_weight) while ensuring the structure is fully connected, all constraints are met, and the total mass does not exceed 30 units.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs: Three nodes in a straight line, with node_1 at (0,0), node_2 at (6,0), node_3 at (2,0). Node_1 is pinned, node_2 and node_3 are rollers. A significant load is applied at node_3. Truss must be closed (all nodes connected), total mass <= 30, stress-to-weight ratio <= 0.5. Only specified area_ids allowed.",
    
    "analysis": "The three nodes are collinear, which means a basic triangle cannot be formed unless a new node is introduced off the line. If only these three nodes are used, the truss is a single line, which is structurally unstable (mechanism, not a truss). To create a stable, closed truss, a fourth node must be introduced above or below the line to form two triangles. The load at node_3 is significant and off-axis, so the new node should be placed to optimize load transfer and minimize member forces. The supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2/node_3 (roller) require that the truss resist both vertical and horizontal forces.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Key insight: Minimum stable truss is a triangle; current nodes are collinear so a new node is necessary. Placing the new node above the line (say, at y=2.0) between node_1 and node_2 creates two strong triangles. Symmetry and direct load paths are prioritized to minimize member forces. The new node should be near the vertical projection of the load for efficient force transfer.",
    
    "reasoning": "Introduce node_4 at (2.5, 2.0): this is above the center of the bottom chord, creating two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_3, node_2, node_4). Connect all nodes to ensure closure. This configuration efficiently distributes the load at node_3 to both supports, uses short members for weight efficiency, and keeps the structure fully triangulated. Assign larger area_ids to members expected to carry higher forces (bottom chords), and smaller ones to diagonals.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Truss is pin-jointed, loaded only at nodes. Members only take axial force. Areas chosen to keep mass below 30 and stress-to-weight ratio below 0.5. Estimate member forces using static equilibrium and geometry. Mass = sum(member_length * area). Assign area_ids: bottom chord gets higher area, diagonals and top chord get smaller. Calculate all member lengths, estimate max force (from load and geometry), check stresses (force/area), and compute total mass.",
    
    "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3: 2.0, node_3-node_2: 4.0, node_1-node_4: sqrt((2.5-0)^2 + (2-0)^2)=3.20, node_2-node_4: sqrt((6-2.5)^2 + (0-2)^2)=4.03, node_3-node_4: sqrt((2.5-2)^2 + (2-0)^2)=2.06. Assign area_ids: bottom chords (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2): '6' (7.037), diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4): '2' (0.782), vertical (node_3-node_4): '3' (1.759). Mass: (2*7.037)+(4*7.037)+(3.20*0.782)+(4.03*0.782)+(2.06*1.759)=14.07+28.15+2.50+3.15+3.62=51.49 (too high). Reduce areas: bottom chords to '2' (0.782), diagonals to '1' (0.195), vertical to '2' (0.782). New mass: (2*0.782)+(4*0.782)+(3.20*0.195)+(4.03*0.195)+(2.06*0.782)=1.56+3.13+0.62+0.79+1.61=7.71. Estimate max member force as ~35 (worst case, from geometry and load), so max stress: 35/0.782=44.8, stress-to-weight ratio=44.8/7.71=5.8 (>0.5). Increase bottom chords to '4' (3.128). Mass: (2*3.128)+(4*3.128)+(3.20*0.195)+(4.03*0.195)+(2.06*0.782)=6.26+12.51+0.62+0.79+1.61=21.79. Max stress: 35/3.128=11.2, ratio=11.2/21.79=0.51. Slightly above limit. Try bottom chords '5' (4.887): mass=(2*4.887)+(4*4.887)+(3.20*0.195)+(4.03*0.195)+(2.06*0.782)=9.77+19.55+0.62+0.79+1.61=32.34 (>30). Try bottom chords '4', vertical '3' (1.759): mass=(2*3.128)+(4*3.128)+(3.20*0.195)+(4.03*0.195)+(2.06*1.759)=6.26+12.51+0.62+0.79+3.62=23.8. Max stress: bottom chord 35/3.128=11.2, vertical 30/1.759=17.06, ratio=17.06/23.8=0.72. Try vertical '4' (3.128): mass=(2*3.128)+(4*3.128)+(3.20*0.195)+(4.03*0.195)+(2.06*3.128)=6.26+12.51+0.62+0.79+6.44=26.62. Max stress: 30/3.128=9.59, ratio=9.59/26.62=0.36. All constraints satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Design uses a new node_4 at (2.5, 2.0) to form two triangles. All members and nodes are unique and referenced. Area_ids are chosen to keep mass below 30 and stress-to-weight ratio below 0.5. All constraints are satisfied. Structure is closed, connected, and optimized for stress-to-weight ratio.",
