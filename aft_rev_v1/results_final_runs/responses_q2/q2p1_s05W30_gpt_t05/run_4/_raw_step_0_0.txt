The objective is to create a closed, fully connected truss with minimal stress-to-weight ratio, while ensuring stress-to-weight ≤ 0.5 and total mass ≤ 30. All nodes must be connected, and member areas are chosen from a discrete set. The design must be fully justified and ready for parsing.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs provide three colinear nodes: node_1 (pinned, left), node_2 (roller, right), node_3 (roller, middle). A load acts at node_3 at an angle. The structure must be closed and connected. The challenge is to distribute the load efficiently and avoid high stress in any member, while keeping weight low.",\n    \n    "analysis": "With only three colinear nodes, a simple triangle is the only way to close the structure. The load at node_3 is both horizontal and vertical, so direct load paths from node_3 to both supports are essential. A triangle connecting all three nodes will ensure stability. The member between node_1 and node_2 will act as a tie, while the other two members will transfer the load from node_3. Highest stress will likely occur in the members directly connected to node_3, especially given the load\'s magnitude and direction. The mass must be minimized, so member areas should be as small as possible without exceeding the stress-to-weight constraint.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Colinear nodes mean the truss will be a straight-line triangle, with all members overlapping the base. The load at node_3 is likely to induce significant axial force in both node_1-node_3 and node_2-node_3 members. The base member (node_1-node_2) will mainly be in tension or compression, depending on load direction. Member areas must be chosen to balance mass and stress. Use the smallest possible area IDs that satisfy the stress constraint.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "To minimize stress-to-weight, use the smallest area that keeps max(abs(stress))/total_weight ≤ 0.5. Since all nodes are colinear, no new nodes are needed. The triangle is degenerate (flat), but still statically determinate and closed. Each member will be assigned an area based on estimated axial force. The most loaded member will dictate the minimum area. The base member can be smaller if it sees less force.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume E (Young\'s modulus) and density are constant and cancel in the ratio. Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_2 = 6.0m, node_1-node_3 = 2.0m, node_2-node_3 = 4.0m. Resolve the load at node_3: (-15, -30) kN. The geometry is simple, so use static equilibrium to estimate axial forces. Assign area IDs, calculate stresses (F/A), total weight (sum(length*area)), and the stress-to-weight ratio.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: L_12=6.00m, L_13=2.00m, L_23=4.00m.

Estimate forces: node_3 sees -15kN (x), -30kN (y). The triangle is flat, so members to node_3 take most of the load. Assume member_2 and member_3 split the load based on their lengths. Approximate member_2: F ≈ sqrt(15^2 + 30^2) * (2/6) ≈ 11.18kN; member_3: F ≈ sqrt(15^2 + 30^2) * (4/6) ≈ 22.36kN. Stresses: member_2 = 11.18/3.128 ≈ 3.58 kN/m^2, member_3 = 22.36/1.759 ≈ 12.72 kN/m^2, member_1 (tie) ≈ 0. Total mass = 6*0.782 + 2*3.128 + 4*1.759 = 4.692 + 6.256 + 7.036 = 17.98 < 30. Max stress = 12.72, ratio = 12.72/17.98 ≈ 0.71 > 0.5. Increase member_3 area to \'5\' (4.887): new mass = 6*0.782 + 2*3.128 + 4*4.887 = 4.692 + 6.256 + 19.548 = 30.496 (slightly > 30).
