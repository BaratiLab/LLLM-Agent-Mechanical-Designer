  "preamble": "The current truss structure at iteration 0/25 fails the stress-to-weight ratio constraint (1.1543 > 1.0) despite total mass being acceptable (14.225 < 30). The goal is to generate a closed 2D truss that satisfies all constraints by minimizing stress-to-weight ratio while maintaining or improving mass efficiency.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Initial design has 4 nodes with one load applied at node_3 and supports at nodes 1 (pinned), 2 (roller), and 3 (roller). Members connect nodes to form a partial triangular framework but lack full triangulation and redundancy. Current max stress is 16.42 with member_1 highly stressed in compression. Mass distribution is uneven with member_2 being heaviest.",
  "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-15, -30) induces large compressive stress on member_1 (node_1-node_3) and relatively low stress on others. Support at node_3 as roller limits vertical reaction, increasing stress in member_1. Member_2 (node_3-node_2) has low stress but high mass, indicating inefficiency. The structure is not fully triangulated, especially between node_2 and node_4, risking instability and uneven load paths. Member areas are unevenly distributed, with heavier members where stress is low. The structure is not closed with full triangulation, reducing stiffness and load distribution efficiency.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "The primary stress bottleneck is member_1 under compression. Member_2's large area is not justified by stress, suggesting resizing. Node_3's roller support limits vertical reactions, concentrating load on member_1. Adding additional members to form full triangulation and redistributing member areas can reduce peak stress and improve load paths. Node positions could be adjusted slightly to improve geometry without moving loaded or supported nodes. A closed truss with diagonal members between node_2 and node_4 and possibly adding a new node to form multiple triangles will enhance stability and reduce stress concentration.",
  "proposal": "Redesign the truss to form a fully triangulated closed structure by adding a new node above node_4 to create two triangular substructures, improving load distribution. Retain existing nodes with loads/supports fixed. Add members connecting node_2 and node_4, node_2 and new node, node_4 and new node, and node_3 and new node to form a stable closed polygon. Optimize member areas by reducing oversized members and increasing areas on highly stressed members. Adjust node_4 position slightly upward to improve geometry and load transfer.",
  "reasoning": "Triangulation is critical for stability and minimizing stress peaks. Adding a fifth node above node_4 creates a more efficient truss shape with multiple load paths. This reduces stress on member_1 by sharing load through new members. Optimizing member areas to match stress demands reduces mass and stress-to-weight ratio. Keeping supports and load nodes fixed ensures boundary conditions remain valid. Slight repositioning of node_4 upwards improves angles and reduces bending moments. Using area_id values from the given set allows precise mass control.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic behavior, uniform material properties, and axial forces only. Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance. Member mass = length × area (area from area_id). Stress proportional to axial force / area. Target max stress-to-weight ratio <= 1.0. Use smaller area_id for low-stress members, larger for high-stress. Node_4 moved from (2.0,3.5) to (2.0,4.0) for better geometry. New node_5 at (4.0,4.0) to form upper triangle. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_4-node_2, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_3-node_5. Calculate member lengths and assign areas to balance stress and mass.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Final design is closed, fully triangulated with 5 nodes and 8 members. Supports and load nodes fixed. Member areas selected to balance stress and mass.
