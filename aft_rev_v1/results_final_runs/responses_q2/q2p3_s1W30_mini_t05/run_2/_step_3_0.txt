    "preamble": "Optimize a 2D truss with 4 nodes under given loads and supports, minimizing stress-to-weight ratio while satisfying constraints. Current best design has ratio 0.945; aim to improve using history and node adjustments without changing support/load nodes.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Current design has node_4 at (3.5,3.7) with members sized mostly area '2' or '1'. Load at node_3 downward-left, supports fix nodes 1,2,3. Constraints: max stress-to-weight ≤1.0, total mass ≤30. History shows a better design with node_4 at (3.5,4.0) and member_1 area '3' reducing ratio to 0.54 but with slightly higher mass (~13.1).",
    "analysis": "Current structure is stable and closed with 6 members forming a quadrilateral with diagonal members. Load at node_3 induces compression in member_1 and tension in member_2. The highest stress occurs in member_1, suggesting it controls max stress. Member areas in current design are moderate but increasing member_1 area from '2' to '3' in history reduced max stress significantly and improved ratio. Node_4 vertical position influences load path and stress distribution. The pinned and roller supports constrain horizontal and vertical displacements adequately. The history shows that increasing node_4 height to 4.0m and increasing member_1 area to '3' yields better stress distribution and lower ratio. Member_6 area reduction from '2' to '1' also reduces mass while maintaining stability.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: increasing node_4 height slightly improves load transfer and reduces stress in critical members. Increasing area in highly stressed member_1 is effective. Reducing area in less stressed members like member_6 saves mass. The best historic design uses these principles. Current design can be improved by adopting these changes. No floating nodes or disconnected members. Constraint margins are respected in historic best design.",
    "proposal": "Adopt the rank_1 historic structure with node_4 at (3.5,4.0), member_1 area '3', member_6 area '1', and other members as in rank_1. This structure has a significantly improved stress-to-weight ratio (0.54) and total mass (13.11) well within constraints. No node repositioning for supports or load nodes to maintain boundary conditions.",
    "reasoning": "Load at node_3 induces compression in member_1; increasing its area reduces stress. Raising node_4 increases truss height, improving triangulation and load distribution. Reducing member_6 area reduces mass without increasing stress beyond limits. This design balances mass and strength optimally. Symmetry and triangulation principles guide member layout and node placement.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: uniform material, stress proportional to force/area, mass proportional to member length × area. Calculate member lengths from node coordinates, assign areas per area_id, compute member masses, sum total mass, calculate member forces from equilibrium, determine max stress, compute ratio. Check constraints: ratio ≤1.0, mass ≤30. Use geometry to confirm closed structure and connectivity.",
    "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_4 at (3.5,4.0). Members: member_1 area '3' (1.759), member_2 area '2' (0.782), member_3 area '2' (0.782), member_4 area '1' (0.195), member_5 area '1' (0.195), member_6 area '1' (0.195). Compute member lengths: member_1 (node_1 to node_3): 2.0m, member_2 (node_2 to node_3): 4.0m, member_3 (node_3 to node_4): approx 4.03m, member_4 (node_1 to node_4): approx 5.44m, member_5 (node_2 to node_4): approx 2.69m, member_6 (node_1 to node_2): 6.0m. Member masses calculated as length × area. Sum mass approx 13.11. Max stress from member_1 approx -7.08, ratio approx 0.54. Constraints met.",
    "scratch_pad_final": "Final design meets constraints with margin. Uses proven historic best structure. No unsupported nodes or disconnected members. Node_4 repositioned only within allowed limits. Member areas chosen from allowed set. Stress-to-weight ratio improved significantly from 0.945 to 0.54. Mass well below 30. Ready to finalize.",
