Current design satisfies constraints with stress-to-weight ratio 0.9867. Objective: minimize this ratio further while maintaining constraints and closed topology.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given load at node_3 is (-15, -30), supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 and node_3 (rollers). Current nodes mostly aligned on x-axis at bottom with upper nodes at y~3.2. Members form a closed polygon with diagonal bracing. Constraints: max stress-to-weight ratio <=1.0, total mass <=30. Area choices from discrete set, current areas mostly 1 or smaller.",\n  "analysis": "Current max stress is ~7.32, total mass ~7.42, stress-to-weight ratio ~0.987. Member_1 carries large compressive stress (-7.3162) with largest area (3). Other members have low stresses and smaller areas. Generation history shows rank_1 structure with node_4 and node_5 moved closer horizontally (2.0,3.0) and (4.0,3.0) and increased area on member_3 to 2, reducing ratio to 0.6562 but increasing total mass to 11.1. This indicates horizontal repositioning of upper nodes and selective area increase improves stress distribution but at cost of mass. Current design is lighter but less efficient in load distribution, especially member_1 is highly stressed. Load path: node_3 load transmitted mainly via member_1 to node_1 and via members 4 and 5 to upper nodes and then to node_2. Possible failure mode: buckling/compression in member_1. Efficiency can be improved by better triangulation and reducing large compressive forces.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Insight: Increasing upper chord length and moving nodes horizontally improves load sharing and reduces peak stress. Increasing cross-sectional area on critical members reduces stress but increases mass. Member_7 in rank_1 has zero area, implying it can be removed without loss. Current design uses member_7 with small area. Idea: reposition nodes_4 and 5 closer to (2,3) and (4,3), increase area of compressive members, reduce area or remove low stress members to optimize mass. Keep node_3 fixed due to load and support. Node_1 and 2 fixed by supports.",\n  "proposal": "Adopt node positions similar to rank_1: node_4 at (2.0,3.0), node_5 at (4.0,3.0). Increase area of member_1 (node_1-node_3) to \'3\' (1.759), member_3 (node_1-node_4) to \'2\' (0.782) for better compression support, keep member_7 (node_4-node_5) area \'0\' (1) or remove if possible. Keep other members at area \'1\' (0.195). This should reduce max stress and keep mass within limits.",\n  "reasoning": "Symmetry and triangulation reduce bending and concentrate forces in axial members. Moving upper nodes horizontally widens top chord, reducing bending moments. Increasing area on highly stressed compressive members reduces stress. Removing low stress members reduces mass. Node_3 fixed due to load and support, node_1 and 2 fixed by supports. This design balances mass and stress, aiming for stress-to-weight ratio ~0.65 as in rank_1 but with lower mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: member_1 (node_1-node_3): length ~2.0; member_3 (node_1-node_4): length ~3.0; member_7 (node_4-node_5): length ~2.0; others similarly. Mass = sum(length * area). Stress estimated by force equilibrium and member area. Max stress-to-weight ratio = max(abs(stress))/total_mass. Adjust areas to keep ratio <=1 and mass <=30. Remove member_7 or set area to 0 if stress negligible. Use areas from given set. Node positions fixed for supports and load node. Others adjusted as above.",\n  "calculation": "Member lengths: member_1: 2.0, member_2: 4.0, member_3: 3.0, member_4: sqrt((2.0-2.0)^2+(3.0-0)^2)=3.0, member_5: sqrt((4.0-2.0)^2+(3.0-0)^2)=3.61, member_6: sqrt((6.0-4.0)^2+(0-3.0)^2)=3.61, member_7: 2.0.
