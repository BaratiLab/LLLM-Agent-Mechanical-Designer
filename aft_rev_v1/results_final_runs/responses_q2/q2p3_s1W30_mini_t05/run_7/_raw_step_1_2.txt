The goal is to redesign a fully connected 2D truss with fixed supports and loads, minimizing stress-to-weight ratio and total mass below 30.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), (2,3) with a load (-15,-30) at node_3 and supports pinned at node_1 and rollers at node_2 and node_3. Current members have varying areas with member_1 largest (area_id \'4\'=3.128) and others smaller. Max stress is 14.9, member_2 highly stressed in compression. Mass exceeds limit mainly due to long member_1 and large areas.",\n\n  "analysis": "The current truss has a horizontal base with node_3 between node_1 and node_2. The vertical node_4 at (2,3) forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 2. The load at node_3 creates high compression in member_2 (node_1-node_3). The largest mass contributor is member_1 (node_1-node_2, length 6m, area 3.128), which is lightly stressed (-0.4052) and can be reduced. The vertical member_4 (node_1-node_4) and diagonal members to node_4 carry little stress, suggesting inefficient load paths. The structure is not optimally triangulated around node_3 to distribute loads. The mass limit is exceeded due to large areas and long members. The stress-to-weight ratio is acceptable but can be improved by reducing mass. The supports fix node_1 fully and allow horizontal movement at node_2 and node_3, requiring stable triangulation to prevent mechanisms.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "The high mass is driven by the long base member and large cross-section. The load at node_3 is not well supported by triangulation. Member_2 is highly stressed, suggesting the need for stronger or shorter members around node_3. The vertical node_4 at (2,3) is not optimally placed for load transfer. A redesign placing node_4 closer to node_3 horizontally and adding a diagonal from node_3 to node_2 will improve load paths. Reducing the base member area and length by moving node_2 closer to node_1 can reduce mass. Maintaining the pinned and roller supports fixed, node_3 and node_2 positions must not change. Node_4 can be repositioned to optimize triangulation.",\n\n  "proposal": "Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed as per constraints. Reposition node_4 closer above node_3 at (2.0, 2.5) to shorten vertical members and improve triangulation. Remove the long base member_1 (node_1-node_2) and replace with two members: node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2 with optimized areas. Add diagonal members node_3-node_4 and node_2-node_4 to form a fully triangulated truss. Use smaller area members for longer members and larger areas for shorter highly stressed members to reduce mass and meet constraints.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Triangulation is critical for stability and load distribution. By repositioning node_4 closer to node_3, vertical members shorten, reducing mass. Removing the long base member and replacing it with two shorter members reduces mass and allows better load distribution. Assigning areas based on member length and expected stress reduces mass while maintaining strength. The load at node_3 is better supported by vertical and diagonal members, reducing stress concentration in member_2. Supports remain fixed as per constraints ensuring boundary conditions are met.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Load is (-15,-30) kN at node_3. Members behave linearly elastic.
