The goal is to redesign a closed 2D truss with the given loads and supports, minimizing stress-to-weight ratio and total mass below 30, while keeping nodes with loads and supports fixed.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given a horizontal base with nodes 1, 2, 3 on y=0 and a top node 4 at y=4. Load applied at node_3 (-15, -30). Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller, node_3 roller. Current design shows high stress on member_4 (node_1-node_3), indicating insufficient triangulation and load distribution. History suggests adding member_6 (node_1-node_2) reduces ratio but mass increased. Need a fully triangulated closed truss for stability and load path efficiency.",\n\n    "analysis": "The load at node_3 is large and downward-left, causing high tension/compression on members connecting node_3, especially member_4 (node_1-node_3). Current structure lacks a bottom chord member between node_1 and node_2 in the best previous design to form a closed triangle at the base. The structure is not optimally triangulated to distribute load effectively. The pinned and roller supports fix the left and middle nodes horizontally and vertically, but node_3 roller support only restricts vertical displacement, allowing horizontal movement, which may increase stresses in members connected to node_3. The top node_4 is connected to all base nodes but with uniform large areas (3) leading to heavy mass. Member areas are not optimized for load distribution. The previous attempt to add member_6 (node_1-node_2) helped but mass increased beyond 28. We need to reduce member areas where possible and add bottom chord member to close the truss. Node positions with loads/supports cannot be changed. Triangulation with bottom chord, diagonals from node_4 to node_1 and node_2, and diagonals from node_4 to node_3 and from node_1 to node_3 and node_2 to node_3 is necessary.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding member_6 (node_1-node_2) forms a closed triangle at the base, improving stability. Reducing area of highly stressed members (like member_4) and increasing area of members carrying large load (like diagonals from node_4) can improve stress distribution. The top node_4 can be slightly repositioned vertically if allowed, but here it is fixed. Using smaller area members for bottom chord and members connected to node_3 can reduce mass. Using area_id \'1\' (0.195) or \'2\' (0.782) for less stressed members and \'3\' (1.759) for critical diagonals is a good balance.",\n\n    "proposal": "Use the historic structure with added member_6 (node_1-node_2) to close the base chord. Assign areas to members based on expected load: large areas (3) for diagonals from node_4 to node_1 and node_2, medium areas (2) for diagonals to node_3, and small areas (1) for bottom chord and member_4 (node_1-node_3) to reduce stress-to-weight ratio. Keep node positions fixed for nodes with loads/supports. This closed truss with optimized member areas should satisfy constraints.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Triangulation with bottom chord (node_1-node_2) prevents large bending moments and distributes horizontal components of load. Diagonals from node_4 to node_1 and node_2 carry vertical load efficiently. Diagonals to node_3 distribute load at that point. Smaller areas on members with lower forces reduce mass. The pinned support at node_1 and roller at node_2 fix horizontal displacement, while roller at node_3 allows horizontal displacement but is stabilized by triangulation. This design balances load paths and mass.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Member length calculated by Euclidean distance. Area values from given dictionary. Member force roughly proportional to load distribution and member length. Stress estimated as force / (area * cross-sectional area unit). Mass estimated as sum(length * area). Target max stress-to-weight ratio <= 1.0. Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_4 ~4.47, node_2-node_4 ~4.47, node_3-node_4 ~4.0, node_1-node_3 ~2.0, node_2-node_3 ~4.0, node_1-node_2 = 6.0. Assign areas to balance stresses and mass.",\n\n    "calculation": "Member lengths: m1(node_1-node_4)=4.47, m2(node_2-node_4)=4.47, m3(node_3-node_4)=4.0, m4(node_1-node_3)=2.0, m5(node_2-node_3)=4.0, m6(node_1-node_2)=6.0.

Mass = 4.47*1.759*2 + 4.0*0.782 + 2.0*0.195 + 4.0*0.195 + 6.0*0.195 = 15.72 + 3.13 + 0.39 + 0.78 + 1.17 = 21.19 < 30.
