The objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss with minimal stress-to-weight ratio <=1.0 and total mass <=30, keeping supports and loaded nodes fixed.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given load at node_3 is (-15, -30), supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 and node_3 (rollers) on a horizontal baseline. Current max stress at member_4 is very high (-47.78), causing constraint violation. Member areas vary from 0 to 3.128 in current design with total mass 28.11 close to limit.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current structure has a long horizontal base (node_1 at 0,0; node_2 at 6,0) with node_3 at 2,0 and node_4 at 2,4. Members form a trapezoidal shape with diagonal and vertical members. High compressive stress in member_4 (node_1-node_3) indicates this member is overloaded. The load at node_3 creates large bending moment on the base members. The structure is not optimally triangulated; the vertical member_3 (node_3-node_4) carries tension but length and area might be suboptimal. The mass distribution is uneven, with some members overdesigned and others underdesigned. The structure is not fully triangulated as node_3 lies between node_1 and node_2 on baseline, causing stress concentration. The load path is inefficient due to node_3 position on baseline instead of elevated or shifted to improve load transfer.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress-to-weight ratio, the structure should be fully triangulated with better load path from node_3 to supports. Moving node_3 vertically off baseline is not allowed (load/support node), but node_4 can be repositioned. Adding members to form triangles including node_3 and node_4 can help distribute forces. Using smaller cross-section members on less stressed members and larger on critical members may reduce mass. Symmetry and triangulation will improve efficiency.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Retain fixed nodes with loads and supports. Reposition node_4 slightly to improve triangulation and load transfer. Add a member between node_2 and node_4 if missing, and add member between node_3 and node_2 if needed to close triangles. Adjust member areas to reduce max stress. Use area_id \'1\' (0.195) or \'2\' (0.782) for low-stress members, and \'3\' (1.759) for critical members. Remove the zero-area member_6 (node_1-node_2) to save mass and avoid unnecessary compression. Final design is a triangular truss with nodes 1, 2, 3 on baseline and node_4 elevated at (2.0,4.0).",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation ensures all nodes are stable and forces are resolved in axial members. Node_4 at (2.0, 4.0) forms triangles with nodes 1, 2, and 3. Removing the baseline member between node_1 and node_2 reduces redundant compression. Members from node_3 to node_4 and node_2 to node_4 carry load efficiently. Member areas are assigned based on expected axial forces: higher areas for members under higher compression/tension (e.g., node_3-node_4), lower areas for others. This balances mass and stress, reducing stress-to-weight ratio below 1.0.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Loads only at node_3 (-15, -30). Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 and node_3 (rollers). Node_3 fixed at (2.0, 0.0). Node_4 fixed at (2.0, 4.0).
