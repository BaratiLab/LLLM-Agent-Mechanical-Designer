Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 and node_3 (rollers). Load applied downward-left at node_3. Members have areas from 2 to 3, total mass 21.13, max stress 15.83, ratio 0.7491. Constraints satisfied. History shows attempts with added member_6 and node_4 moved, but constraint violations occurred.",\n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 causes tension in member_1 (node_1-node_3) with high negative stress (-15.83), compression in member_5 (node_3-node_4) positive stress (2.03). Members 2,3,4 have low stresses. The structure is stable and statically determinate with triangulation. Current member areas are moderate, mass is well below limit. Attempts to add members or move node_4 led to constraint violations, likely due to increased mass or stress concentrations. The main stress driver is member_1, which has relatively small area (2) but high stress magnitude. Increasing its area slightly could reduce max stress and thus ratio. Node positions of supports and load nodes are fixed; node_4 can be slightly adjusted vertically to improve force distribution. Member areas should be chosen from given discrete set.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Current design is near optimal with low mass and stress ratio well under 1.0. Member_1 is critical; increasing its area from \'2\' (0.782) to \'3\' (1.759) or \'4\' (3.128) may reduce stress and ratio. Node_4 can be raised slightly (from 3.0 to ~3.1) to improve triangulation and reduce stress in member_1 and member_5. Member areas for low-stress members (2,3,4) can be kept small to save weight. Avoid adding new members as history shows constraint violations. Aim to keep total mass under 25 for margin.",\n  "proposal": "Increase area of member_1 from \'2\' to \'3\' to reduce stress, slightly raise node_4 vertical coordinate from 3.00 to 3.10 to improve triangulation and load path. Keep other members and areas unchanged. This should reduce max stress and thus stress-to-weight ratio while keeping mass under limit.",\n  "reasoning": "Member_1 carries highest stress; increasing cross-sectional area reduces stress proportionally. Raising node_4 improves geometry, reducing force in member_1 and member_5. Members 2,3,4 have low stress, so keeping their areas small saves weight. Member_5 area kept at \'2\' for balance. This preserves statically determinate triangulated structure, ensuring stability and load path efficiency.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Stress inversely proportional to area; length calculated from node coords; mass = sum(length × area).
