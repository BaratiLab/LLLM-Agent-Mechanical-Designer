Load applied at node_3 downward-left. Supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller. With only these nodes, truss is a line, not closed. To close and triangulate, add a node above line to form a triangle. Goal: reduce stress by triangulation and distribute load efficiently.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-15, -30) N acts down-left, causing tension/compression in members. Supports: node_1 pinned (2 reactions), node_2 roller (1 reaction vertical). Current line structure unstable laterally, no triangulation. Adding a node above line near midpoint will form two triangles, creating a stable, closed truss. Members must be chosen with areas to keep total mass ≤ 30 and stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 1.0. Stress estimated by axial force/area; weight proportional to sum(length × area).",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation critical to distribute forces and reduce max stress. Positioning new node near midpoint between node_2 and node_3 but elevated maximizes stiffness and load path. Using smaller area members in tension and larger in compression can optimize mass. Load path: node_3 load transfers through two diagonal members to supports at node_1 and node_2. Total length and area must be balanced to satisfy mass constraint.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (4.0, 3.5) approx midway between node_2 and node_3 elevated to form two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_2-node_4, node_4-node_1, node_3-node_4. This closed shape ensures stability. Assign areas: larger cross-section for members under compression (longer diagonals), smaller for tension members. This balances mass and stress. Estimate forces by static equilibrium and trigonometry.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic, axial forces only. Calculate member lengths by Euclidean distance.
