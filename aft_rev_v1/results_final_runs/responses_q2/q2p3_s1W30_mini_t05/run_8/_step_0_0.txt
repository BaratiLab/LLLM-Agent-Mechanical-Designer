  "preamble": "Optimize a 2D truss with three given nodes and specified loads/supports by adding nodes and members to form a closed, triangulated structure minimizing stress-to-weight ratio under given constraints.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes are colinear along x-axis (0,0), (2,0), (6,0). Load applied at node_3 downward-left. Supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller. With only these nodes, truss is a line, not closed. To close and triangulate, add a node above line to form a triangle. Goal: reduce stress by triangulation and distribute load efficiently.",
  
  "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-15, -30) N acts down-left, causing tension/compression in members. Supports: node_1 pinned (2 reactions), node_2 roller (1 reaction vertical). Current line structure unstable laterally, no triangulation. Adding a node above line near midpoint will form two triangles, creating a stable, closed truss. Members must be chosen with areas to keep total mass ≤ 30 and stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 1.0. Stress estimated by axial force/area; weight proportional to sum(length × area).",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation critical to distribute forces and reduce max stress. Positioning new node near midpoint between node_2 and node_3 but elevated maximizes stiffness and load path. Using smaller area members in tension and larger in compression can optimize mass. Load path: node_3 load transfers through two diagonal members to supports at node_1 and node_2. Total length and area must be balanced to satisfy mass constraint.",
  
  "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (4.0, 3.5) approx midway between node_2 and node_3 elevated to form two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_2-node_4, node_4-node_1, node_3-node_4. This closed shape ensures stability. Assign areas: larger cross-section for members under compression (longer diagonals), smaller for tension members. This balances mass and stress. Estimate forces by static equilibrium and trigonometry.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic, axial forces only. Calculate member lengths by Euclidean distance. Estimate axial forces using equilibrium equations: sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, sum moments=0. Calculate stress = force/area. Mass = sum(length × area). Use area_id mapping for areas: e.g. area_id '2' = 0.782, '4' = 3.128. Target max stress/total mass ≤1.0 and total mass ≤30. Check no duplicate members and all nodes connected.",
  
  "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_4 = (4.00, 3.50). Member lengths:\nnode_1-node_3: dist between (0,0)-(2,0)=2.00\nnode_3-node_2: (2,0)-(6,0)=4.00\nnode_2-node_4: (6,0)-(4,3.5)=√(2²+3.5²)=4.03\nnode_4-node_1: (4,3.5)-(0,0)=4.72\nnode_3-node_4: (2,0)-(4,3.5)=√(2²+3.5²)=4.03\nAssign areas:\nnode_1-node_3: area_id '1' =0.195 (short member, tension)\nnode_3-node_2: area_id '2' =0.782 (compression)\nnode_2-node_4: area_id '5' =4.887 (compression diagonal)\nnode_4-node_1: area_id '5' =4.887 (compression diagonal)\nnode_3-node_4: area_id '1' =0.195 (tension diagonal)\nCalculate mass = sum(length × area):\n2×0.195 + 4×0.782 + 4.03×4.887 + 4.72×4.887 + 4.03×0.195\n=0.39 + 3.13 + 19.71 + 23.06 + 0.79 = 47.08 > 30 (too heavy)\nReduce areas on diagonals to '3' =1.759:\nMass = 2×0.195 + 4×0.782 + 4.03×1.759 + 4.72×1.759 + 4.03×0.195\n=0.39 + 3.13 + 7.09 + 8.30 + 0.79 = 19.7 < 30 (ok)\nEstimate forces (approx): Load at node_3 (-15,-30) balanced by diagonal members node_3-node_4 and node_3-node_2.\nAssuming node_3-node_4 in tension, node_3-node_2 in compression.\nMax axial force approx 34 N (from vector sum), stress = force/area.\nMax stress = 34 / 1.759 = 19.32\nStress-to-weight ratio = 19.32 / 19.7 = 0.98 ≤ 1.0 (satisfied)\nAll nodes connected, closed truss, constraints met.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Final design adds node_4 at (4.00,3.50) forming closed triangulated truss with 5 members. Areas chosen to balance mass and stress. Total mass 19.7 < 30, stress-to-weight ratio 0.98 ≤1.0. Supports and loads unchanged. No duplicate nodes or members. Design meets all objectives and constraints.",
