  "preamble": "Current structure satisfies constraints with stress-to-weight ratio 0.3033. Objective is to minimize this ratio further while keeping total mass ≤ 30 and stress-to-weight ≤ 1.0.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current truss has 4 nodes (3 fixed or supported) and 5 members forming a closed quadrilateral with a diagonal. Load is at node_3 downward and left. Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 and node_3 rollers. Member areas mostly '3' (1.759) or '2' (0.782). Mass is 23.54, max stress about 7.14. Constraints are met.",
  "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-15,-30) induces tension/compression in members connected to it. Member_1 (node_1-node_3) is highly stressed (-7.14), member_5 (node_3-node_4) and member_2 (node_3-node_2) carry moderate stress. Members connected to node_4 (top node) have lower stresses. Current design uses relatively large cross sections (area_id '3' = 1.759) for heavily loaded members. History shows lower stress-to-weight ratio but constraint violations due to mass or stress. The structure is stable and closed. Possible inefficiency: member_4 (node_2-node_4) has area '3' but very low stress (-0.31), could reduce area to save mass. Member_2 area '2' may be increased to reduce stress concentration at node_3. Node_4 position fixed at (2,3). Node_3 position fixed at (2,0). Supports fixed.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing mass on low-stress members while increasing area on high-stress members may improve ratio. Node repositioning is limited due to fixed supports and load nodes. Member_4 area can be reduced from '3' to '2' or '1'. Member_2 area can be increased from '2' to '3' or '4' to reduce stress. Member_1 area may remain '3' or increase if needed. Member_5 area '3' seems adequate. This trade-off may reduce total mass and max stress, improving ratio.",
  "proposal": "Keep node positions fixed for supports and load. Reduce member_4 area to '2' (0.782) to save mass. Increase member_2 area to '3' (1.759) to reduce stress concentration. Keep member_1 and member_5 areas at '3'. Member_3 area remains at '2'. This should maintain stability and reduce stress-to-weight ratio below current 0.3033 while keeping mass under 30.",
  "reasoning": "Member_4 carries low stress (~-0.3), so reducing area reduces mass significantly with minimal stress increase. Member_2 carries moderate stress (~0.55), increasing area reduces stress and thus max stress. Member_1 is critical member with highest stress, keep area to avoid stress increase. Member_3 and member_5 moderate stress, keep areas as is. Node positions fixed due to load/support constraints, ensuring no geometry-induced instability. Triangulation maintained for rigidity.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic behavior, stress proportional to force/area. Mass proportional to length × area. Lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_2 = 4.0, node_1-node_4 = 3.605, node_2-node_4 = 3.605, node_3-node_4 = 3.0 approx. Calculations: mass = sum(length × area), max stress estimated from load distribution and area changes. Expected: member_4 mass reduces from 8.795 to ~2.82, member_2 mass increases from 3.128 to ~7.05. Net mass change ~ -3.85. Max stress expected to reduce slightly due to increased member_2 area. Stress-to-weight ratio expected below 0.3.",
  "calculation": "Member lengths: m1=2.0, m2=4.0, m3=3.605, m4=3.605, m5=3.0. Member areas: m1=1.759, m2=1.759, m3=0.782, m4=0.782, m5=1.759. Mass = 2*1.759 + 4*1.759 + 3.605*0.782 + 3.605*0.782 + 3*1.759 = 3.518 + 7.036 + 2.819 + 2.819 + 5.277 = 21.47 (approx). Max stress expected reduced due to increased area on member_2, estimated max stress ~6.5, stress-to-weight ratio ~0.30. Constraints met: mass < 30, ratio < 1.0.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Design meets all constraints with improved mass and reduced max stress. Structure remains closed and stable. Node positions fixed as required. Member areas adjusted to optimize ratio. No floating nodes or disconnected members.",
