The objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss that satisfies all constraints by optimizing node placement and member selection while maintaining supports and loads fixed.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_1": "The structure supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 and node_3 rollers; load applied at node_3 downward and leftward (-15N, -30N). The current design uses a rectangular shape with a diagonal and chord members. Stress is highest in member_5 (node_1-node_3) causing constraint violation. Mass is slightly over limit. Areas used range from 1 to 4. The structure is closed but not fully triangulated for optimal load transfer.",\n\n  "analysis": "The load at node_3 induces tension/compression primarily in members connected to it: member_5 (node_1-node_3) is highly stressed in compression (-42.14), indicating it carries a large portion of the load. Member_4 (node_2-node_1) is also highly stressed (-13.03). Members 1,2,6 form the upper triangle but member_3 (node_3-node_2) has low stress. The structure is rectangular with a diagonal and a chord, which is suboptimal for load distribution. The mass is dominated by longer members with larger areas. The history shows attempts with fewer members and different node heights but with worse stress ratios and mass. The current design lacks sufficient triangulation and load path efficiency to reduce peak stress and mass simultaneously.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "The main issue is the high stress concentration in member_5 (node_1-node_3) due to load direction and support placement. Increasing triangulation and redistributing forces by adding a new node to form a more efficient truss shape can reduce peak stress. Also, reducing cross-sectional area in low-stress members and increasing in critical members can optimize mass. Node_4\'s vertical position (3.5) is reasonable but repositioning node_3 horizontally closer to node_1 might reduce member length and mass. The supports and load nodes must remain fixed, so redesign must focus on node_4 and possibly adding a node for better triangulation.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add a new node (node_5) above node_3 to form two triangles sharing node_4 and node_5, creating a trapezoidal shape with diagonal members for better load distribution. Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Reposition node_4 slightly right and up to 2.0,3.7 to improve triangulation and reduce stress in member_5. Use area sizes optimized for load paths: larger areas for members in compression/tension paths, smaller for chords. This structure will be fully closed and triangulated, minimizing stress-to-weight ratio and mass under constraints.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Triangulation is key to distributing loads efficiently and reducing peak member stress. Adding node_5 above node_3 creates two triangles (node_1-node_4-node_5 and node_5-node_4-node_3) sharing the load. Slightly shifting node_4 right balances member lengths and angles, reducing stress concentration. Members connecting node_4 to node_5 and node_5 to node_3 provide additional load paths. Using area \'3\' (1.759) for critical members and area \'1\' (0.195) for chords reduces mass. The pinned and roller supports remain unchanged to maintain boundary conditions and equilibrium.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic behavior, uniform material properties. Calculate member lengths by Euclidean distance. Estimate member forces by static equilibrium and truss method (joint method). Mass = sum(length * area). Use areas from given dictionary. Max stress proportional to force / area. Target max stress-to-weight ratio ≤1.0 and mass ≤30. Node coordinates precise to 1e-2. Members: connect all nodes to form closed triangulated structure. Check force balance at loaded node_3 and supports.",\n\n  "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1(0.00,0.00), node_2(6.00,0.00), node_3(2.00,0.00), node_4(2.20,3.70), node_5(3.50,4.50). Member lengths calculated. Assign areas: members carrying main load (node_1-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_3) area \'3\' (1.759), chords (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_2-node_1) area \'1\' (0.195), diagonal (node_4-node_3) area \'2\' (0.782).
