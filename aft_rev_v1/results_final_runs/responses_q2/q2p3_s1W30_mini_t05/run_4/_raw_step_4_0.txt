Objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss satisfying max stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 1.0 and total mass ≤ 30, while keeping nodes with loads and supports fixed.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given loads, supports, nodes and members show that the highly stressed member_6 (node_1-node_3) causes constraint violation. Historic structures with fewer nodes or simpler topology have higher stress-to-weight ratios or mass exceeding 30. Need a balanced closed truss with triangulation and efficient load paths.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-15, -30) induces high stress in member_6 connecting node_1 to node_3, likely due to direct diagonal tension/compression without sufficient triangulation. Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 and node_3 (rollers) fix horizontal and vertical displacements. Current design has 5 nodes but member forces are uneven and some members underutilized. Historic designs with 4 nodes have lower mass but higher stress ratios. The structure lacks a stable triangulated frame around node_3 to distribute load effectively. Members connecting node_4 and node_5 add mass without sufficient load sharing benefit.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress-to-weight ratio, must reduce peak member stress and/or increase member areas efficiently. Adding a strategically placed node above node_3 to form a triangular bracing can reduce stress in member_6. Removing node_5 reduces unnecessary mass. Use area_id selections to balance member strength and weight. Symmetry and triangulation are key. Node_3 is fixed by load and support, so surrounding structure must absorb loads better.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Redesign the truss with 4 nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0) fixed by load/support, and a new node_4 above node_3 at (2.0, 3.0). Connect members to form a closed, triangulated quadrilateral: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_2-node_1, and diagonals node_1-node_3 and node_4-node_2. Assign member areas to keep mass under 30 and stress ratio ≤1.0.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "This 4-node design forms a stable trapezoidal truss with triangulation, reducing stress concentration at node_3. The diagonal member node_4-node_2 helps distribute load from node_3 to node_2 and node_1 supports. Keeping node_3 fixed ensures load application point is unchanged. The height of node_4 at 3.0 balances vertical support and member lengths to minimize mass. Area assignments prioritize higher areas on diagonals and lower on base members to optimize weight and strength.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic behavior, uniform material properties. Member length calculated by Euclidean distance. Member mass = length × area (area from area_id mapping). Max stress estimated from load distribution and member forces calculated by static equilibrium. Stress-to-weight ratio = max(abs(stress))/total mass.
