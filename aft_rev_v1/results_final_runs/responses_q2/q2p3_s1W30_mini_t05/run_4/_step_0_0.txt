  "preamble": "Optimize a 2D truss with three original nodes under given loads and supports, aiming to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio while ensuring a closed structure and satisfying mass and stress constraints.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes at (0,0), (6,0), and (2,0), with node_3 loaded (-15 N at -30°) and supports pinned at node_1 and roller at nodes_2 and 3. Constraints require a closed truss connecting all nodes, max stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 1.0, and total mass ≤ 30. Initial structure is a line, not closed or stable for lateral load.",

  "analysis": "The current three nodes lie on the x-axis, which cannot form a stable 2D truss under lateral load at node_3. To resist the downward-left force at node_3, triangulation is needed. A triangle or polygon with vertical and diagonal members can distribute forces effectively. Supports: node_1 pinned (restrains x,y), node_2 roller (y restrained), node_3 roller (y restrained). The load at node_3 has horizontal and vertical components, requiring horizontal reaction at node_1 and vertical reactions at nodes 2 and 3. Without vertical height, no triangulation; structure is unstable. Adding one or two nodes above the x-axis to form triangles will improve stability and reduce stress.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a single node above node_3 near x=2, y=3 creates two triangles: (node_1, node_3, new_node) and (node_3, node_2, new_node). This forms a closed polygon with four nodes and multiple members, distributing load paths effectively. Members can be sized with moderate areas to keep mass low. Using smaller areas on shorter members and larger areas on longer/high-stress members can optimize weight and stress ratio.",

  "reasoning": "Introduce one new node (node_4) at (2.0, 3.0) to form a stable triangular structure. Connect members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_2-node_1, and node_1-node_3. This closed polygon ensures triangulation and load transfer. Assign area_id based on member length and expected force: longer members get higher area_id for strength; shorter members get lower area_id to save weight. Use area_id '2' (0.782) for moderate length members, '1' (0.195) for short members, and '3' (1.759) for longest or critical members. Avoid over-sizing to keep mass ≤ 30.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: uniform material density, axial forces only, linear elastic behavior. Calculate member lengths using distance formula. Estimate forces using static equilibrium: sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, sum moments=0. Approximate member forces by resolving load at node_3 through triangulated members. Calculate member mass = length × area (using given area_id values). Total mass = sum of all member masses. Calculate stress proportional to force/area (simplified). Ensure max(abs(stress))/total_mass ≤ 1.0 and total_mass ≤ 30.",

  "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1 (0.0,0.0), node_2 (6.0,0.0), node_3 (2.0,0.0), node_4 (2.0,3.0). Member lengths: n1-n4=3.0, n4-n3=3.0, n3-n2=4.0, n2-n1=6.0, n1-n3=2.0. Assign areas: n1-n4: area_id '2' (0.782), n4-n3: '2' (0.782), n3-n2: '3' (1.759), n2-n1: '1' (0.195), n1-n3: '1' (0.195). Calculate mass: (3*0.782)+(3*0.782)+(4*1.759)+(6*0.195)+(2*0.195)=2.346+2.346+7.036+1.17+0.39=13.288 < 30. Estimate forces: load at node_3 is 15 N at -30°, Fx=-15*cos(30°)=-12.99 N, Fy=-15*sin(30°)=-7.5 N. Horizontal reaction at node_1 balances Fx. Vertical reactions at node_2 and node_3 balance Fy. Members n4-n3 and n1-n4 carry diagonal tension/compression. Maximum member force estimated ~15 N. Stress-to-weight ratio ~ max force / total mass = 15/13.288 =1.13 >1.0. Slightly increase area of critical member n3-n2 to '4' (3.128) to reduce stress. New mass=13.288-7.036+(4*3.128)=13.288-7.036+12.512=18.764. New ratio=15/18.764=0.8 ≤1.0 constraints met.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Final design uses four nodes forming two triangles with five members. Member areas adjusted to satisfy mass ≤ 30 and stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 1.0. Structure is fully connected and stable under given loads/supports. No duplicate nodes or members. Coordinates and areas precise. Ready for output.",
