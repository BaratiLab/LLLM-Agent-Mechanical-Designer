The goal is to redesign a closed 2D truss with the given supports and loads, minimizing stress-to-weight ratio and ensuring total mass ≤ 30.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Current loads: node_3 with (-15, -30) force; supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 (roller). Nodes node_1, node_2, and node_3 fixed; node_4 is free. Members connect nodes forming a partial triangle but with high stress in member_5 (node_1-node_3).",\n    "analysis": "The load at node_3 creates tension/compression in members connected to it. Member_5 (node_1-node_3) shows max stress (-50.4664), indicating it is overstressed. The structure lacks sufficient triangulation and load path redundancy. Member_3 (node_3-node_2) is also heavily loaded. The current design is not fully closed or optimally triangulated. Node_4 is vertically above node_3 but not well integrated to distribute load. The mass distribution is skewed with member_3 very heavy (12.512).",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "The main issue is high stress concentration in members directly connected to loaded node_3 and insufficient triangulation to transfer load efficiently to supports. Adding more members to form closed triangles and redistributing node_4 position can improve load paths and reduce stress. Using larger area members on critical load paths and smaller area members on less stressed members can optimize mass.",\n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss with an additional node (node_5) to form a more symmetric, closed triangular structure around node_3 and node_4. Keep supports and loaded nodes fixed. Add members to ensure full triangulation. Adjust node_4 and new node_5 coordinates to improve load distribution. Use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for most members, \'1\' (0.195) for less stressed members, and \'3\' (1.759) for critical members to balance stress and mass.",\n    "reasoning": "Triangulation is key for stability and load transfer. Adding node_5 at an offset from node_4 will create two triangles sharing node_3 and node_4, distributing forces better. Keeping node_3 fixed with roller support allows horizontal load transfer. Using pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 provides statically determinate support. This structure reduces bending and concentrates forces in axial members, lowering max stress. Selecting appropriate member areas balances stress and mass.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic behavior, axial forces only, uniform material density. Calculate member lengths from node coordinates. Member mass = length × area. Max stress estimated from load / cross-sectional area proportional to area_id. Force equilibrium at nodes ensures load distribution. Aim for max stress ≤ area strength threshold scaled by area_id to keep stress-to-weight ≤ 1.0. Use Pythagoras for lengths. Check total mass ≤ 30.",\n    "calculation": "Node coordinates chosen to form right triangles with legs ~3m and 4m lengths for manageable member lengths. Member lengths: ~3.0, 4.0, 5.0 m for sides of triangles. Assign \'3\' area_id to longest members to reduce stress, \'2\' to medium, \'1\' to shortest. Total mass estimated as sum(length × area). Estimated max stress reduced below previous 50 by increased area and better load paths. Stress-to-weight ratio estimated <1.0. Total mass ~20, under 30 limit.",\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Final design has 5 nodes, fully triangulated with 7 members. Supports and load nodes fixed.
