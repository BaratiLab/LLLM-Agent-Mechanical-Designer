Load of -15N at 30° down-left on node_3. Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 and node_3 (rollers). Constraints limit stress-to-weight ratio to 0.5 and total mass ≤ 30. Original nodes alone form a line; no closed truss possible without adding nodes.",\n    \n    "analysis": "A stable truss requires triangulation. Current nodes are colinear along x-axis, so adding at least one node above to form a triangle is necessary. Load at node_3 acts downward-left, inducing tension/compression in members. Supports provide vertical and horizontal restraints. Failure modes likely buckling in compression members or excessive tension. Efficient load path requires direct triangulation from loaded node to supports. Mass depends on member lengths and cross-sectional areas; larger areas reduce stress but increase mass. Balancing this is key.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "To form a closed truss, add one node above nodes 1 and 2 to create a triangle. Position node_4 at (3.0, 4.0) to create two triangles: (node_1, node_2, node_4) and (node_1, node_3, node_4). This provides multiple load paths. Use smaller areas on longer members and larger areas on critical members under tension. Avoid redundant members to minimize mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (3.0, 4.0) to form a stable triangular frame. Connect node_4 to nodes 1, 2, and 3 to create a closed truss with multiple triangular elements. Use area_id \'3\' (1.759) for members under high tension/compression and smaller area_id \'1\' (0.195) for less stressed members. This balances mass and stress. Members: (1-3), (1-4), (2-4), (3-4), (1-2), (2-3). This creates multiple load paths and distributes forces well.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Uniform material density, linear elastic behavior, axial forces only. Calculate member lengths using distance formula. Estimate forces by static equilibrium (sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, sum moments=0). Calculate stress = force / area. Mass = sum(length * area).

Calculate total mass approx: (6*0.195)+(2*1.759)+(4*0.195)+(5*1.759)+(5*0.195)+(4.123*1.759) = 1.17+3.52+0.78+8.80+0.98+7.25=22.5 < 30. Estimated max stress from load distribution ~7.5 N/unit area.
