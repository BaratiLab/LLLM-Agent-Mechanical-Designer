The goal is to create a triangulated structure with added nodes to improve load distribution and satisfy constraints on stress-to-weight ratio and total mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes at (0,0), (6,0), and (2,0) lie collinearly on x-axis. Load at node_3 is (-15 N, -30 N) downward-left. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2, node_3 (rollers). Triangulation needed for stability and load path. Constraints: stress-to-weight ratio <= 0.5 and total mass <= 30 units. Areas available from 0 to 10 with given cross-sectional areas. Initial design must add nodes to form triangles and reduce bending moments.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The three nodes are collinear, which is structurally unstable for lateral loads. The load at node_3 has components left and downward, inducing bending and tension/compression in members. Supports: node_1 pinned (restrains both directions), node_2 and node_3 rollers (restrain vertical only). The structure must be closed and connected; thus, adding nodes above the line to form triangles will stabilize against lateral loads and reduce stress concentration. Without triangulation, stress will be high in direct members. Efficiency requires short members, preferably forming equilateral or isosceles triangles. Member selection must balance weight and stress. The load path should transfer forces from node_3 through triangulated members to supports at node_1 and node_2.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Collinearity is a major concern; adding nodes above the x-axis will create triangles and improve stiffness. The load at node_3 is significant, so members connected to this node must have sufficient area. The total mass constraint limits the sum of length*area. Using a few larger area members near load and supports, and smaller areas elsewhere, can optimize stress-to-weight ratio. The stress-to-weight ratio constraint (<=0.5) is strict, so member forces and areas must be carefully balanced. The structure must be fully connected (closed), so adding at least one node above the line and connecting all nodes in triangles is essential.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Add one node (node_4) at (3.0, 3.0) above the line between node_1 and node_2 to form two triangles: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_3-node_2-node_4. This creates a stable triangulated truss. Connect node_4 to all three base nodes. Assign larger area members to high force members connecting node_3 to node_4 and node_1 to node_4 to carry load efficiently. Use smaller area members for base chords to reduce mass. This triangulation distributes load from node_3 to supports effectively, reducing maximum stress and total mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic axial members, uniform material density, stress proportional to axial force / area.
