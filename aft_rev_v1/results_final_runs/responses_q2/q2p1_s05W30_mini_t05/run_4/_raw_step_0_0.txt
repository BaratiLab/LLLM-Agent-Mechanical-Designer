Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) fix horizontal and vertical displacements. Node_3 roller support allows vertical displacement. The goal is a closed truss, so additional nodes and members are needed to form triangles for stability and load transfer.",\n\n    "analysis": "The load at node_3 is (-15N, -30N) pointing down-left. Node_1 pinned support fixes both directions, node_2 roller fixes vertical only, node_3 roller fixes vertical only. Current nodes are colinear on x-axis, which is unstable under the diagonal load. Without triangulation, the truss will have large bending stresses and no closed loop. To minimize stress-to-weight ratio, the truss must be triangulated, adding nodes above or below the line to form triangles. Load path will transfer diagonal load from node_3 through new members to node_1 and node_2 supports. Failure modes include buckling in compression members and tension overstress. Using smaller cross-sectional areas where forces are small and larger areas where forces are large can optimize weight.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation is critical: adding a new node above node_3 or between node_1 and node_2 will create a closed polygon. The load direction suggests adding a node above node_3 to form two triangles: (node_1, node_3, new_node) and (node_3, node_2, new_node). This will distribute forces and stabilize the structure. Area selection will be critical to keep mass under 30 and stress-to-weight ratio under 0.5.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Add a new node_4 at (4.0, 3.0) above the line between node_2 and node_3 to form two triangles: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_3-node_2-node_4. This creates a closed truss with 4 nodes and 5 members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_2-node_4. This triangulation efficiently transfers loads. Use smaller area (id \'1\' = 0.195) for shorter members under low tension/compression and larger areas (id \'4\' = 3.128) for longer/high force members. This balances weight and stress.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic members, axial forces only, uniform material. Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance.
