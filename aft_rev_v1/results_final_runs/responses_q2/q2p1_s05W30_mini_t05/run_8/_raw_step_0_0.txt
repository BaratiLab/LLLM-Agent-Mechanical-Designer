Objective is to minimize max(abs(stress))/total_weight ≤ 0.5 while total mass ≤ 30, ensuring full connectivity and structural stability.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given 3 nodes along x-axis (0,0), (6,0), (2,0) with load at node_3 downward-left and supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 (roller). Initial structure is a line, not closed or triangulated. Need to add nodes and members to form a closed truss and distribute load efficiently.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 is (-15, -30)N, acting diagonally down-left. Supports: node_1 pinned (restrains x,y), node_2 roller (restrains y), node_3 roller (restrains y). Current nodes colinear, no triangulation, unstable under lateral load. Without triangulation, structure will deform. Closed truss requires at least one additional node above to form triangles. Load path must transfer load efficiently to supports. Failure modes: buckling in compression members, excessive tensile stress. Efficiency requires direct load paths with minimal member length and appropriate cross-section areas balancing weight and strength.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a node above node_3 to form two triangles: (node_1, node_3, new_node) and (node_3, node_2, new_node) creates stable triangulated structure. This allows load at node_3 to transfer through the new node to supports. Choose cross-sections to minimize weight but resist stresses. Use smaller areas in tension, larger in compression if needed. Avoid overly large areas to keep mass ≤ 30. Symmetry not possible due to node positions but triangulation is critical.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 3.5) above node_3 to form two triangles: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_3-node_2-node_4. This creates a closed truss with 4 nodes and 5 members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4. Load at node_3 transfers directly to node_4 and supports. Assign areas: small area (0.195) for diagonal members under tension, moderate area (3.128) for compression members. Use shortest members for higher area to reduce weight. Calculate forces assuming pin-jointed truss, static equilibrium. Verify stress-to-weight ratio and mass constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic, pin-jointed truss, uniform member properties per area_id.
