Current design meets constraints but has a stress-to-weight ratio of 0.4657. Objective is to minimize this ratio further while respecting constraints on max stress-to-weight ratio (<=0.5) and total mass (<=30).",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Current structure: nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), (3,1.55). Members form a closed quadrilateral with a diagonal member_5 connecting node_3 and node_4. Load at node_3 is (-15, -30). Supports fix node_1 pinned, node_2 and node_3 rollers. Current max stress 10.77, total mass 23.13, ratio 0.4657. History shows best design with node_4 slightly raised to 1.65 and area adjustments reduced ratio to 0.2579 but increased mass slightly to 23.42.",\n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 is large downward-left force, causing tension/compression in members connected to node_3. Node_1 pinned and node_2, node_3 rollers provide boundary conditions allowing horizontal and vertical reactions. Current structure uses moderate cross-sectional areas (area_id 2 and 3) for members connected to loaded node_3, which balances stress and mass. Member_1 (node_1-node_3) carries highest compressive stress. Member_6 (node_1-node_2) is zero area, likely a non-load carrying member. History shows increasing node_4 y-coordinate to 1.65 improves load path, reducing max stress and ratio. Using area_id 3 for member_1 and member_2 improves strength but increases mass. Constraint not met cases show that excessive node_4 height or low area members cause high stress or disconnected structures. The best historic design is close to optimal with ratio 0.2579, mass 23.42, max stress 6.04, all constraints met.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Raising node_4 slightly above 1.55 to 1.65 improves triangulation and load transfer, reducing max stress. Increasing cross-sectional area of critical members (member_1, member_2) reduces stress but increases mass. Member_5 area reduced from 3 to 2 reduces mass without increasing stress significantly. Member_6 remains zero area for weight saving as it carries minimal load. The structure is stable and closed with 4 nodes and 6 members forming two triangles. The best historic design balances these factors well.",\n  "proposal": "Adopt the best historic design with node_4 at (3.00, 1.65), increase member_1 and member_2 areas to \'3\', reduce member_5 area to \'2\', keep member_3 and member_4 at \'2\', member_6 at \'0\'. This design lowers max stress-to-weight ratio to 0.2579, well within constraints, and total mass 23.42 < 30. No further node movement needed as load and supports are fixed and structure is symmetric and stable.",\n  "reasoning": "Load path improved by raising node_4 to 1.65, increasing vertical height of the truss. This enhances triangulation and reduces bending moments. Increasing area of members connected to loaded node_3 (member_1, member_2) reduces stress concentration. Reducing member_5 area balances mass reduction without compromising strength. Keeping member_6 zero area saves weight as it carries little load. Structure remains closed and stable with 6 members forming two triangles. Supports and load node positions fixed to preserve boundary conditions and loading.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assume linear elastic behavior. Calculate member lengths from node coordinates. Member mass = length * area (area from given area_id mapping). Total mass = sum of member masses. Max stress estimated from FEM results in history for similar configurations. Stress-to-weight ratio = max(abs(stress))/total mass. Ensure ratio <= 0.5 and total mass <= 30. Member areas selected from given discrete area_id values.
