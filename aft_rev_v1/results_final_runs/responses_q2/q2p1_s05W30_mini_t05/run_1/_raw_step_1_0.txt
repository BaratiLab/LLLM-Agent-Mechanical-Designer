The objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss that satisfies stress-to-weight ratio <=0.5 and total mass <=30 while maintaining given loads and supports.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Current design has heavy members (high area factors) causing excessive mass. The load is concentrated at node_3 with a force (-15, -30). Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 and node_3 (rollers) restrict horizontal and vertical displacements appropriately. Existing members have areas mostly large (e.g., 9, 10) contributing to mass. The current structure is a quadrilateral with diagonal bracing but too heavy.",\n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 is downward-left, causing tension/compression in members connecting node_3 to others. The member_1 (node_1-node_3) has highest compressive stress (-0.795), indicating it is critical. The mass is dominated by members with large areas (member_6 area 10, member_1 area 9). The structure is not optimized for weight. The current design is a simple 4-node truss with a single top node (node_4) providing triangulation but member areas are oversized. The mass constraint is violated heavily (120.7 vs allowed 30). Stress-to-weight ratio is low (0.0065), meaning stress is low relative to mass, so we can reduce member areas significantly. The structure is closed but inefficient.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "The key to reducing mass is to reduce member areas drastically while maintaining structural integrity. The load path is mainly from node_3 to supports at node_1 and node_2, so members connected to node_3 should be sized carefully. Adding a second top node to form a triangular truss shape can improve load distribution and allow smaller member areas. Maintaining node_3 position (with load) and nodes_1 and 2 (supports) fixed is mandatory. Adjusting node_4 position and adding one more node for better triangulation is beneficial.",\n  "proposal": "Redesign the truss by keeping node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Add a new node_4 above node_3 to form two triangles: node_1-node_4-node_3 and node_3-node_4-node_2. Connect members to form a closed truss with 5 nodes and 7 members. Use smaller cross-sectional areas (area_id \'1\' or \'2\') to reduce mass. Position node_4 at (3.0, 3.0) to improve triangulation and load transfer. This design balances load paths, reduces mass, and satisfies stress-to-weight ratio constraint.",\n  "reasoning": "Triangulation improves stiffness and reduces bending moments. Positioning node_4 above node_3 allows load at node_3 to be transferred efficiently to supports. Using smaller areas reduces mass drastically. Members connecting supports to node_4 and node_3 carry tension/compression efficiently. The closed truss with 5 nodes and 7 members ensures no isolated nodes and structural stability. Supports and load nodes remain fixed to respect boundary conditions.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Member length calculated by Euclidean distance. Member mass = length Ã— area_factor. Area factors from given dictionary. Stress assumed proportional to load and member length; smaller areas reduce mass but must be sufficient for stress. Estimate total mass by summing member masses with reduced areas. Stress-to-weight ratio estimated by max member stress / total mass, target <=0.5. Member selection: use \'1\' (0.195) or \'2\' (0.782) areas for light members. Node_4 at (3.0, 3.0) creates two triangles.
