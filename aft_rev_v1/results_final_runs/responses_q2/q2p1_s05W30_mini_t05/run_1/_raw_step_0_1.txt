Objective is to minimize max(abs(stress))/total_weight ≤ 0.5 and total mass ≤ 30 with given discrete area options.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes form a line on x-axis: node_1 (0,0), node_3 (2,0), node_2 (6,0). Load at node_3 is (-15, -30) N (left and downward). Supports: node_1 pinned (both x,y fixed), node_2 roller (vertical fixed, horizontal free), node_3 roller (vertical fixed, horizontal free). Initial structure is colinear and open; needs closure and triangulation for stability and load transfer. Members must form a closed loop, so adding a node above the line to form a triangle is natural.",\n\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 is downward-left, so node_3 must be supported by members transferring load to node_1 and node_2. Direct member between node_1 and node_2 spans 6 m. Node_3 is between them at 2 m from node_1. To form a closed truss, add a new node above line (e.g. node_4) to form a triangle with nodes 1 and 2. This creates members: (1-4), (2-4), and (3-4) plus base members (1-3), (3-2), and (1-2). Triangulation ensures structural stability and efficient load paths. The area selection must balance weight and stress capacity. Larger areas reduce stress but increase weight. Load direction suggests tension in members from node_3 to node_4 and compression in base.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation with a single apex node above base line is effective. Node_4 placed near midpoint x=3.0, y=2.0 provides good geometry. Members (1-4), (2-4), and (3-4) create direct load paths from loaded node_3 to supports. Base members (1-3), (3-2), (1-2) provide stability and distribute forces. Area selection: largest areas on highly stressed members (1-3), (3-4), (2-4), smaller areas on less stressed (1-4), (3-2), (1-2).",\n\n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (3.0, 2.0) to form triangle with nodes 1 and 2. Members: base (1-3), (3-2), (1-2); top triangle (1-4), (2-4), (3-4). This closed loop ensures all nodes connected and stable. Assign area ids based on expected stress: highest on (3-4), (1-3), (2-4); moderate on others. This balances mass and stress capacity to meet constraints.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic behavior, truss members only carry axial forces.
