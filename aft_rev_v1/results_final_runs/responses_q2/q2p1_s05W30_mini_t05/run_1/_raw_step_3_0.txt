The objective is to redesign the truss to minimize stress-to-weight ratio below 0.5 and total mass below 30 while maintaining supports and load positions fixed.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given load at node_3 (-15N x, -30N y), supports pinned at node_1 and rollers at nodes 2 and 3, current max stress-to-weight ratio is 5.864 (far above 0.5) and mass 8.368 (below 30). Current structure has 4 nodes and 6 members, some members highly stressed (member_1 at -49 MPa).",\n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 induces large tension/compression in member_1 (node_1-node_3). The current structure is a trapezoidal shape with a top node_4 at (2.0,1.2). Members connecting node_4 have low stress, indicating poor load path efficiency. The structure is not optimally triangulated; member_6 (node_1-node_2) carries load but is not enough to reduce stress in member_1. The generation history shows attempts to increase node height and add members, but mass exploded or stress remained high. The key failure is the high stress in member_1 due to insufficient triangulation and load distribution. The structure is not fully triangulated and does not form a stable closed polygon with minimal slender members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "A fully triangulated structure with nodes forming a triangle or quadrilateral with diagonals will distribute forces better and reduce peak stresses. Increasing the height of node_4 and repositioning node_3 to form a triangle with node_1 and node_2 can improve load paths. Using moderate cross-sectional areas for critical members will reduce stress-to-weight ratio. Avoid large mass members while ensuring sufficient stiffness.",\n  "proposal": "Redesign the truss as a triangular frame with nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2.0,0) fixed, and node_4 elevated at (3.0, 2.4) to form two triangles: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_2-node_3-node_4. Members connect all nodes forming a closed triangulated frame. Use moderate cross-sectional areas to balance mass and stress. Keep existing supports and loads fixed.",\n  "reasoning": "Triangulation ensures structural stability and distributes forces efficiently. Elevating node_4 to 2.4m doubles previous height, increasing vertical stiffness and reducing bending in bottom chord. Members connecting node_4 to nodes 1, 2, and 3 create load paths that reduce stress in member_1. Using area \'2\' (0.782) for critical members and \'1\' (0.195) for less stressed members optimizes mass. The closed triangle frame prevents mechanisms and reduces peak stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance.
