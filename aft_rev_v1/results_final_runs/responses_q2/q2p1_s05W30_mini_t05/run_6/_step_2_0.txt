  "preamble": "Optimize a 2D truss with 4 nodes and 6 members under given loads and supports to minimize stress-to-weight ratio while satisfying constraints on max stress-to-weight (<=0.5) and total mass (<=30). Current design satisfies constraints with ratio 0.3134 but has room for improvement.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current structure has nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), (2,2.5) with members forming a closed quadrilateral with a diagonal. Load is at node_3 downward and left. Supports fix node_1 pinned, node_2 and node_3 rollers. Current max stress 7.06, total mass 22.53, stress-to-weight ratio 0.3134. History shows attempts with taller node_4 (3.5) increased mass and lowered stress ratio but violated mass constraint.",
  "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-15,-30) induces tension/compression in members connected to node_3. Members member_1 (node_1-node_3) and member_6 (node_3-node_4) carry significant stress. Member_5 (node_4-node_2) has low stress but high mass. Current design uses area_id 3 mostly, with member_2 and member_6 smaller areas. The structure is stable and closed. The largest stress is in member_1 (-7.06). The mass is acceptable but can be reduced by optimizing member areas and node_4 position. Increasing node_4 height improves stiffness but increases mass. Member_3 (node_1-node_2) is missing in current design but appeared in history with constraint violation. Triangulation is good with diagonal member_6. Current design is efficient but member_5 is heavy with low stress, suggesting area reduction or node_4 repositioning.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_5 area_id 3 (mass 8.2972) is heavy but stress is low (-0.3825). Reducing area there or shortening member_5 by adjusting node_4 closer to node_2 horizontally may reduce mass. Member_1 has highest stress, area 3. Increasing area there could reduce stress but increase mass. Node_3 is fixed due to load and roller support. Node_4 can move vertically or horizontally within limits. Adding member_3 (node_1-node_2) may help redistribute load but risks increasing mass. Current design is close to optimal but can be improved by reducing member_5 area and slightly adjusting node_4 horizontally to shorten member_5 and member_4.",
  "proposal": "Retain current node positions for supports and load nodes. Move node_4 slightly closer to node_2 horizontally (from x=2.0 to ~2.8) to shorten member_5 and member_4. Reduce area_id of member_5 from '3' to '2' to reduce mass while keeping adequate strength. Increase area_id of member_1 from '3' to '4' to reduce max stress. Maintain other member areas as is. This should reduce stress-to-weight ratio below current 0.3134 while satisfying constraints.",
  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 closer to node_2 shortens long members, reducing mass and stress. Increasing member_1 area reduces max stress member. Reducing member_5 area reduces mass with minor stress increase expected due to shorter length. Triangulation is preserved with member_6 diagonal. Supports and load nodes fixed. This balances load paths and mass efficiently.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate new member lengths with node_4 at (2.8,2.5). Lengths: member_5 (node_4-node_2) ~ sqrt((6-2.8)^2 + 0^2)=3.2, down from 4.0; member_4 (node_1-node_4) ~ sqrt((2.8-0)^2 + 2.5^2)=~3.77, down from 4.03. Member_1 length unchanged (2.0). Mass = sum(length * area). Member_1 area 4: 3.128, member_5 area 2: 0.782. Estimate stresses assuming proportional to load and inversely to area. Check max stress-to-weight ratio <=0.5 and total mass <=30.",
  "calculation": "Member lengths: member_1=2.0, member_5=3.2, member_4=3.77, others unchanged approx. Mass: member_1=2.0*3.128=6.256, member_5=3.2*0.782=2.502, member_4=3.77*1.759=6.63, others approx same: member_2=3.128*2=6.256, member_6=length ~2.9*0.782=2.27. Total mass ~6.256+2.502+6.63+6.256+2.27+ member_3 is absent, total ~23.9 <30. Max stress expected reduced on member_1 due to area increase (stress reduces by ratio 3/4=0.75), new max stress ~7.06*0.75=5.3. Stress-to-weight ratio=5.3/23.9=0.222 <0.3134 and <0.5 constraint. Constraints satisfied.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Design moves node_4 horizontally to 2.8, keeps y=2.5. Changes member_1 area to '4', member_5 area to '2', others unchanged. Total mass and max stress-to-weight ratio improved. Structure remains closed with triangulation. Supports and load nodes fixed. No constraint violated. Design is better than current best.",
