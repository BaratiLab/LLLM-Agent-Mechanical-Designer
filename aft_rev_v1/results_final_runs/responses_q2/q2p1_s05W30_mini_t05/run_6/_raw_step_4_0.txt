Current design at iteration 3/25 satisfies constraints with ratio 0.3957. The objective is to improve or redesign to reduce this ratio further while keeping a closed truss and respecting node constraints.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Current structure has 4 nodes with supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 and node_3 (rollers). Load is applied at node_3 downward and left. Members connect nodes forming a closed quadrilateral with diagonal. Current max stress is ~7.04 with mass ~17.79, ratio 0.3957. History shows better ratio 0.1876 but with higher mass 21.21 and larger cross-sections. Constraints: max ratio <= 0.5 and total mass <= 30. Area sizes range from 0.195 to 19.548. Current design uses mostly area_id 2 and 3. Node_4 position varies in history between (2.0,2.5) and (2.8,2.5).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-15,-30) creates tension/compression in members connected to it. Node_1 pinned and node_2, node_3 rollers constrain vertical and horizontal displacements. Current design shows member_1 highly stressed in compression (-7.036), member_6 in tension (0.5955). Member_1 area is 3 (1.759), relatively small for high stress. History rank_1 with node_4 at (2.8,2.5) and larger member_1 area (4) reduces max stress and ratio significantly (0.1876) but increases mass to 21.21. Rank_2 with node_4 at (2.0,2.5) has higher ratio 0.3134 and mass 22.5. Constraint_not_met_1 adds member_3 (node_1-node_2) but mass 50.6 exceeds limit. Current design is lighter but stress concentrated in member_1. Triangulation with diagonal member_6 is effective for load path. Node_4 placement affects force distribution. Larger cross sections reduce stress but increase mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: better ratio correlates with larger cross-section on critical members and node_4 shifted towards node_2 (2.8,2.5) rather than (2.4,2.7). Member_1 area increase from 3 to 4 lowers stress. Member_6 area smaller in rank_1 (2) vs current (3) reduces mass. Insight: Increasing node_4 x-coordinate closer to node_2 improves force distribution. Member_1 area increase critical. Member_5 area can be minimal (2). Balancing cross-section sizes to reduce peak stress while controlling mass is key. Node_3 and node_2 positions fixed due to supports and loads. Node_4 repositioning within feasible range can optimize truss geometry.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Propose to adopt node_4 at (2.8, 2.5) as in rank_1 for better load distribution. Increase member_1 area from 3 to 4 to reduce peak stress. Reduce member_6 area from 3 to 2 to save mass. Keep member_2 and member_5 areas minimal (2) as in rank_1. Member_4 area can be 3 to balance load transfer. This design balances stress reduction and mass increase, keeping total mass under 30 and ratio well below 0.5. No new members added to keep structure simple and closed.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Node_4 moved rightwards to (2.8, 2.5) shifts load path, reducing stress concentration on member_1. Increasing member_1 cross section reduces stress proportionally. Member_6 reduced cross section to save mass as its stress is lower. Member_4 area moderate to transfer load from node_4 to node_1. Members 2 and 5 minimal area since their stress is low. This triangulated design ensures stiffness and load path efficiency. Supports and load nodes fixed, so node_4 repositioning is the only geometric optimization possible. This approach follows principles of triangulation, load path optimization, and mass minimization.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Stress inversely proportional to cross-sectional area; mass proportional to member length times area weight factor.
