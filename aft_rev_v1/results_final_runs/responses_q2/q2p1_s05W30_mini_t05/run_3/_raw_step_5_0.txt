The objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss that satisfies the stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 0.5 and total mass ≤ 30, while preserving supports and load nodes.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given loads at node_3 and supports at nodes 1 (pinned), 2 (roller), and 3 (roller). Current design has 6 nodes and 10 members, with some members highly stressed (member_5 at -16.18). Constraints violated due to stress concentration near node_3 and possibly insufficient triangulation or inefficient load paths. History shows attempts with fewer nodes and members led to higher stress and mass.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 is significant (-15, -30), causing high stress in members connected to node_3, especially member_5 (node_1 to node_3). Supports at node_1 (pinned) and rollers at node_2 and node_3 provide boundary conditions. Current structure has upper nodes 4,5,6 forming a polygon, but members 7-10 with small areas carry some load but do not sufficiently reduce stress in critical members. History shows simpler trusses with fewer nodes led to high max stress and mass. The current design\'s large stress in member_5 suggests a need to redistribute load through additional triangulation and better force paths. The mass is 26.03, within limit, but stress-to-weight ratio is too high due to stress peaks. A closed truss with proper triangulation and more evenly distributed member areas is needed. Node_3 position cannot change due to load and support constraints.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "The critical issue is stress concentration on member_5. Adding members that triangulate the lower chord between node_1, node_3, and node_2 can help. Also, repositioning the upper nodes to form a more symmetric, triangulated structure can reduce stress peaks. The current upper nodes (4,5,6) are somewhat spread out; moving them slightly to a more symmetric configuration and adding diagonal members to form closed triangles will improve load transfer. Using moderate to small areas on members near the load node to reduce mass but increasing area on highly stressed members is advisable.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Redesign the truss with 6 nodes: keep nodes 1,2,3 fixed as supports and load nodes; reposition nodes 4,5,6 to form a symmetric upper triangle centered over node_3. Connect nodes to form a closed triangulated truss: bottom chord (1-3-2), top chord (4-6-5), verticals (1-4, 2-5), diagonals (4-3, 5-3, 6-3, 6-1, 6-2). Assign areas to reduce stress peaks and maintain mass below 30. This design improves load path, symmetry, and triangulation.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Symmetry about vertical axis through node_3 balances load. Triangulation ensures structural stability and efficient load transfer. Keeping node_3 fixed respects load/support constraints. Adding node_6 at midpoint top reduces unsupported spans. Diagonals from node_3 to upper nodes distribute load from force at node_3 downward. Using area sizes 2 or 3 for main load-carrying members balances stress and mass. Smaller areas on less stressed members reduce mass. This approach should reduce max stress and stress-to-weight ratio below 0.5.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: uniform material properties, linear elastic behavior. Calculate member lengths by Euclidean distance. Member mass = length × area (area values from given dictionary). Total mass sum of all members. Estimate member forces by static equilibrium: vertical load at node_3 balanced by members connecting node_3 to supports and upper nodes. Use trigonometry to estimate force components and stress = force / area. Max stress-to-weight ratio = max(abs(stress)) / total_mass. Adjust areas iteratively to meet constraints. Node coordinates precise to 1e-2.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1 (0.00, 0.00), node_2 (6.00, 0.00), node_3 (2.00, 0.00) fixed.

Members: bottom chord (1-3,3-2), top chord (4-6,6-5), verticals (1-4,2-5), diagonals (4-3,5-3,6-3,6-1,6-2). Assign areas: main load members area_id \'3\' (1.759), secondary members area_id \'2\' (0.782), light diagonals area_id \'1\' (0.195). Calculate total mass ~26-28 (within limit).
