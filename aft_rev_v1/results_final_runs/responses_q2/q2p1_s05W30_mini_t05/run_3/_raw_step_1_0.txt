The objective is to redesign the truss to reduce maximum stress and optimize member sizing to satisfy stress-to-weight ratio <= 0.5 while keeping mass <= 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given loads at node_3, supports at nodes_1 (pinned), 2 (roller), 3 (roller). Current nodes mostly colinear on x-axis except node_4 elevated. Members include diagonals and base chords. High stress in member_4 (node_1 to node_3) causes failure. Need better triangulation and load paths to reduce stress concentration and redistribute forces.",\n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-15, -30) induces large bending and axial forces on horizontal members, especially member_4 (node_1 to node_3). Support at node_1 fixed, node_2 and node_3 rollers constrain vertical and horizontal reactions. Current design has a weak triangular system; member_4 is highly stressed due to direct load path. Member areas are uneven, with large area (4) on members 1 and 2 but small areas (1) on critical members. The structure is not fully triangulated around node_3, causing stress concentration. The total mass is acceptable but stress-to-weight ratio too high, indicating inefficient load distribution. Historic structure is same as current, no better alternative available. Node_3 position on x=2.0, y=0.0 limits vertical load transfer. Node_4 at (2.0, 3.5) provides some triangulation but member_3 (node_4 to node_2) area is small (1), limiting capacity.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress-to-weight ratio, need to improve triangulation and increase member areas on critical load paths. Avoid long horizontal members carrying bending loads alone. Possibly raise node_3 vertically to create a more stable triangle with node_4 and node_2. Keep supports and loaded nodes fixed per instructions. Adding a new node between node_3 and node_2 or repositioning node_4 can help. Use larger areas on primary load members but balance mass to stay under 30. Triangulated closed truss is critical.",\n  "proposal": "Redesign the truss by raising node_3 vertically to y=1.5 to form a strong triangle with node_4 and node_2, improving load paths. Keep node_1 and node_2 fixed on base. Add a new node_5 near midpoint between node_1 and node_2 at y=1.5 to create a more rigid trapezoidal frame with multiple triangulations. Connect members to form closed loops: node_1-node_5-node_4-node_3-node_5-node_2-node_4-node_3-node_2-node_1. Use larger area members on main load paths to reduce stress. This layout redistributes load and reduces peak stress.",\n  "reasoning": "Raising node_3 breaks the horizontal line and reduces bending in bottom chord. Adding node_5 creates a second vertical support line, enabling multiple triangulations and reducing member lengths under tension/compression. Triangulation ensures stability and load transfer efficiency. Larger cross-sectional areas on members carrying high forces reduce stress. Keeping node_1, node_2, and node_3 fixed in x,y per constraints, node_3 y is fixed at 0, so instead add node_5 elevated and reposition node_4 slightly. Since node_3 cannot move, add node_5 at (4.0,1.5) to create a triangle with node_2 and node_3. Node_4 repositioned slightly to (2.0,3.0) to improve geometry. This forms two triangles sharing node_5, better distributing forces.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Member stress proportional to axial force / area. Member length calculated by Euclidean distance. Areas chosen from given discrete set to balance mass and strength. Calculate member forces by static equilibrium approximations. Total mass = sum of (length * area). Target max stress-to-weight ratio <= 0.5 implies max stress <= 0.5 * total mass. With mass ~28, max stress <=14.
