Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller, node_3 roller. Need closed truss - currently only 3 nodes in line, no closed polygon. Must add nodes and members to form triangulated closed shape to distribute loads efficiently and reduce stress-to-weight ratio.",\n\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 is (-15 N, -30 N) direction, roughly 63.4° below horizontal. With node_1 pinned and node_2 roller, reaction forces will be at supports. Current linear geometry is unstable and cannot form closed truss. Adding nodes above the line will help triangulate and carry vertical and horizontal components. Triangulation reduces bending and stress concentrations. Members must be sized to keep max stress low and total mass under 30. Using areas from the given discrete set, smaller areas on compression members, larger on tension members can optimize weight.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Need to add at least one node above line between node_1 and node_2 to form a triangle with node_3. This creates a stable, closed truss. Possibly add one more node near node_3 to improve load path. Members: connect all nodes to form closed polygons (triangles). Avoid overly long members to reduce weight. Use smaller area for short compression members, larger for tension members under load. Check stress-to-weight ratio after sizing.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at midpoint between node_1 and node_2 but elevated on y-axis to form a triangle: (3.0, 3.0). This will help carry vertical load at node_3. Connect node_4 to node_1, node_2, and node_3, forming two triangles: node_1-node_4-node_3 and node_2-node_4-node_3. This creates a closed truss with 4 nodes. Assign areas based on member length and expected force direction: larger areas for members carrying tension, smaller for compression. This triangulation directs load efficiently to supports.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic members, uniform cross-section per member from given area IDs. Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance. Approximate internal forces by static equilibrium at nodes. Calculate member forces by resolving vertical and horizontal components of loads and reactions. Calculate member mass = length * area.
