Objective is to reduce this ratio below 0.3037 while keeping total mass ≤ 30 and max stress-to-weight ≤ 0.5.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Current structure has nodes fixed at supports and load at node_3. Members use area_ids 1 to 3 mostly. Total mass 22.52 and max stress 6.84. Constraints are met but ratio can be improved.",\n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 is downward and leftward (-15, -30). Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 and node_3 rollers. Current member stresses show member_1 highly stressed (-6.843), with large mass (3.518). Members connecting node_4 and node_5 have small areas and low stress. History shows attempts to reposition node_5 and change member areas with minor ratio changes. Larger cross sections reduce stress but increase mass. Current structure is well triangulated and closed. Failure mode likely tension in member_1 and compression in member_6. Current design is efficient but member_1 and member_2 areas could be optimized.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 and member_2 have highest stress and mass. Reducing their area while maintaining strength or redistributing load could reduce ratio. Node_5 position near node_4 and node_2 affects load path. History shows that increasing node_5 x,y beyond current degrades constraints or mass. So node_5 position near (3.85, 2.15) is near optimal. Members 7,8,9 have small areas and low stresses, good for weight saving.",\n  "proposal": "Keep fixed nodes and loads. Slightly reposition node_5 closer to node_4 to improve triangulation and reduce stress on member_1. Reduce area of member_1 and member_2 from \'3\' (1.759) to \'2\' (0.782) to save weight while checking stress limits. Keep other members same. This should reduce mass and maintain or slightly increase stress within constraints, improving ratio.",\n  "reasoning": "Load path from node_3 to supports node_1 and node_2 mainly via members 1 and 2. Reducing cross-sectional area reduces mass but increases stress. Slight reposition of node_5 improves force distribution in triangle (node_4, node_5, node_2). Triangulation maintained to avoid mechanisms. Member areas chosen from given discrete set. Node_5 moved slightly to (3.70, 2.00) to balance load paths and reduce member length.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance. Calculate mass = sum(length * area).
