  "preamble": "Optimize a 5-node planar truss under given loads and supports, minimizing stress-to-weight ratio while respecting constraints on max stress-to-weight ratio <= 0.5 and total mass <= 30. Current design has 0.3531 ratio and 20.02 mass, so improvement is targeted.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current structure has 5 nodes: 2 pinned/roller supports fixed, 1 roller with load, and 2 free nodes. Members mostly use area_id '1' or '2' with some '3'. History shows better designs have area adjustments and node 5 repositioned slightly for improved load paths.",
  
  "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-15,-30) induces compression in members from node_3 to supports and tension in upper members. Current max stress is -7.07 with mass 20.02, ratio 0.3531. History rank_1 has slightly higher mass (22.52) but better ratio (0.3037) by increasing area on member_5 and adding member_6 between node_1 and node_2. This adds triangulation and better load distribution. Node_5 shifted slightly (3.85,2.15) improves geometry for load transfer. The current design with member_6 missing may cause less optimal load path and stress concentration. Constraints are met in rank_1 and rank_2 but not in others. Node_4 and node_5 repositioning affects stress distribution significantly.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Pattern: Adding member_6 (node_1-node_2) and increasing area of critical members reduces stress peaks by providing alternate load paths. Slight repositioning of node_5 away from line between node_1 and node_2 improves triangulation and stiffness. Avoiding very small area members on critical load paths reduces stress. Current design misses member_6 which rank_1 includes. Rank_1 design best meets constraints with lower ratio but slightly higher mass.",
  
  "proposal": "Adopt rank_1 structure as base: add member_6 (node_1-node_2) with area_id '1', increase area on member_5 to '2', reposition node_5 to (3.85, 2.15). This closed truss with improved triangulation and member sizing reduces max stress and balances mass to meet constraints.",
  
  "reasoning": "Triangulation is critical to prevent mechanism and reduce stress concentration. Adding member_6 closes the lower triangle between supports and redistributes load. Increasing area on member_5 (node_3-node_4) strengthens critical diagonal under load. Node_5 repositioning breaks near-collinearity and improves stiffness. Supports fixed nodes and loaded node positions kept unchanged to respect boundary conditions. Member areas chosen from allowed set to balance mass and strength. This approach reduces max stress and keeps mass under 30.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic behavior, uniform material properties, member length from Euclidean distance. Mass = sum(length * area). Stress proportional to force / area. Force balance at nodes with supports and load. Member areas from {'0':1, '1':0.195, '2':0.782, '3':1.759, '4':3.128,...}. Use areas 3 for main chords, 2 for critical diagonals, 1 for minor members. Calculate length for each member, multiply by area to get mass. Estimate max stress from load distribution and member areas. Node_5 at (3.85,2.15) improves geometry.",
  
  "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1 (0.00,0.00), node_2 (6.00,0.00), node_3 (2.00,0.00), node_4 (3.00,3.00), node_5 (3.85,2.15). Members and areas: member_1 (node_1-node_3, '3'), member_2 (node_3-node_2, '3'), member_3 (node_1-node_4, '2'), member_4 (node_2-node_4, '2'), member_5 (node_3-node_4, '2'), member_6 (node_1-node_2, '1'), member_7 (node_4-node_5, '1'), member_8 (node_5-node_2, '1'), member_9 (node_1-node_5, '1'). Calculated total mass ~22.52 < 30. Max stress estimated ~6.84 < (0.5*22.52=11.26). Stress-to-weight ratio ~0.3037 < 0.5. Constraints met with margin.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Final design matches rank_1 best historic design, satisfies constraints with margin. Node positions fixed for loaded and supported nodes. Node_5 repositioned for better triangulation. Member areas selected to balance mass and strength. Structure fully connected and closed. No floating nodes. Stress-to-weight ratio and mass constraints met. No further improvement evident from history or analysis.",
