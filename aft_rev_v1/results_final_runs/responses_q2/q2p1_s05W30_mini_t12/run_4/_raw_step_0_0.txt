Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 and node_3 rollers. Target minimal stress to weight ratio with mass ≤30 and max(stress)/weight ≤0.5.",\n\n  "analysis": "The three nodes laid out on x-axis [0,0], [6,0], [2,0] with a downward-left load on node_3 create bending moments. No initial triangulation, only line members imply poor lateral stability and inefficient load distribution. Structure is not closed or triangulated, which is necessary to resist applied lateral load, avoid mechanism modes and reduce stress. Members must create a stable triangular or polygonal framework. Stress concentration likely on direct members connecting node_3 to supports. Incorporating a strategically placed node off-axis will enable triangulation and more effective distribution.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Load direction needs a vertical and horizontal reaction at node_1 pinned to balance. Roller support at node_2 (horizontal freedom) requires load transfer primarily toward node_1. Collinear original nodes insufficient for closure and stability. Introducing an intermediate 4th node above base axis near node_3 will enable multiple load paths and better triangulation. Also wise to add members from this new node back to both node_1 and node_2 to create two triangles sharing a member, reducing stress and weight.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Add one new node (node_4) above on the vertical line approximately halfway between nodes 2 and 3 for better triangulation. Connect node_4 to node_1, node_2, and node_3 forming two triangular cells, eliminating collinearity. Choose minimal cross-sectional areas prioritizing lower area_ids due to modest quantified loads. Longer members connecting to node_4 require medium areas balance to remain under mass limit. Assuming uniform material density equal on per unit length per area. This configuration improves stiffness, optimizes transfer paths, distributes forces into structure hence reducing maximal stress and total weight.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Axial forces dominate, members carry tension/compression, ignore buckling, uniform density with area-length product for mass. Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance. Estimated force distribution allocates load to members attached to node_3 and transfers to supports. Calculate total weight = sum(length × area_coeff). Stress roughly proportional to axial force / area.
