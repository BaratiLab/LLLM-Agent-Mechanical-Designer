Objective: ensure full connectivity, maintain structural efficiency, and satisfy stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 0.5 and mass ≤ 30 constraints.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Initial structure has 3 nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0). Load at node_3: 15N at -30°. Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller, node_3 roller. Closed truss requires at least a triangle or more to avoid kinematic instability. Currently all nodes collinear, not stable for load with roller supports at node_2 and node_3.",\n  \n  "analysis": "With collinear nodes all on x-axis, and roller supports at node_2 and node_3, structure lacks vertical restraint and will be unstable with lateral load. Load at node_3 (-15N, -30°) has downward component ≈ -7.5N and horizontal component ≈ -13N. Without vertical support at node_2 and node_3, vertical deflections large. So, need at least one additional strategically placed node off the line (x axis) for triangulation and closed structure. The minimum closed polygon is a quadrilateral or triangle with added nodes to form triangulated bracing. Stress-to-weight ratio minimized by efficiently distributing load via triangulation, avoiding excessive member forces, and choosing mid-range areas to limit mass.Sideways force due to load can be resolved via a triangular configuration providing compression and tension members comfortably holding internal forces within ranges.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Insight: The original nodes along horizontal line are inadequate. Adding one apex node above the base line creates two triangles: (node_1, node_2, new_node) and (node_1, new_node, node_3). This triangulates and stabilizes structure. Optimal location likely somewhere above node_3, near midpoint between node_1 and node_2 for better load distribution. Member selection with light-to-medium areas (area_id \'2\' or \'3\') preferable for weight reduction but must be tuned after force calculations. Triangulated truss will safely distribute the horizontal and vertical components of the load from node_3.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Add a single node (\'node_4\') above nodes line at approximately x=3.5, y=3.0 for stability and triangulation. Members connecting node_4 to node_1, node_2, and node_3 form a closed truss of four nodes and five members ensuring statically determinate conditions. Members choices based on axial force: top chords are often tension, bottom chord mostly compression depending on load direction. Select areas for light members on shorter segments and heavier on longer load-path members. Ensure total mass ≤ 30 and stress-to-weight ≤ 0.5 by adjusting area_id accordingly to reduce mass while handling forces.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Truss members only axial forces; pinned joints at supports; load applied at node_3; members are straight lines. Steps: Calculate member lengths, unit vectors, solve static equilibrium for member forces, calculate stress in each member (assuming constant cross-sectional area from area_id database), compute weight (sum length times area), derive max(abs(stress)) and stress-to-weight ratio. Iterative selection of area_ids minimized mass while satisfying stress constraints.
