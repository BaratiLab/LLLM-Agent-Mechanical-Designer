Goal: minimize max stress/weight ratio further while satisfying mass ≤30, maintaining support constraints, and structural closure.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given structure has nodes: two supports fixed (node_1 pinned, node_2 roller) and node_3 roller; load applied at node_3 as force (-15, -30). Current members create closed truss with two base members and three upper/fork members forming a triangular shape. Members sized mostly as area ids \'2\', \'3\', and \'4\'. Constraints accepted but better efficiency with lower max stress-to-weight ratio score seen in historic ranks (best at 0.409 vs current 0.4794).\\nParameters: max allowable ratio 0.5, mass ≤30.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current load is concentrated down-left at node_3 which connects base nodes and middle-top node_4. The support at node_1 is pinned (fully restrained) while node_2 and node_3 are rollers, allowing horizontal displacements at those nodes. Current members are sized moderately heavily (areas 2,3,4). Member 1 (node_1-node_3) is max stressed (compression) at -11.26. Member 5 (node_4 to node_3) carries low tensile stress (~1.38).\\nGeneration history ranks show designs increasing the cross-sectional area of upper diagonal member_5 from 4 to 5 lowers max stress from 11.26 to ~11.07 and improves ratio from 0.4794 to ~0.409 with slight mass increase (~27 vs 23.48).\\nLarger area crowds mass but relieves stress concentration. Triangulated geometry kept consistent for structural stability and load path continuity.\\nLoad transfer predominantly from node_3 diagonally up to node_4 then down to base supports. Structural efficiency improves with enhancing upper diagonal thickness to take forces, keeping other members trimmed.\\nCurrent geometry can remain fixed; better sizing in members will leverage already optimized geometry and nodal constraints prevent position adjustments except node_4 moves mildly.\\nFully connected structure and geometry integrity ok; continuation of this triangulated 4-node, 5-member assembly is best.\\nNo isolated nodes detected. Current design met constraints, historic shows potential to improve by tuning member 5 from area \'4\' to \'5\'.",\n \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Clear from history best designs have member_5 with area \'5\' (4.887) vs \'4\' (3.128). Member_5 is mildly stressed tensile, making it critical to boost to area \'5\' to cut stress ratio by lowering max stress overall.\\nMass trade-off of ~3-4 extra units is valid because stress reduction above 11 is halved to ~0.9, improving stress-to-weight ratio.\\nPosition tweaks of node_4 between 1.79 and 1.8 don\'t materially affect max stress much - current 1.8 is acceptable.\\nMembers_1,2 remain area \'2\'; members_3,4 area \'3\' prevents excess mass expansion while safely supporting load.\\nNo new members required as added member_6 was tested and drastically lowered mass but violated constraints badly with higher stress, no gain.\\nStructural symmetry and triangulation advantageous; node movements restricted by support and load placements.\\nTo minimize ratio: adjust member sizing primarily focused on member_5 area elevation with slight position stabilization at node_4 around y=1.8 (current 1.81 is near-optimal, can be reset to 1.8).",\n \n  "proposal": "Select historically best high-rank design: node_4 at (3.00, 1.80), same nodes and base layout.
