    "preamble" :  "Optimize a 4-node, 6-member planar truss carrying a -15 kN horizontal and -30 kN vertical load at node_3, supported by pinned (node_1) and roller supports (node_2, node_3). Current max stress-to-weight ratio is 0.2277, constraints under 0.5 stress/weight and 30 total mass.",

    "scratch_pad_1": "Current configuration has reasonable mass (26.88) and max stress (6.12). Members use area_id 1,2,3 varying from ~0.195 to ~1.759. Structure is closed and connected via node_4 elevated at (3.2, 4.0) providing triangulation.",

    "analysis": "Loads at node_3 induce tension/compression mainly in members connected to it: member_1 and member_2 with largest cross-sections. The triangle formed with node_4 reduces bending moments and helps distribute stress. Member_6 connects support nodes and helps stiffness but has large mass (10.554). Maximum stress is at member_1, confirmed by history. Larger area on member_6 (area_id='3') adds weight; smaller cross section increases stresses. Constraint limits are met, and structure is efficient but can mass be trimmed by shifting areas or node_4 position? Slight lowering of node_4 elongates members 3,4,5 possibly lowering tensile/compressive forces by changing angles.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Mass > 25 yet < 30, ample margin for area reduction especially for heaviest member_6. Stress is dominated at member_1; stress at member_4 and member_3 minimal. Possibly member_4 area (currently '1' = 0.195) can be slightly increased or node_4 lowered for better force path optimizing stress. Node_3 fixed by load: can't reposition. Constraint #1 met comfortably.",

    "proposal": "Keep nodes_1,2,3 fixed. Lower node_4 from (3.20, 4.00) to approximately (3.10, 3.70) to optimize force path and redistribute stress from member_1 and member_6. Adjust member areas to reduce mass on member_6 from '3' (1.759) to '2' (0.782) and slightly raise area on members with peak stresses (member_1 from '3' to '4'). This balances mass and stress and should decrease the max stress-to-weight ratio below current 0.2277.",

    "reasoning": "Lowering node_4 reduces length and bending moment arm, shifting force path from heavier members to lighter ones. Small area increase on highly stressed members improves strength without much adding mass. Reducing cross section area on member_6, which shows relatively low stresses (-1.2151) but contributes biggest mass will help reduce total mass significantly.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic stress proportional to axial force. Member length computed by Euclidean distance; mass = length * area_density (from area_id map). Stress TO weight = max absolute stress / total_mass. Adjust node_4 y from 4.00 to 3.70 reduces member length by ~7.5%. Force redistribution assumed; stress on member_1 expected to reduce from ~6.12 to ~5.50 (10% drop). Member_6 mass reduces from 10.554 to ~4.7 by area_id change. Increased area id on member_1 from 3 (1.759) to 4 (3.128) nearly doubles cross-sectional area thus reduces stress by ~45% on that member. Calculate updated masses and confirm stress-to-weight <0.5 and total mass <30.",

    "calculation": "Updated node_4 = (3.20, 3.70). Member lengths approx: m1=3.23, m2=4.12, m3=4.09, m4=3.44, m5=3.05, m6=6.00 m\nMember areas after proposed update: member_1='4'=3.128, member_2='3'=1.759, member_3='2'=0.782 (no change), member_4='1'=0.195 (unchanged), member_5='1'=0.195 (lowered from 1), member_6='2'=0.782\nMasses approx: m1=10.10, m2=7.24, m3=3.20, m4=0.67, m5=0.59, m6=4.69 => total ~26.49 kg\nMax stress approx scaled down on member_1 by 45%: stress ~3.36, Member_6 stress maintained <2.0.\nStress to weight ~3.36/26.49 = 0.127<0.2277 current much improved. Total mass < 30 constraints hold well.\nNo constraint violated.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "Design meets constraints with comfortable margin on mass and maximal stress-to-weight ratio lowered significantly. Node_4 lowered vertical coordinate optimized load path and allowed significant mass reduction by downsizing member_6 and slight area increase in member_1 to handle stress shift. Structure remains closed and connected, with symmetry and valid support conditions. No node with loads or supports moved.",
