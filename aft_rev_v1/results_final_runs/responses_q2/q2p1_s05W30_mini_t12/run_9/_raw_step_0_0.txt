Load of 15 units downward-left at node_3. Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 and node_3 rollers. Goal: close the open line into a stable, triangulated, closed truss. Area choices from given discrete values. Constraints: stress-to-weight ≤ 0.5 and total mass ≤ 30. Structure must be fully connected—consider adding a fourth node above ground to enable triangulation.",\n  \n    "analysis": "Current setup is a colinear 3-node line structure which is unstable under lateral loads; open and not fully connected in 2D sense. Load at node_3 creates bending stresses in members between nodes and likely large tensile/compressive forces. Supports provide one reaction at node_1 and vertical ones at node_2 and node_3 rollers, insufficient for out-of-plane stability or lateral resistance. Without additional nodes, truss cannot be closed in 2D as all members align horizontally—no triangles to distribute load efficiently.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding at least one node above the baseline to produce triangle(s) is necessary. Node placement should create efficient load paths and maintain minimum weight. Near node_3, placing a node at around (2.0, 3.5) gives an isosceles triangle with base 6 units lightened mass. Triangulation stiffness helps reduce max member stress by converting bending to axial loads. Use small cross-sectional area members at low axial forces; size critical diagonals larger. Also, distributing cross section strategically along tension and compression members will reduce max stress/weight ratio.",\n  \n    "reasoning": "Place node_4 at (2.00, 3.50) to form closed triangular shape with existing nodes: triangles (1,2,4) and (2,3,4). Connect \'node_4\' to all base and loaded nodes: members (1-4), (2-4), (3-4) plus base members (1-2), (2-3), (3-1). This provides stable triangulation, vertical and diagonal load paths. Use smaller area members for less stressed base chords and larger areas for loaded diagonals near node_3 to handle tensile loads produced by load vector at node_3. Aim total mass under 30. Iteratively choose minimum viable cross-sectional areas from area IDs balancing stress and total weight.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Member length is Euclidean distance between connected nodes, mass = length × area. All loads considered at nodes as point loads, supports ideal pins/rollers fully restricting required DOF. Stress proportional to axial forces in members estimated by static equilibrium at nodes. Set up: sum forces horizontal and vertical = 0 per node; solve for member forces then calculate stress = force/area. Candidate area_id to area mapping factored in to select smallest that satisfy stress limit with overhead. Calculate total length×area sum and max(abs(stress)). Adjustments iterate if constraints unsatisfied. Use basic trigonometry for lengths: e.g., dist(node_1, node_4) = sqrt((2-0)^2+(3.5-0)^2) ≈ 4.03.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2,3.5).

Choose members (1-2) and (3-1) area_id=\'1\' (0.195), (2-3) area_id=\'2\' (0.782), and diagonal members (1-4), (2-4), (3-4) area_id=\'4\' (3.128) for higher load. Total mass = length×area sum = 6*0.195 + 4*0.782 +2*0.195 + 4.03*3.128*3 ≈ 1.17 +3.13 +0.39 + 37.8 = approx 42.5 too high => reduce diagonals to area_id=\'3\' (1.759): diagonals mass ~4.03*1.759*3=21.3 Mass total = 1.17 + 3.13 + 0.39 +21.3=25.99 <30 okay. Estimate max axial force at node_3 loaded with -15 N vector (-30°): around 23N tension/compression in diagonals. Stress = force/area. For area=1.759 units -> max stress = 23 /1.759 =13.08 -> ensure max stress normalized to unit? Ratio = max(abs(stress))/total_weight = 13.08/25.99=0.503 marginally over limit. Try smaller area_id=\'2\' (0.782) on one diagonal (3-4) to reduce mass, offsetting others. Adjust members for stress convergence. Final settle on diagonals (1-4=\'3\'), (2-4=\'3\'), (3-4=\'2\').
