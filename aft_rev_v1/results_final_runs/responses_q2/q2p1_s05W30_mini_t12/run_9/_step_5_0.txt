  "preamble": "Optimize a small 2D truss with fixed/load/support nodes to reduce stress-to-weight ratio from 0.3194 to below 0.5, maintaining closed connectivity and under 30 mass units.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current structure has loads at node_3 (-15, -30), supports pinned at node_1, rollers at node_2 and node_3. Node_4 raised slightly improved ratio to 0.3131 but lost mass efficiency. Member cross sections mostly at areas 1 to 3 with heavier on main bottom chords.",
  "analysis": "Load at node_3 applies downward-left force requiring strong node_3 connectivity and proper support at node_1 pinned and rollers at nodes 2 & 3 enforce constraints. High stress negative (-7.2) on member_1 consistently indicates tension/compression peak. The topology connecting node_5 as intermediate reduces overall height. Current masses and stresses satisfy constraints. Generation history shows raising node_4 slightly helps stress distribution. Constraint-violating structures employ big cross sections and heavier masses; design must avoid that. Members from node_1 to node_5 and node_3 stabilize, forming a closed polygon. Elastic stress should remain below yielded max stress deduced from allowed ratio.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Triangular connectivity with node_5 at mid-height balances load well. Need to slightly adjust node_4 up within constraint to distribute stress and keep member_3 and member_4 cross-sections stable. Member_1 biggest stress contributor. Should keep pinned node_1 and node_2/3 rollers fixed as per constraints. Smaller cross sections on secondary members reduce mass. Target stress balance between compression and tension.",
  "proposal": "Retain the topology and connectivity of rank_1 design with node_4 raised to 5.2 to distribute stresses better. Slightly increase cross section area of member_1 from '3' to '4' to reduce peak stress while controlling mass. Keep other member cross sections mostly same or reduced where stress is low, e.g. member_7 to '1'. Node positions mostly unchanged except float node_4 y raised 5.2 for better height.",
  "reasoning": "Increase cross section area in high stress member_1 to lower stress by spreading load while slightly balancing mass increase. Rationale: Tension/compression concentrated in member_1. Raising node_4 improves vertical triangulation distributing forces better. Smaller cross sections on low stress members reduce weight. Keep all members part of closed structure ensuring load paths and stability. Calculations approximate member length × area mass; stresses inversely proportional to area for similar load.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths from node coordinates. Calculate member mass = length × area. Sum all for total mass. Max stress inversely proportional to square root of cross-sectional area approx. Check max_stress/total_mass <= 0.5 and total_mass <= 30. Iterate only modifying member_1 area from 3 to 4 reduces max stress by about sqrt(3/4)=0.866 factor. Increase mass of member_1 proportionally: length unchanged, area multiplier 3.128 (area_id 4) vs 1.759 (area_id 3). Check total mass increase is acceptable. Verify all supports, loads fixed per rule. Nodes 1, 2, 3 fixed, node_4 y = 5.2, node_5 same.",
  "calculation": "Member_1 length ≈ distance between (0.0,0.0) and (2.0,0.0) = 2.0 m. Mass with area_id 3 =2*1.759=3.518, with area_id 4=2*3.128=6.256 mass units. Increase by ≈2.7 units, total current mass ~23 increases to ~25.7. Stress reduces by factor ~0.866, original max_stress=7.2 lowers to approx. 6.23. Then max_stress/total_mass = 6.23/25.7=0.24 < 0.5. Other members retention keeps mass near current with minor adjustments. Confirm constraint satisfaction.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Final structure has increased sectional area in most critical member_1, node_4 raised to 5.2 for height. Member masses and stiffness balanced to reduce peak stress at acceptable mass increase below whitelist 30. Structure remains closed, connected, supports and loads unchanged meet all constraints. Stress-to-weight ratio substantially improved to ~0.24. Good trade-off.",
