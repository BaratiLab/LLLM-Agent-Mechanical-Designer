Objective is to redesign a fully triangulated closed truss retaining supports and load nodes to satisfy all constraints and minimize stress-to-weight ratio.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "The load is at node_3 down-left; supports fix node_1 pinned and node_2 and node_3 rollers along base line y=0. Existing structure has lightly loaded top node_4 at (3,4). Members use area_ids mostly \'2\' (0.782) with some smaller areas. Mass of member_3 is large due to zero area member usage indicating a zero force member which is not effective. Stress overloads most occur in member_1 (-14.86) exceeding ratio allowed.",\n  "analysis": "Current violations arise from excessively stressed member_1 spanning node_1 to node_3 heavy area combined with zero area member_3 between node_1 to node_2 carrying a small former but creating imbalance. Structural inefficiency results from node_3 roller support adjacent to load node causing large shear forces on short member_1. Also, node_4 positioned too high (y=4) creating long compressed members without load paths reducing mass efficiency. Member sizes poorly distributed leading to overstressed slender members and unnecessarily heavy chords. Historical designs show less optimal distributed members and higher stress-to-weight, suggesting redesign rather than reuse.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "The main failure pattern is an under-dimensioned or overstressed member_1 due to poor load transfer from node_3 to pinned node_1. Presence of roller at node_3 on base adds little vertical restraint exacerbating stresses. Heavy mass on base chord member_3 confirmed as inefficient. The top node\'s position and enclosing members not effectively triangulated cause bending stresses rather than pure axial, raising stress-to-weight ratio.",\n  "proposal": "Redesign node_4 position lower at about 2.8 m height with all triangular members fully connected and increase areas of critical members transferring load from node_3 to pinned node_1. Set node_3 position fixed. Adjust member connection to remove zero area member on base and add more triangular members for stiffness enhancement. Use area_ids = \'3\' or higher for key tension/compression members (lower stress-to-weight achievable) while keeping total mass under 30. This achieves a closed triangular portal frame geometry.",\n  "reasoning": "By applying fundamental truss design principles: (1) forces resolved axially in members; (2) triangulate all nodes to avoid bending stresses; (3) keep load node connected by strong tension/compression members to supports; (4) reduce length of heavily loaded members; (5) optimize area assignment matching forces to member capacity. Moving top node lower shortens high compressive members and balances forces better. Replacing zero area base chord by a nonzero area member ensures balanced distribution of moment and equilibrium at base. This system elevates vertical stiffness and lowers max stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Set node_1: (0.00, 0.00) pinned; node_2: (6.00, 0.00) roller; node_3: (2.00, 0.00) roller with load (-15N x, -30N y). Place node_4 at (3.10, 2.80) to reduce height and member length. Members (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), (node_1-node_2) form base triangle; (node_1-node_4), (node_2-node_4), (node_3-node_4) form upper triangles. Use area_ids: \'4\' (3.128) for main load paths (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2), \'3\' (1.759) for secondary chords and \'1\' (0.195) for top small members.
