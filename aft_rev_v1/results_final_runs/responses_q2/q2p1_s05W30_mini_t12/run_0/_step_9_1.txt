  "preamble": "Optimize a 2D truss currently satisfying constraints with load at node_3 and supports at nodes_1, 2, 3. Objective: minimize stress-to-weight ratio below 0.5 while total mass ≤ 30, improving or confirming best design from iteration 8.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current design nodes are fixed except for free node_4; member areas vary from 1 to 4; max stress-to-weight ratio is 0.1571 well below constraint 0.5; total mass ~26.17 is under limit 30. Existing design is statically determinate and closed with triangle connections allowing good load path from load at node_3 to supports.",
  
  "analysis": "Loads on node_3 (-15, -30) create tension/compression mainly in members connected to node_3. Members 1 and 2 carry main axial loads to supports. Node_4 acts as a bracing point stabilizing the top. Member stresses show highest absolute stress in member_1 (~4.1) under compression, with large area 4. Member_6 joins node_3 to node_4 with smaller area 1 and moderate stress ~1.19 tension. Total mass distributed with more mass on highly stressed members. History shows attempts at reducing area or moving node_4 resulted in unstable or constraint-violating designs due to increased peak stresses or loss of closure. Current design is minimum weight stable truss with stress well within limits. Possible failure mode was due to node_4 position or areas reduced below able to carry force.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns indicate maintaining member_1 and member_2 both at area_id '4' prevents overstress under loading. Members 4 and 5 can have smaller area (2) and member_6 smallest area (1) sustaining bracing. Node_4 vertical offset correlates with stress reduction in member_1, evidenced by historic violations upon vertical displacement away from ~3.1. This stability supports maintaining node_4 near current y=3.1. No floating nodes. Use symmetric layout and triangulation.",
  
  "proposal": "Choose to further optimize current design by slight adjustment of node_4 y-coordinate (fine tuning within ±0.1) and confirming member_4 and member_5 remain at area 2, member_6 area 1, members 1 and 2 stay at large area 4 for high load. Slight vertical increase of node_4 may relieve compression in member_1 and reduce stress-to-weight ratio further while keeping total mass under 30.",
  
  "reasoning": "The truss is statically determinate and stable due to triangulated layout. The loaded node_3 connecting two large area members ensures load transfer to supports. Smallest area member_6 braces node_4 to node_3. By raising node_4 slightly, axial compression forces in member_1 may decrease as load path stiffens, possibly reducing max stress. Given the history, drastic repositioning or size reduction failed, therefore tuning node_4 vertical position is the best approach. The mass remains under limit by keeping members' area sizes unchanged. Node_1, 2, 3 are fixed due to supports and loads. Optimizing node_4 y only respects boundary conditions fully.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Member lengths from proportional distances; member volume ∝ length × area (area per 'area_id' mapping provided); stress proportional to force/area. Calculate member forces using static equilibrium at nodes with loads; sum vertical and horizontal forces. Use exact geometry to compute member lengths and unit vectors. Iterate node_4 y-axis position in steps of 0.05 from 3.0 to 3.2 and compute max stress and mass to find minimum stress-to-weight ratio below 0.1571. Fix areas: members 1 & 2 -> '4', 4 & 5 -> '2', 6 -> '1'. Node height tuning to balance compression in member_1 and tension in 6 for optimized distribution.",
  
  "calculation": "At node_4 = y=3.15: member lengths (approx): (1-4)=3.665, (2-4)=3.665, (3-4)=3.32. Member masses: member_4 & 5 = 3.665*0.782=2.86 each, member_6=3.32*0.195=0.65 approx. Total mass sum close to 6.26 + 12.51 + 2*2.86 + 0.65=~25.14 < 30. Estimated stresses redistribute slightly: compression member_1 approx -3.8, tension member_6 approx 1.0, reducing max stress from 4.1 to ~3.8, thus stress-to-weight ratio reduced to approx 0.15 from 0.1571. Constraint of maximum stress-to-weight ratio < 0.5 and total mass < 30 met comfortably. Further vertical increase upsets balance, and lower diminishes stiffness. Chose node_4 y=3.15.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Final design maintains load/support node positions and member areas as best from iteration 8; node_4 refined coordinate slightly upward to y=3.15 for improved stress distribution and lowered max stress-to-weight ratio to ~0.15, marginal improvement but respects constraints comfortably. Structure remains closed and statically determinate, stable under the given loading and supports.",
  
  "stop": "True # Current design is very efficient with stress-to-weight ratio far under 0.5, total mass under 30, limited manual fine-tuning possible without constraint violation or instability.",
