Objective is to produce an optimized closed 2D truss structure minimizing stress-to-weight ratio while respecting constraints.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_1": "The problem involves a 4-node truss with the load applied downward-laterally at node_3. Constraints require the max stress-to-weight ratio <= 0.5 and total mass <= 30. The current structure has members sized mostly at areas \'1\', \'2\', and \'3\' with moderate mass. Constraints are violated primarily by peak stress in member_1 at ~15 ksi and nonoptimal load paths. Some members carry light stress potentially useful to shed load from high stress members.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current boundary supports fix node_1 pinned, node_2 and node_3 rollers restricting movement at base. Load at node_3 causes large negative stress in member_1 (node_1-node_3) which is highly stressed due to direct load path and short length. Node_4 positioned at about (3.02, 3.55) forms a near triangle with nodes 1, 2 and 3 but the member_4 and member_5 connecting node_4 to boundary nodes have large cross sections and heavy mass indicating inefficient force transfer. The structure is symmetric horizontally with an open V-ish shape but not optimally triangulated. Historical structures showed lower mass and higher stress ratios or higher mass but still above 0.5 ratio, indicating a tradeoff. Members in histories also show some overly loaded and others underutilized.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "The trend of member portions suggests that to reduce stress-to-weight, the load at node_3 must be efficiently distributed between members connecting node_3 with node_1 and node_4, and to node_2. Moving node_4 higher slightly or changing triangle geometry to reduce member_1 force and shorten members will help. Choosing varied but slightly smaller member sizes, relying on more triangulation to share stresses, tends to reduce critical stress. Overall improvements require better triangulation at upper section, less mass in heavily loaded members, and maintaining connectivity while rigidly supporting load directions.",\n\n  "proposal": "Redesign structure by refining node_4 position to increase overall joint stiffness, keeping nodes with loads and supports fixed. Add full triangulation between nodes to eliminate flexibility and enable more evenly distributed stress. Select cross-sectional areas smaller or equal where feasible while maintaining strength. Use area \'1\'(0.195) or \'2\'(0.782) for highly stressed members, bigger areas only if indispensable. Remove weakest/least effective heavy cross-section in members showing underutilization. Maintain a closed quadrilateral with internal diagonals.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Triangulation improves stiffness and strength, reducing peak stresses. Moving node_4 upward slightly enhances leverage reducing axial loads on base members. Maintaining pinned and roller supports unmodified satisfies boundary condition constraints. Choose members efficiently sized by estimating length and forces per assumed truss theory of pin-jointed frames under diagonal load. Estimations indicate node_4 put about 4.3 m above base improves load path. Distribute cross-sectional areas in descending magnitude: highest areas at shortest members under large compressive tension, mid areas at diagonals, and lowest equal areas at base chord. Expectably, stress-to-weight ratio reduces to below 0.5 with total mass well within 30.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Use node coordinates: node_1(0.00,0.00), node_2(6.00, 0.00), node_3(2.00, 0.00), node_4(3.10,4.30).

Calculate member lengths by Euclidean distance: e.g., member_1(1-3)=2.0m, member_4(1-4)=4.9m, etc. Applied load at node_3 (-15, -30) N arbitrarily scaled due to historic example (adjust with units but consistency is key).
