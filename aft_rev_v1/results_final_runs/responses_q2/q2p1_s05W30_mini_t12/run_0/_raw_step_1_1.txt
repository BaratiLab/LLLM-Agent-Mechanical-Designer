Total mass is below max allowed but max stress is high in member_1 causing excessive stresses. The objective is to redesign a fully connected closed 2D truss satisfying stress-to-weight ratio <=0.5 and mass <=30, minimizing mass while meeting supports and loads without moving supported or loaded nodes.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Initial design has nodes mostly coaxial along X-axis with a single vertical offset node_4 at (2.0,3.0). Heavy stress in member connecting supports to loaded node_3, indicating poor load transfer. Current dense members on large areas cause high mass but still excess stress.",\n\n    "analysis": "Loads: node_3 at (2,0) bears force (-15,-30), supported by pinned (node_1 at 0,0) and rollers at node_2 (6,0) and node_3. Current members have large areas leading to mass=17.57 but max stress=44.08 is too high causing the stress-weight ratio violation. The horizontal base from node_1 to node_2 with a mid node_3 cannot effectively transfer vertical load. Member_2 is zero area (inactive), creating inefficient load path. The top node (node_4) attempts triangulation but member_6 is heavy and under mild tension. The structure is not optimally triangulated to efficiently reduce bending and axial forces, especially near the load at node_3. To better transfer the vertical load and reduce member forces, reconfiguration is needed to balance axial forces via triangulation and minimal cross sectional areas.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key issues: member_1 heavily loaded (causing high stress in that member), member_2 unused (area=0), and large cross sections increasing mass. Load lies downward vertical and horiz -30 vertical, -15 horiz at node_3 requiring vertical and horizontal reactions. Inefficient horizontal base limits distribution, requiring a structure with improved stability by adding nodes and cross bracing ensuring load path is triangulated. Considering symmetry and minimal nodes with a trapezoidal or triangular shape connected between supports would better distribute load.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss to a 4-node trapezoidal closed structure: keep nodes_1 and 2 fixed with supports at (0,0) and (6,0), fix node_3 loaded at (2,0). Add a new node_4 at (3.0, 3.0) to form triangular bracing between nodes 1,3,4 and nodes 2,3,4. Connect all nodes in a closed triangulated manner (including diagonal crosses between node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4) to effectively carry loads. Use smaller areas selectively on high-force members to reduce mass. Assign area from set {\'1\':\'0.195\', \'2\':\'0.782\'} for load carrying members to reduce mass while safely lowering stress. Node_4 height optimized at 3.0m to provide strong vertical triangulation.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Triangular truss structures transfer axial loads efficiently and minimize bending stresses. Height of node_4 allows the panels to carry vertical forces in compression/tension appropriately, reducing bending in horizontal chords. Adding diagonals connects nodes to improve load paths and stability. Smaller areas on diagonals reduce weight while offloading large forces from longer chords. Node coordinates of supports and loads fixed as protected. The load applied at node_3 downward -30 and -15 horizontal will create tension and compression members distributing load evenly. Cross bracing ensures no member is overly stressed.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths between connected nodes using Euclidean distance. Assign areas so max stress/weight <=0.5 where max stress related to axial force length/(area * allowable stress). Approximate stresses based on typical force division in triangulated patterns. Estimate length * area as member mass proxy. Use area ids \'1\' for small, \'2\' for medium as initial estimate.
