Goal is to minimize stress-to-weight ratio without exceeding constraints on this ratio (≤0.5) and total mass (≤30).",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes: 3 points mostly aligned on x-axis with node_3 loaded diagonally (-15, -30). Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 and node_3 rollers. Current 3 nodes only form a simple, open, almost linear condition. Need to introduce at least one new node to create a triangulated closed truss to properly distribute loads and reduce stresses.",\n\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 is a downward and leftward force. Supports provide vertical and horizontal reactions: pinned at node_1 restrains all but rotation, roller supports allow horizontal or vertical movement respectively. Current members connecting only nodes 1-2, 2-3, 1-3 are insufficiently triangulated; this causes bending and higher axial stress in members. Without triangulation, members will see large unbalanced forces. Adding node_4 between nodes 2 and 3 above the axis creates two triangles: (1,2,4) and (1,4,3), enclosing the structure, distributing axial forces better, lowering maximum stress. Suitably sizing members (via area_id) ensures stresses remain low without high weight.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key insight: create an upper node 4 slightly above node_2-node_3 line at about y=2 ensures strong triangulation, retains closed frame, and spreads load from node_3 to structure corners. The load has a strong vertical component that the pinned support at node_1 can address if struts above distribute it. Choose larger area members in high-load directions and smaller in lower-stress members to minimize weight.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (4.0, 2.0) to form triangles (node_1-node_2-node_4) and (node_1-node_4-node_3). Members: 1-2, 2-4, 4-1, 1-3, 3-4, 2-3. The repeated diagonal members help resist shear and bending forces from directional load at node_3. Set area_ids as: highest axial force members at 3 (1.759) or 4 (3.128) area, lower load members at 1 (0.195) or 2 (0.782), minimal weight면서 stability maintained. This balances weight and stress constraints.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths by Euclidean distance; calculate axial load per member assuming static equilibrium in x and y directions (ΣFx=0, ΣFy=0) and moment equilibrium about pinned node_1.
