The optimization aims to generate a closed 2D truss that meets stress-weight ratio and mass constraints while retaining load and support node positions.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Load applied at node_3 is (-15.0, -30.0). Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 (roller). Nodes mostly colinear on x-axis except node_4 elevated (3.0, 3.5). Current members insufficiently triangulate tall triangle causing high stress (particularly member_4 at -64.55). Mass distributed asymmetrically with overloaded members.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design forms a single triangle with added diagonal (node_4 to node_1), low cross-sectional areas cause high stress concentration notably at member_4 (node_3-node_1, area_id \'1\'). The max stress far exceeds limits. History shows improved stress ratios with additional nodes near node_4 area indicating the need for better triangulation and load path redundancy. Existing designs with 4-5 nodes adding connections from node_4 to others reduce stresses to under allowed 0.5 ratio but at costs of mass near the 30 limit. Key issue is insufficient triangulation and rigid connections near loaded roller node_3.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "All successful historic structures add nodes above and beside node_4 or between node_4 and node_3 providing vertical and diagonal load paths. Increasing cross sectional areas mainly on primary load carrying members helps reduce stress. We need to keep node_3 static as per instruction and preserve supports/nodes with loads for boundary conditions.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Propose to redesign structure adding an additional support node between node_3 and node_4 elevated vertically to enhance triangulation and load-carrying redundancy. Position: about (2.0, 2.0). Construct members connecting node_3-node_5, node_5-node_4, and possibly node_5-node_1 to form closed triangulated sections. Use moderate area sections (\'2\' or \'3\') along main load path and smaller areas (\'1\') on secondary members. This adheres to constraints and avoids isolated nodes.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 at (2.0, 2.0) creates efficient vertical and diagonal trusses to distribute the load mainly pulling down at node_3. The triangular arrangements ensure that tension and compression members balance forces effectively, reducing maximum stress in any one member. Area choices follow typical optimization rules: larger for heavily loaded members, small for stability bars. Preserves original load/support nodes untouched as required.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assume 2D static equilibrium: sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, sum Moments=0. Calculate member lengths per coordinates. Estimate member forces by method of joints considering applied load at node_3 (-15,-30). Evaluate stress as force / (area × member geometry). Stress-to-weight ratio computed as max absolute stress / total mass, ensure <0.5; total mass computed from sum(length × area), ensure <30; use area values from input dictionary. Adjust areas primarily for longest/high force members.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node positions: node_1(0.00,0.00), node_2(6.00,0.00), node_3(2.00,0.00), node_4(3.00,3.20), node_5(2.00,2.00).
