Previous designs failed constraints: stress-to-weight ratio > 0.5 and mass > 30. Objective is to redesign a fully triangulated closed truss with redistributed nodes and members to satisfy mass ≤ 30 and stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 0.5.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "The load is concentrated at node_3 downward-left, with supports heavily restraining nodes 1 (pinned), 2 and 3 (rollers). Current structure is primarily linear at bottom (nodes 1,2,3 all on y=0). Node_4 is elevated at y=2.2 but the connections inadequately balance internal stress and mass. Member_4 suffers highest stress (-4.13), indicating load path inefficiency and possible overstress. Generation history shows many infeasible attempts due to high stress or excessive mass.",\n  "analysis": "Load applied at node_3 requires effective triangulated supports to distribute forces to pins/rollers. Bottom-line nodes co-linear on y=0 leads to inefficient load transfer and bending modes in the truss members. Use of thicker members on longer spans increases mass, violating mass constraint. Members show tension and compression cycles with large extremes, especially member_4. Previous attempts that introduce more nodes and triangulation helped marginally but failed either on mass or too high stress. The ideal structure needs to separate load paths effectively with reduced span lengths and optimal member areas, mainly by raising load-carrying nodes vertically for better asymmetry and triangulation.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on a four-node triangular framework reforming node_3 and node_4 heights to relieve load on member_4. Possibly raise node_4 higher vertically and shift node_3 further toward right to increase lever arm and improve force distribution while keeping fixed supports. Use only critical members forming fully triangulated shapes (two triangles sharing a base) with smaller cross sections, limiting mass under 30. Prioritize tension/compression to remain lower than limits ±(0.5 × weight).",\n  "proposal": "Redesign 4-node closed truss with: \\n- Keep nodes_1 and 2 fixed at base.\\n- Keep node_3 fixed horizontally at x=2.0, y=0 but consider spacing vertically slightly to justify location under load.\\n- Raise node_4 vertically to ~3.5 m to create better triangular geometry.\\nConnect members so: member_1: node_1-node_2, member_2: node_2-node_4, member_3: node_4-node_3, member_4: node_3-node_1, member_5: node_4-node_1; forming closed triangulated frame optimizing stress and mass. Area_ids chosen for modest strength but low mass.",\n  "reasoning": "Structural triangular shapes limit internal bending by transmitting forces axially. With node_4 at 3.5 high, load arm increases, spreading forces. Members using smaller cross-sections except the base member_1 to carry compression from supports. Node_3 kept on base line supports load directly. Triangulation prevents racking, increasing stiffness and even force distributions.
