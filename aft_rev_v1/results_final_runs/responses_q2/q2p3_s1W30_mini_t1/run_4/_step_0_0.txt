    "preamble": "Optimize a minimal-stress-to-weight closed 2D truss with three given nodes under specified loads and supports. The objective is to minimize max stress/total weight while ensuring a closed truss and adherence to constraints on stress-to-weight ratio and total mass.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given 3 collinear nodes (0,0), (2,0), (6,0) with a load at node_3 (2,0), and supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). The problem requires closing the structure, so at least one additional node is needed to form a triangle or polygon to avoid a simple beam. Constraints are tight on mass and stress-to-weight ratio. Areas are discrete choices from given set.",
    
    "analysis": "The load at node_3 is a diagonal force (-15 N at -30°) acting downward-right inclined, producing tension/compression in members linked to node_3. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) allow reaction forces to stabilize. The nodes are collinear, so to maintain a closed truss (forming a polygon), we must introduce at least one additional node off the x-axis. Triangulation improves stiffness and distributes forces better, limiting peak stresses. Member choices and cross-sectional areas must balance weight and stress. A simple triangular truss formed by adding one node above the baseline near node_3 will create effective load paths and reduce self-weight.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Introducing a node roughly equidistant between node_2 and node_3, elevated vertically around 3.5 to 4.0 units, forms a triangle with members node_1-node_3, node_3-newNode, node_2-newNode, and node_1-node_2 as baseline. This triangle will distribute forces more evenly. Larger cross-section for high force members (baseline edges) and smaller areas for less stressed members will minimize weight while controlling stress. Avoid redundant members to reduce weight.",
    
    "reasoning": "Add new node_4 at (4.0, 3.5) to form triangle with node_2 (6,0) and node_3 (2,0) forming a high triangle that transfers load effectively. Make members: node_1-node_3, node_1-node_2, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4. Assign larger areas to node_1-node_2 and node_2-node_4 as they handle reaction and load transfer, smaller to diagonals. This satisfies closed structure (triangle with baseline), load paths, and constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions:\n- Member lengths via Euclidean distance.\n- Uniform unit density so mass proportional to sum(length * area).\n- Stress proportional to internal axial force / area.\n\nEquilibrium at nodes with force balances in x and y.\nCalculate member forces resolving the load at node_3 (approximate using method of joints).\nSelect area IDs to keep max stress and mass within constraints.\nCheck mass = sum(length * area) <=30 and max(stress)/mass <=1.0.\nAreas picked from discrete set; scale areas up selectively.\n\nEquations:\n- Lengths: dist = sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)\n- Forces: Resolve with 2D equilibrium per node.\n\nDesign to keep stress < tensile limit by adjusting areas.",
