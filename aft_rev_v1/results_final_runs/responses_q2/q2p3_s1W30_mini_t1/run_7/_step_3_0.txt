  "preamble": "Optimize a 2D truss with given loads and supports by minimizing the max stress-to-weight ratio. Current design with 4 nodes, 4 members has ratio 0.2187 under all constraints.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Structure has 4 nodes forming a triangular with a base node_1-node_2 and mid node_3. Load on node_3 downward-left. Members connect node_1 to node_3 (area 5), node_1-node_4(1), node_3-node_4(1), node_4-node_2(1). Mass high mainly due to large area 5 member_1. Constraints stress/weight ≤1, total mass ≤30 are met.",
  
  "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-15, -30) transferred primarily via member_1 to support at node_1 (pinned) and via node_4 to node_2 (roller). Member_1 is highly stressed (-2.6582), holds 9.774 mass due to large area. Other members have negligible stress and small areas, so contribute little to strength and weight. Structure is a closed shape with nodes forming a triangle with base extended. History shows higher stress/weight when node_4 is higher. Current large cross-section on member_1 reduces stress but increases weight. Potential inefficiency in member sizing: oversized member_1 and undersized others. Possible to redistribute areas or reposition node_4 vertically (within constraints) to reduce loads on member_1. Node positions with fixed loads/supports unchangeable. Member connections form closed chain, no floating nodes.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 area 5 dominates mass and reduces stress on that member but limits further weight reduction. Other members could be resized upwards to share load, possibly reducing member_1 area. Node_4 vertical position 3.25 seems optimal from history (4.5 raised stress, 3.0 fails constraints). Maintaining node_4 ~3.25 for stability. Minor horizontal repositioning of node_3 or node_4 not allowed due to supports and constraints. Triangulation is good for stiffness. More members could be added only if they reduce stress-to-weight, but complexity may increase mass. Simpler solution: downsize member_1 area, increase members 2,3,4 area to balance stress, keeping total mass ≤30.",
  
  "proposal": "Modify member areas to reduce weight on member_1 and increase on others to share load. Keep node positions identical to current (all constrained). Proposed member areas: member_1 area 4 (down from 5), member_2 area 2 (up from 1), member_3 area 2 (up from 1), member_4 area 2 (up from 1). This should maintain strength while reducing stress-to-weight ratio by lowering mass and stress on member_1. No node movement as nodes with load/support fixed.",
  
  "reasoning": "Using load path and statics, reducing large cross-section member_1 slightly reduces mass, others taking more load with increased area reduces max stress concentration. This balances and reduces maximum stress-to-weight ratio. Triangulation is preserved, structure remains closed. Area IDs chosen from given discrete set as per instructions.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: member_1 (node_1-node_3): length sqrt((2-0)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 2.0. member_2 (node_1-node_4): length sqrt((3-0)^2 + (3.25-0)^2) ≈ 4.07. member_3 (node_4-node_3): length sqrt((3-2)^2 + (3.25-0)^2) ≈ 3.29. member_4 (node_4-node_2): length sqrt((6-3)^2 + (0-3.25)^2) ≈ 4.03. Calculate mass = sum length * area as per area factors. Adjusted areas: member_1 area 4.887 *4 length 2.0 mass 9.774→ new 7.774. member_2 area 0.782 *4.07 length mass approx 3.18. member_3 area 0.782 *3.29 length mass approx 2.57. member_4 area 0.782 *4.03 length mass approx 3.15. Total mass approx 16.68, below 30 limit. Max stress estimated reduced below previous 2.66 due to better area distribution. Stress-to-weight ratio estimated <0.2187 improved.",
  
  "calculation": "Total mass approx 16.68 < 30; max stress expected < previous 2.66; stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 2.66/16.68 = 0.1595 < current 0.2187 constraint 1.0 satisfied. Load paths balanced through members with increased common area 2 to reduce member_1 overload. Structure connected and closed, no floating nodes. Supports and loads respected without motion.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Check node immobility for node_1, node_2, node_3 respected. Node_4 position unchanged at (3.00, 3.25). Member connections verified closed loop. Areas discrete and valid, no duplicates or isolated members. Stress-to-weight ratio substantially improved and constraints met. Stop criterion not met yet—possible future optimizations limited given node constraints.",
