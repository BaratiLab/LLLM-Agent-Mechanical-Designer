    "preamble": "Optimize a closed truss with 3 initial nodes under specified loads/supports minimizing max stress-to-weight ratio <=1.0 and total mass <=30. Introduce minimal nodes and members for triangulation and load transfer efficiency.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes: node_1 (0,0, pinned), node_2 (6,0, roller), node_3 (2,0, roller with load (-15, -30)). Constraints require closed truss and reasonable mass with area IDs from given discrete set. Initial direct connections only form a line, not closed. Need at least one additional node to form a closed polygon for triangulation.",

    "analysis": "Load at node_3 is downward-left. Direct line members (1-3, 3-2, 1-2) form a triangle but node_3 lies colinear with node_1 and node_2, causing zero area and unstable truss. Without a vertical or off-line node, structure can't transfer load optimally or remain stable. Stress distribution will be poor and max stress high. Adding a node above node_3 to form an upward triangle improves load path and stiffness. Supports pinned and roller at ends restrain vertical/horizontal displacements properly.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Introduce node_4 above node_3 to form a stable triangular truss. Possible node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) chosen for symmetry and effective vertical load path. Members: (1-4), (4-3), (3-2), (2-1), (4-2), (4-1) form triangulated, closed polygon. Assign truss members carefully to minimize stress and mass. Use small area members in low-stress tension and larger only where compression dominates.",

    "reasoning": "Use a single new node_4 (2.0, 3.0) above node_3 to form triangular sub-framework for load transfer. Members: (1-4), (4-3), (3-2), (2-1), and diagonals (4-2) and (4-1) for full triangulation and stability. This closed shape decouples compression and tension paths, reduces bending, and adheres to mass restriction. The node stays directly above node_3 to best transfer vertical load, minimizing eccentricities. Use area_ids: small (1=0.195) on tension members, moderate (4=3.128) on compression members, balancing weight and strength.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members act as axial members only; load considered static; stresses proportional to force/area; mass proportional to length×area; density constant for all areas; direction conventions consistent.\nCalculations:\n- Member lengths from coordinates.\n- Forces via static equilibrium at nodes.\n- Assign areas based on force sign and magnitude.\n- Total mass = sum[length_i × area(area_id_i)] <= 30.\n- Stress-to-weight ratio = max(abs(force_i)/area_i) / total_mass <= 1.0.\n- Derived force in members calculated via node equilibrium equations in 2D.\n- Approximate forces: Vertical load transmitted through node_4, decomposed into triangle members.\n- Prioritize smaller areas on high-tension members, moderate on compressive members for buckling.\n\nNode_4 at (2.0, 3.0).\nMembers:\n- m1: node_1-node_2\n- m2: node_1-node_4\n- m3: node_4-node_3\n- m4: node_3-node_2\n- m5: node_4-node_2\n- m6: node_1-node_3\nUse area IDs {1,4,3} for balance.",
