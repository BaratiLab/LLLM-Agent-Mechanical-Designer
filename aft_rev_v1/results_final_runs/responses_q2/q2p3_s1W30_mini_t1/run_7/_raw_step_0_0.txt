Introduce minimal nodes and members for triangulation and load transfer efficiency.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes: node_1 (0,0, pinned), node_2 (6,0, roller), node_3 (2,0, roller with load (-15, -30)). Constraints require closed truss and reasonable mass with area IDs from given discrete set. Initial direct connections only form a line, not closed. Need at least one additional node to form a closed polygon for triangulation.",\n\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 is downward-left. Direct line members (1-3, 3-2, 1-2) form a triangle but node_3 lies colinear with node_1 and node_2, causing zero area and unstable truss. Without a vertical or off-line node, structure can\'t transfer load optimally or remain stable. Stress distribution will be poor and max stress high. Adding a node above node_3 to form an upward triangle improves load path and stiffness. Supports pinned and roller at ends restrain vertical/horizontal displacements properly.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Introduce node_4 above node_3 to form a stable triangular truss. Possible node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) chosen for symmetry and effective vertical load path. Members: (1-4), (4-3), (3-2), (2-1), (4-2), (4-1) form triangulated, closed polygon. Assign truss members carefully to minimize stress and mass. Use small area members in low-stress tension and larger only where compression dominates.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Use a single new node_4 (2.0, 3.0) above node_3 to form triangular sub-framework for load transfer. Members: (1-4), (4-3), (3-2), (2-1), and diagonals (4-2) and (4-1) for full triangulation and stability. This closed shape decouples compression and tension paths, reduces bending, and adheres to mass restriction. The node stays directly above node_3 to best transfer vertical load, minimizing eccentricities.
