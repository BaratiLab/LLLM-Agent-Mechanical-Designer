  "preamble": "The current truss structure meets all constraints at iteration 3 with a stress-to-weight ratio of 0.2621. The objective is to minimize this ratio further while respecting constraints on stress, weight, and node/support positions.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "The structure is a 4-node, closed truss loaded at node_3 with supports at nodes 1, 2, and 3. Member cross-sections vary from 2 to 4 in area_id. Constraints include max stress-to-weight ratio <=1.0 and total mass <=30. Current best historic design has ratio 0.2187 with lighter members but similar topology.",
  "analysis": "Current load (-15,-30) is applied at node_3 which is roller supported, potentially causing significant axial forces in members connecting node_3. Node_4 is elevated (3.25) forming triangulated shape for stability. The largest stress magnitude is in member_1 connecting node_1 to node_3 which carries compressive stress -4.15. Members 2,3,4 have negligible or zero stress, indicating possible over-design. Current mass is 15.83, well below constraint of 30. The historic best design uses smaller cross sections on members 2,3,4 (area_id '1') with reduced mass 12.162 and improved stress-to-weight ratio 0.2187. Member_1 area is increased to '5' in that best design. The design history shows that reducing cross section in lightly stressed members while increasing area in critical members reduces ratio. Node positions are not changed between designs except for member areas. Node positions are fixed due to loads/support constraints. No floating nodes. The structure is well triangulated and stable.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Current inefficiency is mainly oversizing of members 2,3,4 carrying near zero stress. Member_1 is highly stressed suggesting increased area is beneficial. The best design from history confirms this. Node repositioning is limited due to fixed loads/supports and no benefit expected from small height changes. The stress distribution is skewed into member_1, so cross-section optimization is key.",
  "proposal": "Adopt the best historic design ('rank_1') node positions and improve member sizing by increasing area_id on member_1 to '5', while reducing area_id in members 2,3,4 to '1' to reduce mass. Keep node positions fixed as in current design to maintain boundary conditions and load application. This reduces stress-to-weight ratio to 0.2187, total mass 12.162, well within constraints. No new members or nodes needed.",
  "reasoning": "Design principles: triangulation is maintained with current node layout; member_1 carries main load path from node_3 to fixed node_1, requires higher capacity (area_id '5'). Members 2,3,4 are lightly stressed braces that stabilize node_4, so smaller cross sections reduce weight without losing stability. No node relocation needed due to fixed support and load nodes. This design reduces total mass and maximizes efficiency. Stress-to-weight ratio improves by ~17% compared to current design. Constraints on max stress-to-weight ratio and mass are satisfied.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elasticity, axial loading in members only, mass proportional to length × area_factor. Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance between node coordinates. Calculate mass as sum(length × area_factor). Calculate stress assuming member force proportional to load transfer and member area. Cross section areas mapped from area_id to factor: '1':0.195, '5':4.887. Use historic FEM results as validation for ratio and max stress estimation. Validate closed connected truss with current nodes.",
  "calculation": "Node positions unchanged: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (3,3.25). Member lengths: m1 (n1-n3) = 2.00, m2 (n1-n4) ≈ 3.61, m3 (n4-n3) ≈ 3.25, m4 (n4-n2) ≈ 3.61. Member masses: m1 = 2 * 4.887 = 9.774, m2 = 3.61 * 0.195 = 0.703, m3 = 3.25 * 0.195 = 0.634, m4 = 3.61 * 0.195 = 0.703. Total mass ≈ 11.814, less than 30 constraint. Assuming member_1 stress max = 2.66 (from historic data), stress-to-weight ratio = 2.66/11.814 ≈ 0.225 < 1. Constraint met. Members 2,3,4 near zero stress by history, so area reduction is safe. Design improvements validated.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Design meets all constraints, stress-to-weight ratio minimized to 0.2187 from historical best. Total mass is low and stress is valid. Node positions fixed due to load/support constraints, and triangulation is maintained. Member sizing optimized for weight reduction and stress capability. Structure is closed and stable. Ready to finalize.",
