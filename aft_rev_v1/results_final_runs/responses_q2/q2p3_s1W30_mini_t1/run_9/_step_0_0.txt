    "preamble": "Design a closed 2D truss with 3 given nodes and one applied load at node_3, fixed supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Objective: minimize stress-to-weight ratio under given constraints—max stress-to-weight ≤1 and mass ≤30, using available discrete area sizes. The structure must be fully connected and stable.",

    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes at (0,0), (6,0), and (2,0) are colinear, which is unstable for a typical truss without vertical bracing. Load at node_3 is horizontal and vertical downward (-15 N, -30 N). Supports at node_1 (pinned, full restrain) and node_2 (roller, vertical restrain). The initial structure is a line, which cannot resist vertical loads effectively or form a closed shape.",

    "analysis": "To resist the vertical and horizontal loads on node_3 and ensure stability, the truss requires triangulation with nodes not lying on a straight line. The original nodes are colinear, so adding at least one new node off the line is necessary to create triangular members. Since node_3 carries load, connecting it via diagonal members to the supports can distribute forces effectively. Optimal stress-to-weight ratio favors short members with adequate cross-sectional area. Member choices depend on length and area to balance mass and strength. Supports provide reactions at node_1 (both x and y fixed) and node_2 (vertical only). Load path likely: node_3 load resolved into compression/tension in diagonal members to supports, with horizontal bottom chord providing tie.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "A simple and stiff truss can be a triangle: nodes_1 and 2 fixed at base, add a new node above node_3 forming a triangle with them. This introduces diagonal members from the apex node to nodes 1 and 2 and a vertical member from node_3 to this apex node. Members' lengths will be short to minimize mass. This configuration stabilizes vertical loads and provides load paths. From this, we can size areas based on estimated forces from statics, aiming for minimal mass with adequate strength.",

    "reasoning": "Add a new node above node_3 around x=2.0, y≈3.0 (a reasonable height for triangulation and load transfer). Connect node_3 vertically up to the new node, and the new node diagonally to nodes_1 and 2 to form two triangles sharing a vertical member. Also keep the bottom chord connections (node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2) to maintain closure. The resulting structure is a trapezoidal frame with a vertical web. Assume tensions and compressions distribute load efficiently in these members. Theoretically, the apex node acts as a strut transfer point. This improves stability, load transfer, and satisfies closure.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members behave as axial bars in tension/compression; loads distribute via static equilibrium. Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance. Forces found by equilibrium of node_3 in horizontal and vertical directions. Use member cross-sectional area values from the given discrete set to minimize stress while reducing overall mass. Total mass = sum(length_i * area_id_i). Stress in each member = Force / area. Estimate forces: treat bottom chord as horizontal ties, diagonals carry vertical load components, vertical member carries vertical load. Calculate forces from force balance at node_3, then reactions at supports. Check stress-to-weight ratio = max(stress) / total_mass <=1. Adjust areas accordingly.",

    "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1=(0.0,0.0), node_2=(6.0,0.0), node_3=(2.0,0.0), node_4=(2.0,3.0) (new node). Member lengths: m1 (1-3): 2m, m2 (3-2): 4m, m3 (3-4): 3m, m4 (4-1): sqrt((2-0)^2+3^2)=3.6056m, m5 (4-2): sqrt((6-2)^2+3^2)=5.0m. Apply force equilibrium at node_3: load Fx=-15N, Fy=-30N. Members at node_3: m1(left horizontal), m2(right horizontal), m3(vertical up). Set tension positive away from node. Let forces in members: F_m1, F_m2, F_m3. Equilibrium: Horizontal: -15 + F_m1 - F_m2 = 0; Vertical: -30 + F_m3=0 => F_m3=30N (compression). We assume bottom chords in tension: F_m1 and F_m2 positive tension. Horizontal equilibrium: F_m1 - F_m2=15. From symmetry and load, select F_m1=22.5N, F_m2=7.5N to balance reactions. At node_4: members m3, m4, m5 must be in equilibrium. With F_m3=30N compression down to node_3, vertical, forces in m4 and m5 must balance horizontal components. Let F_m4 and F_m5 be forces in members 4-1 and 4-2. Angles: θ4 = atan(3/2)=56.31°, cos(θ4)=0.5547, sin(θ4)=0.8321; θ5 = atan(3/4)=36.87°, cos(θ5)=0.8, sin(θ5)=0.6. Horizontal equilibrium at node_4: F_m4*cos(θ4) + F_m5*cos(θ5) = F_m3 = 30N; Vertical equilibrium: F_m4*sin(θ4) = F_m5*sin(θ5). From vertical: F_m4*0.8321=F_m5*0.6 => F_m5=1.3868*F_m4. Substitute into horizontal: F_m4*0.5547 + (1.3868*F_m4)*0.8=30; F_m4*(0.5547 +1.1095)=30; F_m4*1.6642=30 -> F_m4=18.03N, F_m5=25.0N. Estimate members stresses by force/area, select areas accordingly: To keep stress-to-weight ≤1 and mass ≤30, choose area_id=3 (1.759) for high force members (m3, m5), area_id=2 (0.782) for medium force (m4), area_id=1 (0.195) for low force (m1,m2). Calculate mass: mass=length*area sum; 2*0.195 + 4*0.195 + 3*1.759 + 3.6056*0.782 + 5*1.759 = 0.39 + 0.78 + 5.277 + 2.82 + 8.795=17.06 <=30; max stress=F/area=30/1.759=17.06 N/unit area approx, stress-to-weight=17.06/17.06=1.0 meets constraint.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "Final truss is a four-node structure with triangulation providing stability and load paths. All nodes connected, design meets mass and stress-to-weight ratio constraints. Members sized from given discrete areas to balance stress and weight. New node at (2.0,3.0) introduced to achieve closed, stiff triangulated geometry. No duplication, consistent with inputs and instructions.",
