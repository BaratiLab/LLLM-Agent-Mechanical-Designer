  "preamble": "Optimize a 2D truss based on 3 given nodes with specified loads and support conditions, minimizing the stress-to-weight ratio subject to stress and mass constraints by adding nodes and members for a stable closed truss.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes provided are node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Load is applied at node_3 with vector (-15, -30) N. Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 and node_3 rollers. Constraints require closed truss (all nodes interconnected), stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 1 and mass ≤ 30. Cross-sectional area options are discrete from area_id '0' to '10'.",
  
  "analysis": "The truss spans horizontally between nodes from 0 to 6m along x-axis, all at y=0, which is a degenerate line. Applying vertical and horizontal loads at node_3 (2,0) with no vertical support at that node means without raising node(s) in y-direction the truss cannot resist lateral loads effectively. Also, having node_2 as roller means it can only resist vertical reactions. The structure as is is unstable against lateral loads. At least one node must be raised off the baseline to form a stable triangulated closed truss for load transfer. A triangle with nodes at (0,0), (6,0), and a node above the baseline at about (3, 3~4) meters would form a stable triangle. The load at node_3 can be transferred via diagonal members to supports. Including the existing node_3 (2,0) as a bottom chord point and introducing a top node near centerline will increase stability and allow load path triangulation. The closed structure can be formed with members connecting bottom and top nodes plus bottom chord members.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Key insight is that the original nodes are colinear; this is undesirable for a closed truss. Adding a top node for triangulation will help. The load direction suggests needing members to resist combined axial forces from horizontal and vertical components. Using lighter cross-sections in longer members and heavier in shorter, high-force members can optimize weight and stress. Keep the top node near the horizontal load to better transfer forces and minimize stress peaks.",
  
  "reasoning": "Introduce a new node_4 at (3.00, 3.00) forming a triangulated structure with original nodes 1, 2, 3. Construct members connecting node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2 for bottom chord, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2 and node_3-node_4 as diagonals forming a closed triangle with internal bracing. Assign cross sectional areas based on member loading: top chord and diagonals designed with moderate areas ('4' or '5') for strength; bottom chord potentially thinner except for segment with load. Using triangulation minimizes bending, maintains axial load transfer. This is a classical stable triangular truss design with added node for stability.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Material density constant, mass proportional to member length × area; stress proportional to axial force / area. Calculate member lengths using Pythagoras. Force equilibrium: horizontal and vertical forces balanced at nodes using method of joints. Calculate axial forces in members under applied load force (-15, -30) at node_3. Use geometry to get member angles. Estimate member forces, then assign area to keep max stress/weight ratio ≤1 and total mass ≤30. Calculate mass = ∑ length * area from provided area table.",
