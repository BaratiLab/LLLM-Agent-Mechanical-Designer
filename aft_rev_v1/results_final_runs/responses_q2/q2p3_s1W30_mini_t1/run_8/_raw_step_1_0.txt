Nodes with loads/supports fixed in position.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress-to-weight ratio = 0.8686 is below 1, total mass = 16.8899 < 30, so all constraints currently met. Loads apply -15N x, -30N y at node_3. Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 and node_3 (rollers). Members mostly size 2 or 3 area. Node_4 elevated, forming triangular top. Structure is closed, all nodes connected. History shows no better design found so far.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 acts downward and left. Support at node_1 (pinned) reacts in x,y, node_2 and node_3 (rollers) react vertically. Member_1 and member_2 connect nodes on the baseline with smaller area (2). Members to node_4 mostly area 2 and 3 with large member_5 (area 3). The highest compressive stress (-14.67) is in member_1 (node_1-node_3), suggesting it is a critical load path. The mass is moderate at 16.9, well below max 30, indicating potential to reduce cross-section areas to lower weight while keeping stress acceptable or reconfigure geometry to lower forces. Triangular top (nodes 1-4-2) creates good triangulation but member_5 (node_3-node_4) area is relatively large (3) and stressed mildly (1.36). Moving node_4 might reduce forces in some members. Node_3 on baseline at x=2 limits geometry. Supports at node_3 require it fixed; hence node_3 position not movable. Members area IDs must be chosen from given discrete set. Current structure likely close to minimal but not guaranteed optimal since member_1 has high absolute stress and mass is unevenly distributed.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Current stress heavily concentrated in member_1, a baseline horizontal member, likely in compression. Possibly member_1 area can be increased or load path adjusted by moving node_4 position sideways front or back. Node_4 vertical position can be adjusted within reason to optimize force distribution. Member_5 may be oversized or positioned suboptimally. Area assignment of members can be further optimized by lowering areas of lightly stressed members (like member_2) and increasing critical members. Member lengths correlates with mass. Maintaining closed topology with 4 nodes and triangular arrangements is efficient. Further node position fine-tuning within fixed supports and loads can improve force paths and mass.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Fine-tune node_4 position slightly, relocate horizontally closer to node_3 to reduce compressive load in member_1 and improve load transfer to node_4. Reassign member areas: increase critical member_1 area from \'2\' to \'3\' (0.782 to 1.759) to reduce stress, decrease low-stress members (like member_2) to \'1\' to save mass. Keep other area assignments similar, except reduce member_5 from \'3\' to \'2\' if possible to save weight without exceeding stress limit. Maintain current fixed positions of nodes 1,2,3 due to supports and loads. This approach balances stress and weight to lower ratio below 0.8686.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing area of member_1 lowers stress by increasing cross-section, reducing max stress absolute value and stress-to-weight ratio, though it raises mass slightly. Reducing areas on lightly stressed members and slightly repositioning node_4 closer horizontally to node_3 redistributes forces from heavily loaded member_1 to node_4 sufficiently. Since node_3 position is fixed (roller and load), node_4 horizontal movement towards node_3 shortens member_1 length, decreasing compressive force demand on it. Triangular topology is retained for stability and efficient load path.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic, axial loading only. Member length calculated from node coordinates. Mass for each member = length * area constant (from lookup). Stress proportional to force/area. To calculate new mass: sum(length * area). New stress approx. force / area, and max stress reduced by increasing area on critical member. Check stress-to-weight ratio = max stress / total mass <= 1.0. Fine-tune node_4 x from 3.0 closer to 2.5-2.7 to reduce length of member_1. Keep node_4 y same at 3.0 (geometrical stability). Reassign area ids carefully and verify masses and stresses based on expected load distributions.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Coordinates: node_1 (0.00,0.00), node_2 (6.00,0.00), node_3 (2.00,0.00) fixed; move node_4 to (2.70, 3.00).

Total mass = 3.518+0.78+3.17+3.33+2.4=13.2 < previous 16.8899 and well below 30. New max stress estimated less than previous due to increased area and geometry change, stress-to-weight ratio ~6.52/13.2=0.494 <0.8686 and <1.
