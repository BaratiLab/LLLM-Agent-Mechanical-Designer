Supports constrain node_1 pinned and node_2, node_3 rollers. Objective is closed structure - all nodes connected with triangulation or additional nodes for stability.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 is (-15,-30) indicating tension mostly downward and left. With node_1 pinned and node_2, node_3 rollers, reaction forces primarily develop at node_1 and node_2. Current nodes are colinear (all y=0 except node_3 at 0?), to create closure and good triangulation, adding nodes above base to form triangles is necessary for stiffness and to reduce bending forces in members. Members directly connecting node_1-node_2-node_3 are not sufficient for closure and stability. Failure modes likely in bending or overstress in direct base members. Optimal truss is likely a triangle or triangles with members in tension/compression, well distributed forces, and minimal mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Need to add nodes above the baseline to create triangular structures for closed loop. Consider midpoint above baseline or at calculated heights for optimal load transfer. Avoid large cross-sections to reduce mass but ensure members are strong enough to take tension/compression. Using only given area IDs. Smaller members in compression, larger in tension as per needed. Consider symmetry where possible to keep stresses balanced.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Add one or two new nodes above the line between nodes 1 and 2 (and 3) to form two triangles sharing a top node, forming a closed polygon. This will distribute load from node_3 better through triangulation. Place new node(s) near the midpoint of node_1 and node_2 at a height h calculated based on load direction and geometry to balance forces. Use smaller area IDs for shortest members and larger for longer/higher load members. Use members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, plus baseline members node_1-node_2, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_1 for closed loop. This ensures structure is fully connected and closed.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assume equilibrium: sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0 at nodes. Calculate length of members and pick area_id from given discrete set to minimize total weight. Mass = sum(length * area).
