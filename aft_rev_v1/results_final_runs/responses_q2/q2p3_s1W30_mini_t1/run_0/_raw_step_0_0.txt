The system initially aligned on x-axis is under lateral load. Need closed truss (forming a polygon with connected members). Current nodes colinear, so must add nodes or members for closure and stability.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Original nodes colinear (all y=0), no stable 2D truss; takes only axial load in members along x-axis resulting in instability under vertical/horizontal combined load at node_3. Load at node_3 has vertical and horizontal components: Fx = -15*cos(30°) ≈ -12.99 N, Fy = -15*sin(30°) ≈ -7.5 N downward. Supports: node_1 pinned (fix all displacement), node_2 roller (fix vertical displacement), node_3 roller (one direction). Need to add nodes above or below x-axis to form triangles for stability and load path. Closed truss with 3 nodes is impossible, so add at least one node to create a triangle. Ideal is a triangular configuration for minimal weight and stable load path. Members need to carry axial forces with minimal bending. Maximum stress expected in members connected to loaded node and supports.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a fourth node above node_3 (e.g., node_4 at (2.0,2.0)) forms two triangles sharing a common node_3. This creates a stable triangular truss. Members: (node_1-node_3), (node_2-node_3), (node_1-node_4), (node_2-node_4), (node_3-node_4). This 5-member closed polygon transfers load effectively. Choose areas based on member forces, longer members need larger area to reduce stress. Load path: load at node_3 transfers axial forces diagonally to supports through node_4 and horizontal members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Use triangulation: add node_4 at (2.0, 2.0) to form triangular closed truss. This node is exactly above load node_3 at height 2.0 for effective vertical load support, minimal increase in member length (2m vertical). Members arranged to create balanced axial load distribution. Node positions kept simple for easy calculations. Member areas selected conservatively from given options to ensure stress-to-weight ratio ≤1.0 and total weight <30.
