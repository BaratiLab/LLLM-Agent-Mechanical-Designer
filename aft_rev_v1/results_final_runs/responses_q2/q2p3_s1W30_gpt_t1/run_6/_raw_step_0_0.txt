The connected structure must minimize the stress-to-weight ratio (no more than 1.0), be fully connected, and stay under a strict mass constraint. Only the supplied nodes, supports, loads, and discrete area options are allowed. Generation of one new node is permitted to create an efficient, triangulated layout.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Three base nodes (0,0), (6,0), and (2,0) are almost colinear, all at y=0, limiting natural triangulation and creating risk of poor force transfer and excessive stress. A large, off-angle load at node_3 (-15.0, -30.0) produces high vertical and horizontal reactions. All nodes are supported (pinned/roller), but triangulation is needed to achieve an efficient, closed structure.",\n    \n    "analysis": "With the given node positions, direct member connections (\'node_1\'-\'node_2\', \'node_1\'-\'node_3\', \'node_2\'-\'node_3\') form a degenerate triangle along the x-axis, providing minimal depth and resistance against vertical loads. The strong downward load at node_3 risks very high stresses in the horizontal members, as the structure acts more as a beam than as a truss. To lower stress-to-weight, the force path must be triangulated with a vertical or inclined member, requiring the generation of a new, elevated node.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "A fourth node above the x-axis (e.g., at (3.0, 2.5)) introduces much-needed depth, creating effective diagonals. Triangulation ensures that load transfer is efficient and member lengths stay reasonable. By distributing forces through at least two inclined members to node_3, peak stresses are reduced. A compact arrangement minimizes total member length and mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Adding a node centrally and above (e.g., (3.0, 2.5)) preserves geometric coherence with existing nodes and enables full triangulation. Connect all nodes so that every node is at least in two triangles. Members from supports to the new node, and from the new node to node_3, provide alternate load paths, while short-circuiting excessive force flows in the base. To minimize weight, the areas are carefully selected for each member based on anticipated forces (higher in load-path diagonals, lower elsewhere), keeping total mass under 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume all truss members are pinned at both ends. Use sum of moments and equilibrium equations to estimate member axial forces: base members act in tension/compression due to horizontal load; inclined members bear vertical portion. Estimate key diagonal force F = |load|/sqrt(2) ≈ 33.54 kN; area = force/allowable_stress (ratio capped at 1.0). For mass: sum(lengths × area) using chosen area_id values. Assign high area to highly stressed diagonals, low to lightly loaded members. Check that mass < 30.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Define nodes: node_1 (0.0, 0.0), node_2 (6.0, 0.0), node_3 (2.0, 0.0), node_4 (3.0, 2.5). Member set: node_1-node_2 (base), node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3 (short), node_1-node_4 (left diagonal), node_2-node_4 (right diagonal), node_3-node_4 (load-bearing diagonal). Member lengths are ~6.0, 2.0, 4.0, ~3.90, ~3.90, 2.92. Assign area_ids: diagonals 5 or 6, short base members 1. Compute: total_mass = (6.0×0.195) + (2.0×0.195) + (4.0×0.195) + (3.90×7.037) + (3.90×7.037) + (2.92×7.037) ≈ 1.17+0.39+0.78+27.44+27.44+20.55 = 77.77.  This exceeds mass limit; reduce area_id for diagonals to 3 (1.759). New total_mass: (12.0×0.195)+(10.72×1.759)=2.34+18.87=21.21 (< 30). Now check stress: maximum member force (from load) is ~33.54 (from diagonal), area = 1.759, so stress=33.54/1.759=19.07, total weight=21.21, ratio=19.07/21.21=0.9<1.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Structure is a closed, fully triangulated truss using a new elevated node for load path triangulation.
