The prior iteration was over-stressed (stress-to-weight: 1.76 > 1.0) but had acceptable mass (~20.8 < 30). The goal is to redesign or optimize the structure so that its stress-to-weight ratio is ≤ 1.0 and all nodes remain connected and satisfy given boundary conditions.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs indicate the structure is overstressed at a member (member_2 at -36.56), with feasible mass. The most critical constraint violation is stress-to-weight, meaning some members are too slender/poorly oriented to resist applied forces.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Examining the current and historical structure, the main vertical/horizontal triangle is present (nodes 1-2-3), and a fourth (node_4) gives some diagonals for triangulation. The primary issue is localized overstress at member_2, likely from a bad angle/load transfer, which can be improved by redistributing geometry and member sizing. Current member areas show most are thin (area_id \'1\'), with diagonals as \'3\' (still not enough for high stress in member_2). Given load at node_3 (-15.0, -30.0 N), most stress is driven to node_3 and members connecting it.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Member_2 connects node_1 and node_3 directly across a large distance, acting as a critical bottom chord. Increasing its section or reducing its force via geometry or bracing could control stress. Notably, current node_4 is centered at x=3.0—moving it or adding a fifth node may relieve stress. All nodes except node_4 must remain fixed for boundary conditions. Prioritize efficient triangles and direct load paths.",\n    \n    "proposal": "To minimize max stress and improve force distribution, I\'ll (1) add a fifth node above node_3 (to convert triangles and shorten critical spans), (2) thicken and strategically thin members as needed, (3) adjust node_4 higher and leftward for a steeper, more efficient diagonal. Retain all specified supports/loads. Remove/redirect members redundant under new triangulation. Use larger sections for highly-stressed members (e.g., area_id \'4\'), and reduce others where possible. Ensure all members participate. Mass should stay well below the 30-unit limit for design freedom.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Optimal 2D truss uses direct triangles, putting loaded nodes (node_3) near more diagonal supports and distributing the vertical load along multiple braced paths. Adding node_5 at (2.0, 2.0) above node_3 creates steeper triangles and removes direct, overstressed spans. Slightly lifting/moving node_4 helps redistribute diagonal/bending. Heavier areas for bottom chords and key diagonals; lighter for verticals/low-stress. Use load path reasoning to assign area ids.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Steel, small deformations. Estimate member forces via statics; main load (-15,-30) is downward/rightward. Key equations: member force = projection of external load; mass = sum(length × area). Adjust area_id to ensure stress/mass balance. Member_2 previously failed at -36.56 N; need area ≈ abs(force)/allowable_stress. Try area_id \'4\' (~3.13) for highly loaded, and \'1\' or \'2\' for lightly loaded. Add members node_3-node_5, node_4-node_5, node_1-node_5, node_2-node_5 for closure and redundancy. Remove any weak/redundant members.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Move node_4: from (3.0,2.5) to (2.8,3.2): steeper diagonal, shorter span for lower stress. Add node_5: at (2.0,2.0), right above node_3. Connect with existing nodes to make triangles: node_1-node_5, node_2-node_5, node_3-node_5, node_4-node_5. Main bottom chord member_2 now split/shared; assign area_id \'4\'. Diagonals next: area_id \'2\'. Verticals/short connectors: area_id \'1\'. Mass: all members <30, most likely ~22. Estimate: max member force with new geometry ~18 N, area 3.13 ample, gives σ~5.8 << max allowable (so stress-to-weight ≤ 1.0).",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "No load/support nodes moved.
