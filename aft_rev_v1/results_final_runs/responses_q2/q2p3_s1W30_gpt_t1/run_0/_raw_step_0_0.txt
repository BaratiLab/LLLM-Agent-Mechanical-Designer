Objective: minimize maximum member stress-to-weight ratio without exceeding mass or stress limits. All members and nodes must form a structurally efficient, triangulated, fully connected configuration.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes on x-axis: (0,0), (2,0), (6,0). Loads act at node_3 (middle, vertical and horizontal), supports at all nodes. Key design: triangulate, minimize mass, evenly distribute load paths. Closed truss means all nodes interconnected.",\n    \n    "analysis": "node_3 is not at the centroid, resulting in asymmetric force paths. node_1 is pinned (fixes x/y), node_2 and node_3 are rollers (restrict translation in one axis), so horizontal stability is ensured by node_1. Applied force at node_3 is angled, favoring direct diagonal members to anchors. To avoid heavy vertical members (inefficient under combined loading), triangulation is ideal. Adding a high node above x-axis at a centroidal position will triangulate efficiently and support load transfer, enhancing stiffness and minimizing max stress.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Diagonals from loaded node to supports are shortest direct paths for efficient stress transfer. Triangulated shapes resist deformation, lower member forces, and allow use of minimal areas and low mass. Plan: add a node_4 above line at geometric centroid, connect all nodes, total 6 members (triangle-based quadrilateral).",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Introduce node_4 at (3.0, 2.0) above the x-axisâ€”centered between node_1 and node_2, slightly above for efficient height/area tradeoff. Members: connect every node to node_4, plus all original nodes to form two triangles. This reduces the longest member lengths, spreading forces across multiple elements, and maximizes stiffness/minimizes mass. Minimal area (ID \'1\' or \'2\') suffices, as efficient force paths reduce stress.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume all members made of area_id=\'2\' (area=0.782).
