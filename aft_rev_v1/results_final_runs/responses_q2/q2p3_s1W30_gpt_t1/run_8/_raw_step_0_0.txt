The goal is to connect the nodes in a closed, statically determinate (triangulated) truss, while minimizing the stress-to-weight ratio and total mass, and thus ensuring both constraint satisfaction and structural efficiency.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Input nodes form a horizontal chain (0,0), (6,0), (2,0). Supports: pinned at left, roller at center and right. Load is applied at center node. Node positions are colinear, which is suboptimal for triangulation, so I can introduce one new node for bracing.",\n\n    "analysis": "The existing node arrangement is unstable for resisting vertical/horizontal loads via truss action since they\'re colinear. Introducing a fourth node (above node_3) allows a stable, triangulated truss with direct load paths. By connecting all nodes in a triangle (fan pattern), I can control member forces and minimize maximum stress by keeping members short and load paths direct. The structure should be light but must not exceed stress-to-weight constraints.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Colinear nodes need to be braced for stability. Raising a node above the base (at, say, (2,2)) at node_3 allows all nodes to be connected in triangles. All constraints must be checked: mass (<=30) and stress-to-weight ratio (<=1.0). Using small area-ids minimizes mass, but may increase member stress. Distributing load over more members is desirable.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Introducing node_4 at (2.0, 2.0) effectively triangulates the structure: forms two triangles sharing the diagonal node. Connecting all base nodes and the new node (roof) ensures a closed, singly connected structure, distributing applied load over multiple members. Members: base (1-2), left (1-3), diagonal (1-4), vertical (3-4), diagonal (2-4), right (2-3). Area IDs are chosen as small as feasible (area_id \'1\') for weight, but increased (area_id \'2\') for diagonals that see highest loads, improving stress distribution. Assumed material area scaling factors are as provided.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Key assumptions: Members see only axial force; structure is statically determined; node_4 placed above node_3 for effective triangulation; area_id mapping strictly per input. For member forces: establish geometry, calculate lengths, resolve applied loads into truss joints, estimate max force per member. Compute member lengths and areas for mass, and for each member, estimate stress (|F|/A). Stress-to-weight ratio: (max(abs(stress)) / total_weight); ensure <=1.0. Check total mass (sum of length × area).",\n\n    "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1=(0.00,0.00), node_2=(6.00,0.00), node_3=(2.00,0.00), node_4=(2.00,2.00).
