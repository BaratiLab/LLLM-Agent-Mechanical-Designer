    "preamble": "This problem seeks to optimize a 2D truss under prescribed loads, supports, and area options so that it is fully connected, lightweight, and achieves a maximum stress-to-weight ratio <= 1.0 (the most restrictive constraint), while also keeping total mass <= 30. The current structure and all historic structures violate the main ratio constraint, mainly due to high local/max stress in some key members. Objective: Generate a structurally efficient (closed) truss connecting all nodes, minimizing member areas while meeting these constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "The current structure is an internally braced truss with multiple nodes and lightest possible areas for non-critical members. However, members 'member_1' and 'member_2' still far exceed allowed stress-to-weight ratio (~2.15, where max allowed is 1.0). Previous attempts with larger or more members/more area just increased mass, not feasibility. Only 'node_1', 'node_2', 'node_3' have supports/loads, which must stay fixed. 'node_3' sees a large load (-15.0, -30.0), so surrounding triangulation and pathing to supports is critical.",
    
    "analysis": "Current design fails mainly at 'member_1' (node_1 to node_3), bearing almost all the -15,-30 load directly (stress = -16.42). Triangulated upper nodes ('node_4', 'node_5', 'node_6') help, but limited by small member areas, and their layout isn't optimally transferring loads. Prior structures show that simply adding more members or increasing areas increases mass without resolving stress path issues. The key: create more direct, triangulated load paths between 'node_3' (loaded node) and both supports, spreading force over multiple members symmetrically, minimizing length, and selecting the lowest area that keeps stress-to-weight ratio <= 1.0. Direct force lines from 'node_3' to 'node_1', 'node_2', and an optimized apex will most efficiently distribute vertical/horizontal components. A simple efficient solution is a compact Pratt/Warren-style truss with an apex.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "All designs that lack vertical transfer via an apex or do not strongly triangulate force vectors from loaded node ('node_3') to supports fail ratio constraints, even if total mass is low. Simple triangulated trusses should be favored over wider/complex layouts, to both spread and shorten load paths. Chosen member areas must be judicious: upsizing only the over-stressed members, keeping others to minimum legal area. The apex node's y-coordinate should be maximized—direct line from 'node_3' vertically upwards to a central node, then path to each support.",
    
    "proposal": "Redesign the truss into a minimal, highly efficient three-bay triangle (Pratt/Warren hybrid): fix supports and load nodes in x as required, add a single apex node at (x_apex, y_apex) above 'node_3' to distribute vertical load. Members from load node to each support plus to the apex, and from apex to supports, forming strong triangles. Use smallest area in non-critical members, upsize only those directly carrying largest load. This should dramatically reduce stress in any one member (esp. former 'member_1').",
    
    "reasoning": "By placing an apex above 'node_3' at (2.0, y) and creating two triangles meeting at that top node, the vertical component of the large load on 'node_3' is split via force resolution across two symmetric members down to each support. This reduces single-member overload, maximizes load sharing, minimizes path lengths and, if geometry is chosen clever, ensures all force components are transferred as efficiently as allowed by constraints. All connections must be direct (no isolated nodes), use minimum area where possible. The optimal y_apex is chosen so that stress in each slant member does not exceed (total_weight × 1.0). For demonstration, start with y=2.5 (apex biased upwards relative to earlier solutions).",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Let the main nodes be: node_1=[0.0,0.0], node_2=[6.0,0.0], node_3=[2.0,0.0], node_4=[2.0,2.5] (apex). Members: node_3 to apex, apex to each support, node_3 to each support (forming two lower chords), and a tie between supports if needed for closure. The load (-15, -30) will be split into reactions at supports and in slant members. Select areas: start with area '2' for diagonals from node_3 (largest expected stress assuming symmetry), area '1' elsewhere if possible. Estimate member forces by static equilibrium on node_3: Sum Fx = 0, Sum Fy = applied load. For simplicity, each slant member (from node_3 to apex) will bear part of vertical load. Analyze geometry: vector from node_3 to apex is (0,2.5) — vertical, so member from apex to each support is slant. Alternatively, having diagonals split from node_3 to both supports and apex creates three ways for force flow.",
    
    "calculation": "Total mass is: sum[member_length × area]. Stress = force / area. Static force balance at node_3: vertical load must be transferred upward toward apex, and split via slant members to left/right supports. By symmetry and a high enough apex, the member from node_3 to apex carries most of the vertical load, the two members from apex to supports resolve horizontal reaction components. Slip extra diagonals from node_3 to node_1 and node_3 to node_2 (direct). Let’s check lengths: node_3 to node_4 is 2.5 units. Member apex to node_1: sqrt[(2.0)^2 + (2.5)^2] = √(4+6.25)=√10.25≈3.20; apex to node_2: sqrt[(4)^2 + (2.5)^2]=√(16+6.25)=√22.25≈4.72. Node_3 to node_1: 2.0 units; to node_2: 4.0 units. Use area '2' (0.782) for main vertical and both slants, area '1' (0.195) for short closure at base node_1 to node_2.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Examine member force: Upward member (node_3 to apex) directly takes most vertical (load), others take part via geometry. Check that max |force|/total_mass ≤1.0 by selecting area for largest force (expected at vertical). For a load of -30kN (vertical), member of 2.5m at area 0.782 has mass = 1.955; its max stress at 38.4e3 N (for area 0.782e-2 m²), but total weight ≈ (sum of all member masses) < 7, so stress/weight < 1.0 if stress is under 7kN per member, or area can be increased further if necessary (but mass budget allows some increase). Confirm closure—every node is directly or indirectly connected. All area_id values are valid; no duplicates; no isolated nodes; supports/loads fixed.",
