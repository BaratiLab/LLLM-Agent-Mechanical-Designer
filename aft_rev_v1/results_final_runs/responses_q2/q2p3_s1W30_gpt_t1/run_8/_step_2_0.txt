    "preamble": "The structure is a 2D truss with three supported nodes and one loaded node. The objective is to design a closed truss that supports the specified loads, ensures all nodes are connected, and keeps max stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 1.0 and total mass ≤ 30. Previous designs violated at least one constraint—either over-massed or overstressed.",

    "scratch_pad_1": "Need to maintain all prescribed supports and loaded nodes at current coordinates. Current and previous designs used large area members and/or inefficient layouts (e.g., long heavy chords, non-optimal triangles) resulting in excessive mass or unsafe stress. The optimal answer likely needs to rethink member sizing and triangulation.",

    "analysis": "Current best design has too much mass (74.59 > 30) but low stress-to-weight ratio (~0.6), using large area_id '5' for most diagonals and chords. Previous lighter designs (total mass ~15.6) failed max stress/weight constraint due to under-sized area members, so members with area_id '1' alone are inadequate for primary load-bearing members. Node_3, the load point, sits between pinned node_1 and roller node_2, with a fourth node (node_4) above, forming a triangle. However, inefficient member areas are responsible for excess mass. Structural history shows direct-load paths (single panels) lead to overstress, while excessive area sizing leads to high mass. An optimal solution must minimize member area in lightly loaded members and only use larger areas in critical high-force members. Full triangulation will improve load spreading, and placing top chord node (node_4) slightly higher for a more favorable geometry can help.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: All constraints violated due to imbalance between member area assignments and connection geometry. Structure must be triangulated (ensuring stability and lower member force magnitudes) and must use minimum adequate area for each member. Increasing vertical offset for top joint helps reduce compressive force in the top member. The lightest constraint-satisfying truss is likely a Warren or Pratt configuration with minimum panelling.",

    "proposal": "Redesign the structure by repositioning the current fourth node to slightly increase the height for a better load path and improved force distribution. Maintain 4 nodes and assign area_id '2' or '3' to primary/critical members (lower/upper chords and key diagonals), and leave lightest allowable (area_id '1') for vertical and least loaded members. Close the truss with minimal, triangulated members for optimal efficiency.",

    "reasoning": "The given force is significantly inclined. A compact triangle with node_4 above the midpoint between nodes 1 and 2 is mechanically optimal (minimizing member length and maximizing height for compressive chord). Use the minimum area needed on diagonals and chords based on load path, and connect all nodes for structural closure. Avoid large areas for lightly loaded members. Triangulation ensures redistribution of local overstress and stability. Slightly increase top node (node_4) vertical coordinate from 3.2 to about 3.6-3.8 for more favorable internal force split.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Steel density uniform, all members pin-jointed. Calculate max expected axial force in horizontal and diagonal members under given load (magnitude and direction). Major load path is from node_3 diagonally to top node, then down to supports. Use area_id '2' (A=0.782) for diagonals, area_id '3' (A=1.759) for top and bottom chords. Short members or non-primary members get area_id '1' (A=0.195). For member mass: mass = length × area, total mass ≤ 30. For each member: estimate force from static equilibrium, check stress = force / area, ensure max(abs(stress))/total_mass ≤ 1.",

    "calculation": "Place node_4 at (3.0, 3.7) for symmetry and efficient triangulation. Connect as follows: node_1-node_3-node_2 bottom chord, node_1-node_4-node_2 top chord, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_2. For major load path, estimate max tension/compression in top and bottom chords (approx 15-20 kN), assign area_id '3'. Diagonals (node_1-to-node_3 and node_2-to-node_3) lower: if short, try area_id '1' or '2' based on axial force from statics. Estimate total length, sum mass. Ensure all connections close triangles; no node isolated.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "Verify: All nodes connected; no isolated nodes. All supports and loads unaltered. Area assignments justified. Likely mass ~27-29. Stress-to-weight ratio should satisfy constraint, as primary members receive slightly larger area. Node positions unique and precise (to 1e-2). Member connectivity closes all triangles (redundant for global stability).",
