    "preamble": "Three non-collinear nodes are given, with supports and a significant inclined load at node_3 (2.0, 0.0). Objective: develop a connected, closed, and mass-efficient 2D truss that minimizes the stress-to-weight ratio (max(abs(stress))/total_weight <= 1.0), with total mass <= 30. All design must use allowed discrete member areas and close the structural system. No prior solutions; starting from scratch.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes form a triangle: node_1 (0.0,0.0) pinned, node_2 (6.0,0.0) roller, node_3 (2.0,0.0) roller. Large skewed force at node_3 (-15,-30) needs direct load paths and closed triangulated system. Truss must be closed and connected; minimal member set is three bars but optimal force path may be enhanced by a strategically placed auxiliary node to enable better triangulation and lower max stress. Support conditions at all 3 nodes mean global stability is established; need internal stability.",
    
    "analysis": "If members are only (1-2), (2-3), (1-3), the triangle is closed but the acute angle at node_3 will cause high stress concentrations in the (1-3) and (2-3) members under the large load at node_3. Introducing one interior node above the base (between node_1 and node_2) allows extra triangulation, creating two smaller triangles and adding vertical force-carrying capability directly under the load. Proper location and connection to node_3 allows for improved force paths, reduced critical force, leveraging symmetry and efficient area assignment. Given mass constraint, only the necessary triangulation should be added.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Key concern: limiting max member stress while keeping weight low. Adding an interior node (node_4) at approx (3,2.2) vertically above node_3 enables a force path (node_3 to node_4) able to handle much of the vertical component, reducing demand on the base members. Areas should be distributed such that loaded members get a higher area. Need to divide base (node_1)-(node_2) into two (node_1)-(node_4)-(node_2), also connect node_4 to node_3 for vertical resolution. Closed truss: nodes 1,2,3,4, with members (1-3), (3-2), (2-4), (4-1), (3-4).",
    
    "reasoning": "Triangulation via node_4 provides two short compression/tension triangles, decreasing member length and improving buckling and stress characteristics. The base is split, reducing base span. The truss forms two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4), efficiently carrying inclined loads. The inclined nature of the applied force and all supports being along y=0 makes placing node_4 vertically above node_3 effective. Select minimum area for non-critical members; assign increased area to the directly loaded member (3-4). Total member area-weight must remain under 30 units and stress-to-mass under 1.0 ratio.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume load at node_3 splits along (node_3-node_4) (vertical) and horizontally along (node_3-node_1) and (node_3-node_2). For vertical efficiency, node_4 at (3,2.24) (vertical 1.5~2.2 units above node_3) balances geometry and length. Use trigonometry to estimate member forces. Assign area IDs: heaviest member (3-4): area_id '3' (1.759), base (1-4) and (4-2): area_id '1' (0.195), (1-3),(2-3): area_id '1' (0.195), (1-2): area_id '1' (0.195). Check all member lengths, sum total mass, estimate max force/stress (worst in (3-4)), check stress-to-weight.",
    
    "calculation": "Node_4 is placed at (3.0, 2.24). Member lengths: (1-3): sqrt((2-0)^2)=2.0; (2-3): sqrt((6-2)^2)=4.0; (3-4): sqrt((3-2)^2+(2.24-0)^2)=sqrt(1+5.02)=2.37; (1-4): sqrt((3-0)^2+(2.24-0)^2)=sqrt(9+5.02)=3.83; (4-2): sqrt((6-3)^2+(0-2.24)^2)=sqrt(9+5.02)=3.83; (1-2):6.0. Assign area_ids: (1-3) '1'; (2-3) '1'; (3-4) '3'; (1-4) '1'; (4-2) '1'; (1-2) '1'. Total mass: (2.0+4.0+2.37+3.83+3.83+6.0) = 22.03 units × area weight sum: (0.195×5 + 1.759) = 2.734. Weighted sum: (2*0.195)+(4*0.195)+(2.37*1.759)+(3.83*0.195)+(3.83*0.195)+(6*0.195) = 0.39+0.78+4.17+0.75+0.75+1.17=7.81, within 30. Estimate max force in (3-4): vertical load split: force in (3-4) ≈ sqrt((-15)^2+(-30)^2)=33.54. Stress = F/A = 33.54/1.759=19.07 (critical). Stress-to-weight: 19.07/7.81=2.44; constraint violated. Try next area_id for (3-4): area_id '4' (3.128), recalc: (2.37*3.128)=7.42. Mass: 0.39+0.78+7.42+0.75+0.75+1.17=11.26. Max stress=33.54/3.128=10.73, stress-to-weight=10.73/11.26=0.95, constraint satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Design uses 4 nodes, 6 members. All unique members, triangulated, force and mass checks meet constraints. Area_id chosen optimally; stress-to-weight 0.95<1.0, total mass 11.26<30. Structure is closed, every node participates. Members correctly sized for expected loads; auxiliary node placement explained and justified.",
