    "preamble": "This is a single-shot structural optimization for a closed 2D truss with three nodes, prescribed supports, and a load. The goal is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio, ensuring all constraints (stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 1.0, mass ≤ 30) are met using only approved cross-sectional area values. The optimal truss must connect all given nodes and may introduce new nodes if beneficial.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three nodes positioned horizontally, with a force on node_3, pinned support at node_1 (left), roller supports at node_2 (right) and node_3 (middle). All members must be unique and all nodes connected in a single closed truss. Triangulated geometry ensures minimum instability. Objective is to select member layout and area ids such that max(abs(stress))/total_weight ≤ 1.0 and mass ≤ 30.",
    
    "analysis": "node_3 bears a significant force pulling left-down (-15, -30). node_1 (0,0) is fully fixed, node_2 (6,0) and node_3 (2,0) are on rollers (vertical movement restricted). Only horizontal connections among given nodes yields an unstable geometry (all points collinear, no depth). Adding a fourth node above (for triangulation) introduces force transfer paths and helps resist vertical and horizontal components, closes the structure, and prevents mechanism formation. Key challenge: Transfer high vertical load at node_3 into supports while minimizing total member mass and max stress. Area assignment must be efficient, with larger areas for most stressed members and smaller for others.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangularization is necessary—the three nodes form a straight line, so the structure is unstable in-plane and will collapse. Introducing a fourth node (apex) above node_3, say node_4 at (3.0, 2.5), allows a stable triangle: node_1 - node_2 - node_4, with node_3 connected to node_4 for load transfer. Four nodes, five members make a closed, efficient truss. All connections are unique, and member count is minimized for closure.",
    
    "reasoning": "Optimal strategy: (1) Introduce node_4 at (3.0, 2.5) centered above node_3 for geometric symmetry and direct load transfer. (2) Connect: node_1 - node_4, node_2 - node_4, node_3 - node_4, node_1 - node_3, node_2 - node_3 for rigid closure. (3) Place largest area on members expected to transmit highest forces: node_3-node_4 and node_3-node_1. Use minimal area for redundant closure members. Calculations will verify areas comply with stress/mass constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All bars are axially loaded. Area_ids from 0–10 (precise float values). Steel or generic modulus, but only relative stress considered. Calculations: Member lengths via Euclidean, internal forces by static balance, stress = F/A, mass=sum(L×area). Forces estimated via Maxwell diagram or by symmetry for the roof truss under out-of-plane load. For ‘worst-case’ estimation, member joining node_3 to node_4 and node_1 will be critical for both vertical and horizontal force transfer. Assign largest area id where peak force is expected (node_3-node_4), moderate for node_1-node_3, smallest for least loaded closure bars. Satisfy mass budget by using small areas for others.",
    
    "calculation": "Step 1: Place node_4 at (3.0, 2.5).\nStep 2: Compute member lengths:\n - node_1-node_3: sqrt((2-0)^2+0^2)=2.00\n - node_2-node_3: sqrt((6-2)^2+0^2)=4.00\n - node_3-node_4: sqrt((3-2)^2+(2.5-0)^2)=sqrt(1+6.25)=2.69\n - node_1-node_4: sqrt((3-0)^2+2.5^2)=sqrt(9+6.25)=3.91\n - node_2-node_4: sqrt((6-3)^2+2.5^2)=sqrt(9+6.25)=3.91\n\nStep 3: Truss force analysis: Load at node_3 divides via node_3-node_4 and node_3-node_1, node_4 spreads force across top and down to supports. Estimated maximal member force for F = sqrt(15^2+30^2) = 33.54 kN on node_3-node_4 (worst-case assumption). Assign A=4 (area_id '4', 3.128) for node_3-node_4, A=2 (area_id '2', 0.782) for node_1-node_3, rest at minimal for closure (area_id '0', 1.0).\nTotal mass = 2.00*0.782 + 4.00*1.0 + 2.69*3.128 + 3.91*1.0 + 3.91*1.0 = 1.56+4.00+8.41+3.91+3.91=21.79 < 30.\n\nStep 4: stress = F/A = 33.54/3.128=10.73 for node_3-node_4 (max), stress-to-weight ratio = 10.73/21.79 = 0.49 < 1.0, constraints met.",
    "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met: All nodes connected in a closed triangulated truss, max stress is below what is permitted by stress-to-weight ratio, total mass comfortably below 30. Member areas are efficiently distributed, only one additional node, and all rules followed.",
