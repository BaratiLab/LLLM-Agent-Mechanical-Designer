    "preamble": "The challenge is to optimize a small 2D truss under an eccentric load at node_3, with strict limits on max stress-to-weight ratio (≤1.0) and total mass (≤30), ensuring all supports/load nodes stay fixed. The current design is compact and triangulated, but is failing the stress-to-weight constraint. The goal is to rebalance the structure, minimize overstressed members, and improve mass efficiency, all while maintaining a closed form.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "The main constraints are the stress-to-weight ratio and total mass. Current stresses indicate one much higher (member_3: -51.3) than others. Existing structure is a single triangle with an extruded node (node_4), using mostly thin (area_id '1' and '3') but relatively long members. The mass is well within the constraint but the stress ratio is too high (2.87). This points to overstressed members and poor load distribution.",
    
    "analysis": "Node_3 takes a significant inclined load; it is between supports at the base (node_1 pinned, node_2 roller, node_3 roller at load node). The current structure routes much of the load through member_3 (node_3 to node_1); its high compressive force indicates the base triangle configuration is struggling to resolve the moment from the off-center load. The rest of the members bear much less load, leading to inefficient material distribution. Member areas are thin, especially for highly loaded members. The structure is closed but not well-fitted for the load-path. Generation history confirms this pattern—constraint violations stem from stress concentrated in a slender, overloaded member.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "The stresses reveal a classic undersized-chord problem where a key member is sized below demand. The frame is minimally triangulated, making it unstable against force eccentricities. Member_3 chokes under load; other members are oversized given their minor stresses. Adjusting only member areas will increase mass and may not lower the stress ratio sufficiently. Improved triangulation or geometry tuning is needed for better force distribution.",
    
    "proposal": "Redesign for optimal triangulation and more symmetric force paths. Keep the same nodal supports and locations for loaded/supported nodes. Move node_4 higher to improve overturning resistance, and add a fifth node above the midspan between node_2 and node_3 to further triangulate the top chord and distribute the load. Increase area of critically stressed members and resize low-stress members to optimal minimum. The closed polygon is preserved, and all nodes connect via triangles for load stability.",
    
    "reasoning": "By lifting node_4 and introducing node_5 over the base, we create two triangles to share load from the overhanging node_3. This mitigates high force concentrations on any single member. Placing node_5 (above the base between nodes_2 and_3) ensures more vertical load path for the negative y-component of the force. The new layout allows for thicker cross-section only where needed (critical members from node_3 to node_1 and node_4). Support nodes and loaded node retain exact coordinates per constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Material and load remain constant; areas used: area_id '5' for highly loaded member_3; use area_id '1' on low-stress members for efficiency. Geometry: node_4 is moved up to (2.0, 5.0), node_5 added at (4.0, 2.2) (above midpoint of node_2 and node_3 for optimized top chord). Mass calculated as sum(length × area). Key equations: stress = force / area, force assumed distributed by method of joints; major load resolves to vertical webs; ensure all nodes/connectivity for closed structure.",
    
    "calculation": "Estimated loads: Key member (node_3-node_1) previously took 51.3kN with area 0.195; using area_id '5'=4.887 boosts its capacity ~25x, so stress ratio ≈2 reduced under 1. Secondary members sized down to area_id '1'. New node_5 increases number of load paths to node_2, distributing force. Estimated total mass (lengths × area): for 7 members (adds two short diagonals); using mostly area_id '1'=0.195, one area_id '5' at 4.887, all below total mass constraint. Detailed lengths: member_3 is ~2.0m, member_4 is ~5.38m, diagonals ~3.6m–4.4m, sum ≈18m; mass ≈ 9.05 + 8×0.7 = ~14.65 < 30. Max stress on reinforced member is now below 1 × weight cap.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Final checks: all support and loaded nodes fixed. All members triangulated, closed. No member overstressed (using area_id '5' for previous problem member). Total mass satisfies constraint. No isolated nodes, all dictionary entries unique. Node positions set at high precision and are consistent with efficient geometry. Members connect all nodes in a fully triangulated, closed framework.",
