The objective is to form a structurally efficient and constraint-satisfying design (max stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 1.0; total mass ≤ 30) by analyzing the current structure and prior failed attempts, then either iteratively improving or fundamentally redesigning the truss for optimal performance without moving loaded or supported nodes.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives: low mass, low stress-to-weight ratio (≤1.0). Constraints violated in all prior generations, most nearly feasible design at iteration 3. Needs closed truss (no floating/internal-only nodes), efficient force transfer, improved load path for given supports & load.",\n    "analysis": "Key constraints are exceeded in all historical structures—largest culprit being high stress in members or heavy overall mass from inefficient geometry/size assignments. The current structure (iteration 3) uses a rectangular subframe (nodes 1-2-3 with an off-axis node 4), modest triangulation, but member_2 is overstressed (-13.34 vs ~1.09 allowable ratio). Other historical solutions add more nodes or complex triangulation, but worsen mass or fail to lower peak stress. The load at node_3 is heavily downward/left; supports include two rollers and a pinned (adequate for stability if braced correctly). The member with highest stress connects node_1 to node_3, likely too slender or poorly aligned for substantial horizontal/vertical force absorption. Geometric inefficiency is suspected: load path from node_3 bypasses optimal triangles, causing local overstress.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Structural patterns: Most failed attempts have excessive member length, inefficient area assignments, or unoptimized triangles. Triangulation generally improves force distribution (lowers peak member stress). The area near node_3 (with applied load) should use the strongest/shortest paths, likely via direct triangulation between supports and node_3. Possible mass savings in reducing horizontal chord member area. Consider lowering node_4’s y-coordinate for more direct triangles.",\n    "proposal": "Redesign the structure by re-positioning node_4 lower (below node_3), and adding a new node_5 higher up, forming a more symmetric triangulated truss. This allows triangulation from the supports (nodes 1 and 2) directly toward the load (node_3) and reduces long member lengths. Assign higher area sections only where demand is highest (near load application and supports), use smaller areas elsewhere to reduce total mass.",\n    "reasoning": "Triangulated truss structures distribute loads more efficiently, reduce member lengths and peak forces, and use material more judiciously. Placing node_4 below the chord (as a \'knee\') and node_5 above creates a classic Warren/pratt-like truss. Directly bracing from supports (nodes 1, 2) to loaded node (3) via short, strong diagonals works with the strong directions of the load and reactions. Assign large area only to most-stressed diagonals, use minimum area elsewhere.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume: major stresses run through members directly connected to node_3. Use area_id \'3\' (1.759) for these; others can be \'1\' (0.195) to \'2\' (0.782) for modest expected stress. Nodes fixed (supports, load) as per constraint. Move node_4 to (2.0, -1.0) to direct a strong triangle under loaded node, node_5 to (2.0, 2.5) for upper tie. Connect 1-3-2 base, 1-4-3, 4-2, 1-5, 2-5, 3-5. Compute approximate lengths, masses. Enforce full closure/connectivity. Estimate member forces: diagonals at node_3 and verticals take bulk; assign strong area here. Chord (horizontal) can use min. area.",\n    "calculation": "Member lengths (approx): 1-2:6.00, 1-3:2.00, 2-3:4.00, 1-4:2.24, 2-4:4.47, 3-4:1.00, 1-5:2.83, 2-5:4.03, 3-5:2.50, 4-5:3.50. Assign area IDs: highest demand (1-3, 2-3, 3-4, 3-5)→\'3\'; others \'1\'. Total mass ≈ (6*0.195)+(2*1.759)+(4*1.759)+(2.24*0.195)+(4.47*0.195)+(1*1.759)+(2.83*0.195)+(4.03*0.195)+(2.5*1.759)+(3.5*0.195) ≈ 1.17+3.52+7.03+0.44+0.87+1.76+0.55+0.79+4.40+0.68 ≈ 21.01, < 30.
