The latest design fails the stress-to-weight ratio constraint (ratio=4.69>1.0) and is inefficient (high local stress, unnecessary mass). The objective is to redesign for a closed, fully-connected truss which minimizes stress-to-weight ratio and mass, strictly satisfying all constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: stress-to-weight ≤ 1.0, mass ≤ 30, closed and feasible 2D geometry. Pin at node_1; rollers at node_2, node_3; downward/rightward load on node_3. Nodes with loads/supports are fixed. Current and recent solutions exhibit overstressed members and suboptimal mass utilization.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The latest structure uses five nodes (nodes_1,2,3,4,5) with a partial double-triangle, spreading out the applied load at node_3 upward via node_4 and sideways via node_5. Despite multiple upper chords, member_1 (node_1 to node_3) sees massive compressive stress (-64.2), indicating force concentration and ineffective load path divergence. Historic structure \'rank_1\' (nodes_1,2,3,4) forms a compact Warren truss (double triangle) with moderate area assignment and achieves much lower max stress (7.2) and mass (7.97), S/W ratio 0.90 (<1.0). While more minimal, this structure efficiently spreads horizontal and vertical reactions via triangulation and direct force paths. All other designs either exceed max stress (constraint_not_met_2/3/4/5) or waste mass. The only feasible (constraint-satisfying) structure in the history is the \'rank_1\' double-triangle Warren truss.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Only \'rank_1\' in historic generations satisfies all constraints. Its shape is compact, direct, and efficiently triangulated. Slight member area increases or minor node repositioning may further reduce stress, but the basic shape likely already approaches optimal. All nodes are fully connected; no redundancy or gaps. The load is efficiently resolved at node_3 by splitting the force into two-legged triangles to supports at nodes_1 and _2.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Adopt the efficient, constraint-satisfying Warren (double triangle) truss (\'rank_1\') from history. All constraints are met, and the structure is minimal, fully connected, and optimal for the given supports/loads. Each member assignment is precisely as needed; no overdesign or extra nodes/members present. For thoroughness, member area assignments from history are preserved for minimal mass and stress-to-weight ratio, but could be increased slightly for additional factor of safety if desired.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Truss efficiency is maximized using direct, short triangles. The Warren double-triangle distributes the load from node_3 to both supports symmetrically. The pinned and roller supports are correctly placed. The member area assignments (areas 1 for most, area 3 for node_1-node_3) are chosen based on historic stress magnitudes, keeping max member stress well below the threshold. The geometric proportions minimize force eccentricity, torsion, or long lever arms. Node_4 is positioned directly above node_3 to keep CG and force paths direct, minimizing bending. This layout is a classic, robust solution for such loading/support scenarios.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume: Areas from best historic model (\'1\' for all except \'3\' for the bottom diagonal), unit thickness; stress is force/area, total mass = Σ(length × area), total weight = mass (gravity cancels in ratio). Max member stress = |max(member_stress)|. Check: (max member stress / total mass) = 7.21/7.973 ≈ 0.90 (<1.0). All nodes directly participate in force transfer (no isolated nodes). Members form closed loops (no gaps). The support and load geometry is unchanged from problem constraints.",\n    \n    "calculation": "From historic \'rank_1\' solution: member stresses (max 7.21), masses sum to 7.97, s/w ratio = 0.90. Node locations are (node_1: [0.0,0.0], node_2: [6.0,0.0], node_3: [2.0,0.0], node_4: [2.0,3.5]). Structural efficiency comes from forming triangles between all support/load points. Calculation matches historic FEM results and all constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Confirm: no node modifications to supports or load points. Structure is fully connected, closed, triangle-based, and uses minimal fabric. All nodes actively carry force. Stress-to-weight ratio (0.90) is under constraint. Mass (7.97) is well under limit.
