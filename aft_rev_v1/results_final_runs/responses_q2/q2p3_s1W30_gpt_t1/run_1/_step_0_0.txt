    "preamble": "We are given three aligned nodes forming a single base line and a downward-inclined force at node_3. The goal is to design a minimal-weight, closed (fully connected) truss such that the maximum stress-to-weight ratio does not exceed 1.0, with mass constrained by the area table. The main challenge is ensuring structural stability under combined vertical and horizontal load at node_3, given the nearly colinear node arrangement.",

    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes lie on x-axis, all at y=0. Node_1 and node_2 are endpoints (supports), node_3 is between them. Loads are at node_3 (left and downward). I must introduce at least one new node to allow triangulation, forming a rigid, optimally loaded truss with all nodes interconnected. I will add an upper node to create a triangle capable of resisting the force applied at node_3.",

    "analysis": "Support conditions: node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 (roller). Load at node_3 is inclined (-15, -30), i.e., 15 units left and 30 units down. With all nodes on x-axis, any direct connections lie in a straight line; a stable 2D truss is not possible unless we add a new node above this line to close triangles. Adding node_4 above node_3 enables triangulation: we can close triangles (node_1-node_3-node_4, node_3-node_2-node_4, and connect node_1-node_2 for full closure). Strong load path will be node_3 <-> node_4 <-> supports. I must ensure stresses in these members are minimized and areas chosen to satisfy the ratio and mass constraints. All nodes will be interconnected, forming a closed loop.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "The load is asymmetric, but using symmetry in placement of node_4 above node_3 will promote even load distribution (with a vertical y offset). Proper placement of node_4 will not only close the truss but also help transfer forces efficiently to supports. Member forces can be balanced better if node_4 is placed directly above node_3. The triangle formed will give direct vertical support. Optimal member areas will be chosen based on expected maximum force (critical for those directly in the load path, i.e., node_3-node_4 and node_4-node_1/2). The horizontal member node_1-node_2 can be minimal, since force transfer will be indirect.",

    "reasoning": "1. Place node_4 directly above node_3 for efficient vertical force transfer. 2. Connect node_4 to all three base nodes to create two strong triangles for structural stability. 3. Fully connect all nodes. 4. Use the smallest possible area for the base member (node_1-node_2), moderate area for diagonal and vertical members exposed to higher force, based on calculations. All nodes must be part of the structure per constraints.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Key assumptions: - All members are pin-connected. - Truss is statically determinate. Forces in members calculated by method of joints. Steps: 1. Calculate preliminary geometry: node_4 at (2.0, h), h > 0 (above node_3). 2. Determine member lengths. 3. Calculate load angles and projected forces at joints. 4. Select areas so that max(abs(stress)) / total_weight <= 1.0 and total mass <= 30. Decide on h: too tall increases member length (weight); too low, inefficient force transfer. Try h = 3.5. Compute member lengths: node_3-node_4: h, node_4-node_1: √((2-0)^2 + h^2), node_4-node_2: √((6-2)^2 + h^2), node_1-node_2: 6. Heights less than span yield efficient results.",

    "calculation": "Let h = 3.5. Member lengths (all in units): node_3-node_4: 3.5; node_4-node_1: sqrt(4 + 12.25) = 3.81; node_4-node_2: sqrt(16 + 12.25) = 5.10; node_1-node_2: 6.0; node_1-node_3: 2.0; node_2-node_3: 4.0. Total perimeter: 3.5 + 3.81 + 5.10 + 6.0 + 2.0 + 4.0 = 24.41. Assign area IDs: - Major loaded members (node_3-node_4, node_4-node_1, node_4-node_2): area_id '3' (1.759). - Minor base members (node_1-node_2, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3): area_id '0' (1). Mass = Σ (length × area) = (3.5+3.81+5.10)×1.759 + (6.0+2.0+4.0)×1 = (12.41×1.759) + 12.0 = 21.85 + 12 = 33.85. Exceeds mass constraint. Reduce area_id for diagonals: Try '2' (0.782). New mass: (3.5+3.81+5.10)×0.782 + 12 = (12.41×0.782) + 12 = 9.71 + 12 = 21.71. Satisfies constraints. Max member force (node_3-node_4 will take almost full applied load): F ≈ |(-15, -30)| = 33.54. Stress (F/A) for area 0.782: 33.54 / 0.782 = 42.91. Stress-to-weight ratio: 42.91 / 21.71 = 1.98. Exceeds constraint. Increase area on vertical/load-carrying member only: node_3-node_4, area_id '4' (3.128), others remain at '2'. Mass: node_3-node_4: 3.5×3.128=10.948; (3.81+5.10)×0.782=6.965; base=12.0. Total=10.948+6.965+12.0=29.91. Now node_3-node_4 area=3.128; stress=33.54/3.128=10.73; ratio=10.73/29.91=0.36. All constraints satisfied.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "Final node positions: Node_1: (0.00, 0.00); Node_2: (6.00, 0.00); Node_3: (2.00, 0.00); Node_4: (2.00, 3.50). All nodes are part of a closed structure. Members: node_1-node_2 (base), node_2-node_3 (base), node_1-node_3 (base), node_3-node_4 (vertical), node_4-node_1 (left diag), node_4-node_2 (right diag). Assign area_id '0' to base members (low force), '2' to diagonals, '4' to vertical member (high force). All constraints satisfied: stress-to-weight ratio=0.36<1.0, mass=29.91<30.0.",
