"\n        "The main optimization objective is to further minimize the ratio of maximum absolute internal member stress to total truss weight, with maximum allowed values: stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 1.0, mass ≤ 30."\n    ),\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": (\n        "Inputs specify fixed supports at nodes 1, 2, 3 (must stay fixed), and a downwards, mainly horizontal load (-15, -30) at node 3. "\n        "All nodes are referenced in member definitions and no nodes are disconnected. The area dictionary constrains member sizes."\n    ),\n\n    "analysis": (\n        "Current structure forms a well-triangulated quadrilateral with main nodes at ground level (node_1, node_2, node_3) and an apex (node_4) off the base. "\n        "Main compressive members carry loads toward the supported base. Member stresses indicate well-distributed internal force, with member_2 (node_1 to node_3) having the highest magnitude stress (-13.20). Mass is at 23.41 (well below the 30 limit), and stress-to-weight ratio is ~0.56. "\n        "No members are excessively stressed or under-loaded. All constraints are amply satisfied. Prior generations indicate little previous design change."\n    ),\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": (\n        "Efforts should focus on (1) lowering maximum stress through either improved force pathing or member thickening, or (2) reducing mass where stresses are low. "\n        "Member_2 is critical (highest absolute stress); some members (member_5, member_6) carry low stress hence may be lightened for mass savings. There\'s some redundancy near the apex, which is desirable for closure and stiffness. Investigate possible shifts or area reductions."\n    ),\n\n    "proposal": (\n        "Proceed to fine-tune: keep node positions of nodes 1, 2, 3 fixed (supports/loads). Slightly lower node_4 (apex) to tighten alignment with resultant load on node_3 and to decrease the moment arm of member_2 (reducing its stress).

Reducing area_id for member_4, _5, _6 will drop mass significantly, ~6 units.
