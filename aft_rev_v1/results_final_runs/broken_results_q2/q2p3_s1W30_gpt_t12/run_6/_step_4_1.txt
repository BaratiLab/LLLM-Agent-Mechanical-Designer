Currently, most members are lightly stressed, but one lower chord (member_6) sees the maximum stress.",\n\n    "analysis": "Load is applied at node_3 (-15.0N, -30.0N). Supports at nodes_1 (pinned), 2 (roller), 3 (roller) imply that nodes_1,2,3 form a stable base, rest are above the x-axis. Highest member stress is still well below capacity, and high mass is due to member_5 and _6 (using area_id \'3\'). Because member_6 always has max stress, tesselating the upper region and adjusting positions to decrease moment arms should even force distribution, while keeping total mass low by assigning minimum viable areas. Historical best also used smaller member areas, but higher node_4,5 y-coordinates increased member lengths.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Length can be further reduced by pressing node_5 closer to node_3 in the y direction, and pushing node_4 marginally higher to reduce forces in member_6 in trade for slightly greater stress in diagonals (members_3/4). Also, since member_5 is the heaviest for minimal force, minimize unnecessary span by keeping node_2-node_3 close. Diagonal arrangement matters most; remove slack node-to-member geometry.",\n\n    "proposal": "Fine-tune positions of node_5 and node_4 to marginally lower overall structure (reduce lengths, especially for unused capacity diagonals and chords). Set member areas strategically: heavy load paths (lower chord, direct load lines) keep higher areas; highly unstressed elements minimized. Connected closed truss, all nodes retained.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Symmetry and compact triangular tesselation will more evenly distribute loads along shorter paths, minimizing critical member length and mass. Member_6 (node_3-node_1) universally carries most stress—minimize its length by shifting node_5 downward/left and node_4 to optimize diagonals to node_2 (retained at 6,0 for support). Assign largest permitted areas only to members under substantial load (per FEM results), rest to area_id \'1\'.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": [\n        "Main equations:",\n            "- Stress ≈ Force / Area (use member_6 prior result as reference for sizing)",\n            "- Mass = sum(length × area_coefficient)",\n            "- Try node_5 at (2.4, 1.2); node_4 at (4.1, 1.3): moves upper nodes slightly down for shorter members, maintains triangulation.",\n            "- For connection: member_5, _6 (bottom chord) area_id \'3\' (load path); others area_id \'1\'."\n        ],\n        "Assignment by performance-based sizing!",\n        "Estimate updated lengths and forces by geometry."\n    ,\n\n    "calculation": "Assign node_5 = (2.40, 1.20), node_4 = (4.10, 1.30).

Mass≈ (2.7+1.66+1.8+2.06+4+2+6)* respective areas= ~0.53+0.32+0.35+0.40+7.04+3.52+1.17 ≈ 13.33 (well within 30). FE-based estimate: stresses remain <7.14N/unit area on m6, which gives max abs(stress)/mass = 7.14/13.33=0.535, but since member_6 length drops compared to previous best, max may drop just below 0.5302.
