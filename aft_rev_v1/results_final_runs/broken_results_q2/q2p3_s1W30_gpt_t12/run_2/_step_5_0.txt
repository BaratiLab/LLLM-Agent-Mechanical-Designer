The current structure exceeds allowable stress-to-weight by over a factor of three.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: find a 2D truss topology and sizing such that max(abs(stress))/total_weight ≤ 1, and total mass ≤30. External load acts on node_3 (2.0, 0.0), supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 (roller). Past attempts failed on stress ratio, especially due to high demand in key members linked to node_3; member_1 is most overstressed (-49.74) vs its weight (0.39u) in the last iteration.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Key challenge: concentrated eccentric load on node_3 results in high axial force especially in member_1 (\'node_1\'-\'node_3\') due to limited load paths. Trying to lighten the structure has resulted in overstress on critical lower chord members. Structures in history either massively overweight (constraint_not_met_1: >34u), or are lightweight but with overstressed links (others). The numbers indicate node_4/node_5 above or behind the base chord lend little vertical support unless optimized. Current closed trusses use triangulation but vertical distance between the top node and lower chord is moderately insufficient. There may be a potential to optimize by increasing vertical height for load distribution, resizing highly stressed members, and minimizing others for weight.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Past structures are inefficient largely due to: (1) too few vertical or diagonal load paths sharing the vertical component of load, (2) area (section size) reductions that aren\'t focused on the overstressed lower members, and (3) top nodes positioned too narrowly above the base awkwardly. Effective designs (Warren/Pratt truss typology) employ sufficient height for bending moment reduction, symmetry, and direct diagonals to resist both forced and boundary-induced axial forces. All support and loaded nodes must keep their coordinates per instruction.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign topology (retain nodes with supports and load at fixed points), add one new upper node to create greater arching for force distribution, maximizing triangulation height within geometry, choose section areas to ensure all critical stress ratios fall well below 1. Remove redundant non-load-sharing members, and prune member area on low-stress members.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Adopt a high, symmetric six-node two-top, four-bottom chord layout: (1) anchor lower cord (node_1: [0,0]; node_2: [6,0]; node_3: [2,0]), (2) introduce high midspan top node_4 centered at x=3, y=2.8 above midspan to better intercept vertical forces, (3) optionally, secondary top node_5 between nodes_1/node_3 (~x=1,y=1.5) for further triangulation of the left panel – resist vertical shears and minimize long member buckling. All nodes structurally connected with minimal duplication, enforce triangulation throughout for stiffness and sharing load. Assign higher cross-section (\'2\':0.782) for base chord members, minimal sections where possible elsewhere without overstressing.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Main members: lower-chord (1-3, 3-2), top-chord (1-5, 5-4, 4-2), diagonals (1-4, 4-3, 5-3) so load at node_3 rapidly self-distributes upward and left-right. Load path: node_3 pulls force directly via strongest lower-chord members (sections upgraded), vertical component funneled into diagonals ending at high upper nodes, keeping member force ratios safe and indirectly minimizing total material. Force estimate: For -30 vertical, geometry with sufficient triangle height (d~2.5) keeps the chord compression/tension much smaller. Assign big section \'2\' (0.782) to the crucial highly loaded base members and sufficient upper diagonals ~\'1\' (0.195) for less stressed zones. Calculate bar lengths and per member weight and stress exposure from their relative lengths.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Main force in base (\'node_1\'-\'node_3\', \'node_3\'-\'node_2\'): Base members work hardest. With max load vertical and some moment, an adequate top node at y=2.8 above midpoint reduces stress ~by factor ~2 (h increases by 50-70%). Diagonals split load vertically—expect diagonal, top members to see force <40% that of base. Assign: lower chord \'2\' (0.782 mass per L ×2 cleaned, thick), diagonals/top \'1\'–\'2\'. Lengths: lower (2.00→2.00), diagnls sqrt(3^2+2.8^2)=4.1, minor. Estimate total mass as sum(L × area_per_L): expect lower chord2×(2.0+4.0)×0.782≈9.4u (base), diagonals 3.6+2×4.1×0.195≈1.5u, top chord (approx 4+3=7×0.195);<3u. Total < 15, stress to weight with extra height < 1. Key upgrade: maximize triangle heights for moment distribution, prune unreachable members, avoid excess redundancy.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Placed additional high node_4 maximizing vertical separation to y=2.8; kept all load/support nodes in position. Used precise coordinates (avoid coarse increments). Ensured all nodes are connected in a closed triangulation forming Pratt truss type topology.
