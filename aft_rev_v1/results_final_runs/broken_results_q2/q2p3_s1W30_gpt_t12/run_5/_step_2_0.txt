The initial and historic designs both produce much higher stress-to-weight ratios and inefficiencies in load path due to poor triangulation and overconcentration of members splitting the load inefficiently. The goal is to create a light, fully-connected, constraint-satisfying truss assuring minimal mass and adequate safety by improved topology and area assignments.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives clarify that structural stability under asymmetric, inclined loading is primary; Constraints demand stricter topology and sizing adherence than earlier trials; boundary nodes and supports must not move, but other nodes and all connectivity can change.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The main deficiency of previous iterations is seen in grossly exceeded allowable stress-to-weight ratios (current: 3.4, history: ≥3.4). This arises from insufficient or a poorly articulated internal load-carrying system: inclined point load at node_3 is heavy and not triangulated directly. The vertical node_4 trails well above the loaded node; as a result, force transmission pushes too much stress into slender, long verticals and lower horizontals. Failures at member_1 and member_3 indicate this. Additionally, the horizontal span is only partially trussed and not efficiently triangulated for off-axis load dissipation. In historic structure constraint_not_met_2, attempts at a lower triangle make small capacity improvements, but mass and member thinning conversely drive localized overstress. Both approaches use overlong, undersized upright and diagonal members rather than provide multiple, direct load paths. Real stress is dominated by members directly linking supports to the load node, which are not optimally sized or routed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Consistent findings: (1) load at node_3 requires MULTIPLE bracing members to distribute reaction between node_1 and node_2; (2) current upper node is excessive in Y, amplifying bending; (3) member spans and sizes are mismatched – converging to more compact, triangulated nodes would cut mass and length, boost effective sections; (4) need for minimal vertical projection up from the loaded node_3: a low v-shaped apex will shorten high-stress members; (5) existing roller/pinned supports location likely optimal for constraints; (6) none of the current or historic designs truly closes the geometry efficiently under combined loads.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Implement a compact Pratt-like triangle with low apex to speed force transmission from node_3 (loaded) upward. Add a central top node almost above node_3, closing triangulation fast. Keep node_4 directly above or near node_3, lower in Y (<3). Use robust, direct diagonals from node_3 to supports, brace top node_4 with direct members to node_1/node_2. Remove superfluous and overlong vertical/diagonal members. Sizing: stress relief is achieved by making all short/loaded members (notably diagonals and connection to node_4) wider (larger area_ids). Mass constraint allows flexibility but not extreme oversizing—most heavily loaded members can employ area_id \'2\' or \'3\'; all others can be thinner (\'1\'). Proposal is a V-top truss: nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), and a new node_4 at (2,2.2). Members: bottom chord, both diagonals from center load up to supports, two sub-verticals to apex, and also top chords—minimal but routes all forces efficiently and closes up voids.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "The V-truss (almost symmetric, apex centered above force) creates short load paths, directly resolving the off-axis force along strong members and distributing reactions efficiently between the boundary supports (node_1 pinned, node_2 roller). The steeper, shorter apex minimizes overall mass versus a tall upright member. Excessively high apexes make vertex members overly long (adding mass and stress). Two robust diagonals from node_3 (load) up to the compact node_4 can handle split components in the negative-x/negative-y direction; by keeping area_id at least \'2\' here, overstress is prevented since this is where the main force routes. Rest of the top and bottom chords connect apex and support points, completing triangulation. All nodes are directly tied; no isolated segments. The mass constraint is virtually guaranteed due to major member shortening and better area-to-span utilization.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume node_1: (0,0), node_2: (6,0), node_3: (2,0) (by constraints), node_4 next at (2,2.2): yields member_1: (node_1-node_3), member_2: (node_3-node_2), bottom chords; member_3: (node_1-node_4), member_4: (node_2-node_4), top chords; member_5: (node_3-node_4), principal support for load; member_6: (node_3-node_1), one diagonal; member_7: (node_3-node_2), the other; top verticals are eliminated as the V closes the triangle. Calculation: major force in member_5; members_3/4 (top), secondary; other\'s lightly loaded. We\'ll use area_id \'2\' for (node_3-node_4), \'1\' or \'2\' as needed elsewhere; compute unit lengths and mass for all to enforce ≤30 mass. For approximate check: bottom chord = 6 units, top chords ~4.47 units (sqrt((2-0)^2 + 2.2^2)=~3.05, for node_1-node_4); main diagonal = ~2.2 units.
