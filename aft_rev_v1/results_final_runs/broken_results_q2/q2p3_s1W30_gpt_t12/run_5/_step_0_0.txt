The explicit objective is minimizing the ratio of max abs(stress) to total truss weight, with strong penalties for exceeding stress and mass constraints. No previous truss exists; this is a full single-shot optimization guided by deterministic statics.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "We have three nodes: node_1 (0.0, 0.0), node_2 (6.0, 0.0), node_3 (2.0, 0.0), which are co-linear on the x-axis (a significant observation). Supports are: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller, node_3 roller; node_3 is loaded with (-15.0, -30.0) (so 15 kN left, 30 kN down). The singleton sets of nodes all lie on the x-axis, so additional geometry or triangulation may be desired for stability and stress moderation under off-axis load.",\n\n    "analysis": "Co-linearity means in the current state, adding members only amongst the three nodes produces an unstable/collapse-prone system in 2D (zero triangle area); both geometric stability and constraint satisfaction require the introduction of additional off-line node(s). The applied load at node_3 is heavily downward and leftward, which would generate high vertical reactions at the supports if unbraced. Traditional truss efficiency is achieved with direct triangulated paths: currently only a line is possible. Thus, introducing a fourth node (off-axis) allows triangles, improved force distribution, and lower peak stresses for a compliant structure. All supports (pinned/rollers) prevent full movement, but node_3 being a roller may lift under upward force, so geometry guides must anchor load paths via transmission belts to vertical supports at nodes 2 and 3. While increasing node count, weight must be tightly controlled, and shortest usable member lengths provided with appropriate small area selection for uncritical members.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "To satisfy closure and constraint, off-axis triangulation is essential. One possible placement: place a fourth node above or below the current axis, near node_3 where the largest load applies. By placing \'node_4\' at e.g. (2.0, -2.0): this enables triangle formation (nodes 1-3-4, 2-3-4), while remaining member lengths modest. Node connections should thus be (1-3), (3-2), (3-4), (1-4), (2-4); triangles formed are (1,3,4) and (2,3,4): force flows are efficiently distributed, handling downward off-axis loads at node_3, minimizing both force and resulting member stress at minimal extra mass cost. Member areas: choose the smallest that obeys σ = F/A <= allowable, with continous refinement for peak requirements.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Adding node_4 at (2.0, -2.0) provides all nodes with closure, adequate triangulation, and short member lengths. This connects the lower node (projected in line with load at node_3) such that main compressive (vertical) force can flow from node_3 almost straight down through member_3_4, efficiently balancing the vertical load. Simultaneously, triangles with node_1, node_2 capably resist leftward forces, decreasing stress/weight by minimizing both force and length in highly loaded members. Remaining (horizontal) tie members lock truss shapes and redundantly constrain, but can be assigned leanest admissable area for lower weight. All nodes and members together remain single-lattice/closed, as required.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: allowable member stress = 1.0 × weight. Units normalized appropriately. Each area\'s proportional weight, use actual member lengths from geometry. Solve static equilibrium at node_3: three concurrent unknowns → tie member forces per trigonometric resolution: Main vertical at member_3_4, side-ties along 1-3 and 2-3, remaining node reactions tally as free body balance. Expected: F_vertical ≈ dynamic/y-weighted; main diagonals next. Set up lengths via Euclidean distance; assign tentative area_id: target \'3\' (=1.759) or \'2\' (=0.782) for most, \'1\' for accessory ties. Evaluate stress=F/A for each, member mass = length*area. Compute max(abs(stress)). If ratio>1.0, iterate up to nearest higher area_id for failed member, re-verify.
