Supports fix node_1 (pinned) and allow roller displacement at node_2 and node_3. With these boundary conditions, a stable closed truss must triangulate nodes to resist bending and shear from this eccentric load. Direct connection between node_1 and node_2 forms base; adding a new node above creates an optimum triangle to distribute axial forces. The stress-to-weight ratio constrains both member sizing and total structure mass.","\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "With only 3 collinear nodes, the truss is open and unstable under the eccentric load; introducing a new node elevated above node_3 midpoint will create triangular geometry. Using the midpoint between nodes_2 and 3 raises triangulation efficiency. Members should be assigned higher areas for tension/compression members-to keep stresses low, and lower areas elsewhere to conserve mass.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Place one new node_4 at (4.00, 3.00) (above nodes_2 and 3 midpoint) forming two triangles: Gird base nodes 1 & 2 & 4, and upper node 4 linked to node_3. This configuration distributes load through member 3-4, 4-2, and 4-1, reducing stress and increasing stability. Member area choice reflects load path: longer/high loaded members get bigger area values, less loaded smaller.
