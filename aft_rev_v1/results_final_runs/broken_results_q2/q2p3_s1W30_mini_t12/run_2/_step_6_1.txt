Objective is to design a minimal mass, efficient, closed 2D truss with proper load transfer and support reactions, satisfying stress-to-weight ratio ≤1.0 and total mass ≤30.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given loads at node_3 only; supports fixed at node_1 (pinned), and roller supports at node_2 and node_3. Current nodes along x-axis with a single elevated node_4 at approx (2.95, 2.7). Current members provide incomplete triangulation and uneven force distribution leading to inefficiencies. Need to achieve a stable triangulated closed structure with balanced load paths.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 introduces downward force with horizontal component (-15, -30). Node_1 pinned fixes both x/y displacements; node_2 and node_3 rollers restrict vertical displacement but allow horizontal movement. Current structure is a trapezoidal shape with a top node_4 elevated moderately. The analyzed historical designs show improving efficiency when top node is at ~2.95 to ~2.95 vertically shifted. Current oversized member_1 connecting node_1 to node_3 area_id \'5\' (large section) carries high stress and mass, member_6 long base at enlarged area_id \'3\'. High total mass from heavy base and left side members indicating poor load path. Closed truss needed; currently the nodes and members do not form a fully rigid triangulation to distribute stresses uniformly.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Historical ranks show optimum designs with top node heights between ~2.5 to 2.95 elevating well for triangulation. Large sections on base members reduce performance by raising mass without sufficient stress utilization. Smaller, well-placed members forming triangle network with top node enhances force routing. Suggest using area_id mid-range (2 or 3) except for top chord which may use lighter. Smaller members near load avoid concentration. Plan to keep fixed supports node_1 and node_2 locations, node_3 fixed loaded/roller node. Small adjustments in node_4 to optimize triangulation and member area distribution needed minimizing mass and stress.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Redesign the structure by fixing node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), and node_3 (2,0); raise node_4 to (2.95, 2.95) to form a symmetric, well-triangulated structure given prior best rank_1 insight but optimized member area ids to reduce mass and stress-to-weight below 1.0. Adjust member areas, reducing oversized areas especially on foundation members, increase use of mid to low area_id (1 or 2) strategically for secondary members to lower mass while maintaining strength on primary members connecting top and supports. Connect all nodes as closed truss for full triangulation via:\n- main diagonals node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_4-node_3\n- base members node_1-node_2, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_3\n- keep member_5 node_3-node_4 as light to support corner load.\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangulation provides high rigidity. Center node_4 raised symmetrically provides efficient load path to supports along base members and diagonals transferring hanger load at node_3. The pinned and roller supports arrangement guides reaction distribution. Estimate length-based mass; base members longest (~6m) - assign medium section area_id \'3\' or \'4\'; triangles sides roughly 3-4m length - lighter sections \'1\' or \'2\' suffice. Larger sections on critical load paths carrying compressive or tensile stresses. Verify that max stress divided by weight under 1 and total mass near but under 30 kg.
