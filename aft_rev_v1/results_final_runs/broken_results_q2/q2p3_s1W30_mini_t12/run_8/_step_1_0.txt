The objective is to design a closed truss connecting these nodes plus node_4 to reduce stress concentration and total weight below 30 while improving load distribution and triangulation.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Current design includes 4 nodes with a triangular upper section and multiple members of area_id \'3\' plus some \'1\', but member_4 experiences excessive compressive stress (-35.1). Footprint length and heaviness of members near load node_3 cause overload. Constraints: stress-to-weight <= 1.0 and mass <= 30.",\n   \n    "analysis": "Nodes 1 (pinned) and 2,3 (roller) define supports, node_3 has a large downward-left load (-15, -30). Members between nodes 1-3 are thin but highly stressed, especially member_4 from node_1 to node_3; too light and loaded. Current design uses some heavy members near node_4 and connecting multiple nodes, yielding mass ~26 and stress-to-weight 1.3575 >1.0 indicating stresses exceed material resistance or mass is too high for these forces. The weak link is direct member_1-3 (member_4), that has peak stress magnitude exceeding safe limits. Generation history shows no better structure. The structure is a trapezoidal frame that doesn\'t optimally transmit forces with load at node 3.",\n   \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Load directly on node_3 pulls down, causing bending stress on members 1-3 lines. Triangulation improving load distribution and reducing member lengths/stress could help. Reposition of node_4 slightly higher to increase member angle might reduce member length and increase efficiency. Use larger cross-section areas selectively for critically stressed members rather than uniform heavy members everywhere to reduce total mass and manage stress better.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Retain nodes 1, 2, and 3 with their locations since these have supports and loads. Slightly raise node_4 vertically to create better triangulation, and add extra diagonal member 3-2 to complete triangle network for stiffness. Reassign member areas: use larger areas only for the most stressed members to reduce stress-to-weight below 1 while not oversizing others to keep under mass limit. Remove redundant low stress members or reduce cross-section area. New closed truss with 5 members reliably transferring load via triangle with optimized member sizing.",\n   \n    "reasoning": "Principles: Fully triangulate the structure to prevent mechanism and distribute forces. Keeping node_4 higher (around y ~4.5) increases angles hence member length and reduces tension/compression per unit length. Larger area cross-section on critical members carrying heavy load (1-4, 3-4) reduce stress ratio. Lighter cross sections on horizontal base (1-2). Add secondary bracing 2-3 to close triangular load path and stabilize node_3 under vertical-left load. Load path follows node_3 through 3-4 and 4-1 reducing direct overload on 1-3. Design balances structural redundancy and mass limits.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths from coordinates, estimate member tensions/compressions by resolving load via joints: equilibrium at node_3 (load), at node_4 (intermediate node), at supports (1,2). Calculate mass = sum(length * area). With better triangulation, balance stress so max member stress / total mass ≤ 1.0. Assign area_id \'4\' (3.128), or \'3\'(1.759) for critical members, \'1\' (0.195) for low stress base members. Verify mass ≤ 30, confirm max stress ≤ total mass to achieve stress-to-weight ≤ 1.
