Objective is a fully connected triangular truss augmented with one internal node to better distribute stresses under the angled load, minimizing mass and max stress, meeting constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes form a partial line 0 ≤ x ≤ 6: node_1 at origin pinned (fixed in both directions), node_2 at x=6 roller support (vertical reaction only), and node_3 at x=2 with an applied load of -15N at -30 degrees angle below horizontal. Need a closed structure ensuring all nodes connect. The direct line connections (0-2-6) cannot resist angled load effectively - triangulation needed.",\n    \n    "analysis": "To resist the angled point load (-15N, -30°) at node_3, we induce vertical and horizontal reactions at supports. The pinned node_1 can supply reactions in both x and y, roller node_2 only vertical. For stability, the triangle formed by connecting all nodes alone is insufficient against angled loads and large shear due to load offset. Adding a fourth node above the line enables a diamond or two-triangle structure to distribute forces more evenly and reduce max stress. Closed truss means all nodes are connected, creating at least two triangles, avoiding zero member forces.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Single triangle made by (node_1-node_2-node_3) only cannot minimize stress-to-weight ratio due to large bending moment around node_1. Adding node_4 above node_3 x=4.0 or similar height around 3.5m can subdivide truss into two triangles (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4) sharing the apex node_4. This improves stability and force distribution.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Placing node_4 at (4.0, 3.5) above the baseline will form two symmetrical triangles sharing node_3 on baseline. This splits the load more efficiently into axial forces through members. We\'ll use area_ids preferentially starting with mid-sized areas (e.g., \'3\' referenced 1.759 unit area) to balance mass and strength. The node positions remain fixed at known supports and loads; only node_4 new is added. Members defined for full connectivity: bottom line 1-3, 3-2, and new diagonals 1-4, 3-4, 2-4 to form diamond.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assuming each member carries axial load computed from static equilibrium. Calculate total mass = sum(length_i * area_i). Max(stress) approximated by max(force_i)/area_i; stress-to-weight ratio = max(stress)/total_mass ≤ 1 constraint. Iteratively adjust area_id selections between \'3\'-\'5\' to ensure stress-to-weight and mass ≤30. Static equilibrium uses load decomposition at node_3, reactions at node_1 and 2.
