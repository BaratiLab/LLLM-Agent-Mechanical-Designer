Current iteration 5/25 violates constraints with max stress-to-weight ratio above 0.33 and total mass over 37 > 30 limit. Objective is to generate a closed, fully triangulated truss with minimized stress-to-weight ratio below 1.0 and total mass below 30 while maintaining fixed node positions of supports and load.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective constraints: max(abs(stress))/total_weight <= 1.0, total mass <= 30.\\nLoads: Node_3 carries -15 N x, -30 N y.\\nSupports at nodes 1 (pinned), 2 and 3 (rollers); nodes 1 and 2 span base (6.0m apart). Nodes 4 and 5 are elevated points for triangulation.\\nCurrent design insufficiently triangulated around node_3 with some high stress elements and excessive total mass mainly from large area members between base nodes and from node_4.\\nLast attempts showed near feasibility with different node_4 and node_5 elevations and members that created full triangles and load paths, but total mass often exceeded 30 or stress still too high.",\n  "analysis": "Current designs show violation mainly from large mass in members 1 and 4 connecting base nodes and node_4, despite small stressed elements around node_3 indicating load concentration issues. Multiple refinement attempts with different node_4 and node_5 configurations improved stress spread but often increased total mass beyond limits, suggesting member area too large or poorly targeted. Member 1 (node_1-node_2) often large area 3, contributing heavily to mass.\\nLoad path: Load at node_3 introduces bending and compression in members connecting to base nodes and top nodes (node_4, node_5). Current designs miss fully closed triangulation on right side (node_3, node_4, node_5, node_2) leading to concentrated member stresses.\\nBest partial historic designs indicate smaller top spans and more triangulated segments reduce stress peaks. Bringing nodes closer vertically (raised node_4 to 3.7m) helped but raised mass due to longer member lengths and necessity for thicker areas.\\nLocated highly stressed member-2 (node_1-node_3) with area 2 causing heavy stress suggests load transmission should redistribute across multiple paths.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns from histories: smaller spans between node_4 and node_5, and inclusion of a direct diagonal member from node_2 to node_4 distribute forces more evenly. Long base members with large areas increase total mass, so smaller area and increased triangulation preferred. \\nAvoid direct load transfer only to node_1 or 2 by adding direct links from node_3 to nodes higher up (node_5), creating multiple load paths.\\nInsight: a 5-node closed kite-shaped truss with strong triangulation and modest areas less than 3 can reduce stresses and mass.\\nConstraints remind that heavier members can be too costly, so aim to pick area_id <= 3 and keep lengths manageable.",\n  "proposal": "Based on analysis, redesign is proposed with fixed base nodes (node_1:0,0; node_2:6,0; node_3:2,0), raise nodes 4 and 5 slightly to approximately (3.0,3.5) and (4.2,4.5) to shorten diagonal members, use full triangulation: connect node_1 to node_4, node_3 to nodes 4 and 5, node_2 to nodes 4 and 5, and close triangle base to node_3. Choose mostly area_id = \'2\' or \'3\' (available areas=0.782,1.759) for better balance, reduce largest members areas like base with area \'3\', and avoid excessive mass imbalance. Resulting structure should be closed, triangulated, and well supported for load distribution and satisfy mass and stress constraints.",\n  "reasoning": "A stable 2D truss with pinned and roller supports needs full triangulation to avoid mechanisms. Fixing the base and nodes with load ensures no deformation constraints violated.\\nUsing raised nodes 4 and 5 provide a stable top profile shortening member lengths from load node. Using multiple connecting diagonals from load node_3 redistributes forces.\\nReducing area for base (node_1-node_2) to \'2\' reduces mass significantly, as it\'s a long member. Diagonals sized higher to manage loads.\\nTotal member length for mass: choose length ~3-5m for diagonals to node_4 and node_5; balance member areas to match limits for total mass <=30.\\nStress is proportional roughly to applied loads and member force / area. Increased triangulation reduces member forces so area can be reduced, keeping stresses below thresholds. Therefore, close triangulation with moderate size members is critical.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions:\\n- Areas selected from given keyed regions\\n- Member length derived via Euclidean distance\\n- Member mass approx = length * area\\n- Max stress assumed commensurate with load distribution;
