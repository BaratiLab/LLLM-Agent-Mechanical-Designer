Objective is to generate a closed, fully connected truss minimizing max(abs(stress))/weight <= 1.0 and total mass <= 30, using precise floating nodes and given area IDs.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes are collinear at y=0: node_1(0,0), node_3(2,0), node_2(6,0). Load of magnitude 15 units at -30° applied at node_3. Supports constraint lateral-horizontal at node_1 pinned, vertical reaction at node_2 roller, node_3 allowed vertical translation roller; thus vertical equilibrium critical. Objective to create closed truss means at least one additional node and triangulation. Collinear node arrangement limits direct triangulation, need new node above to form triangles and transfer shear and bending.",\n\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 downward-left requires structural resistance at pinned node_1 and roller node_2 possibly transferring reactions horizontally and vertically. Single line members would be inefficient and unstable. To achieve closure and triangulate, a new node placed above nodes enhances stability and load transfer. Triangles reduce bending moments and spread tensions/compressions. Members selected to form two triangles: (node_1, node_3, new_node) and (node_3, node_2, new_node) to share loads. Member cross sections (area_ids) allocated heavier near supports and load path, gradually lighter in tension legs to optimize weight. Mass bounded by sum(length * area). To improve stress distribution, new node is halfway between node_3 and node_1 horizontally, placed above at 3.5 units height. This placement reduces member length and ensures load distribution.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "New node_4 at (1.0, 3.5) allows formation of two essential triangles. Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_3-node_1; and node_4-node_3, node_4-node_2, node_2-node_3. All other nodes connected to form closed loop. Estimated total length around ~20+ units; Area_id carefully selected to keep mass <30. Loads can be transferred primarily via compression in members joining to pinned support. Roller constraints limit moments, so diagonal compressive rods carry most loads. Assumptions needed for member forces based on statics and geometry.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Due to downward-left load, members from pinned support to loaded node and from loaded node to roller must form tension/compression paths triangulated by new node. Area selection in sets: heavy area "7" near pinned support; moderate "3" for diagonals taking both tension/compression; light areas "1" for members generically unloaded or with low axial forces. Node_4 placed off main line promotes closed form and limit torsional or bending stress per members. Avoid added complexity or more nodes to keep mass down.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume linear elastic members, uniform properties, unit density. Calculate member lengths via Euclidean distance, member forces by equilibrium (sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0) in 2D and moment balance about node_1 and node_2. Calculate axial stresses using member force/area. Calculate member mass=(length*area). Total mass=sum masses. Constraint check: max stress/total mass ≤1.0, total mass ≤ 30. Approximate trigonometry for diagonal lengths sqrt(dx²+dy²). Use tangent of 30° in direction components to resolve load. Area id mapping from the given set used numerically.",\n\n    "calculation": "Node_4 = (1.0, 3.5) length calculations: L(node_1-node_4)=sqrt((1-0)^2 + (3.5-0)^2)=3.64 ; L(node_4-node_3)=sqrt((2-1)^2 + (0-3.5)^2)=3.64; L(node_3-node_1)=2.0 (given) ; L(node_4-node_2)=sqrt((6-1)^2 + (0-3.5)^2)=6.10; L(node_2-node_3)=4.00.

Total_mass ≈ 3.64*9.578 + 3.64*7.037 + 2.0*0.195 + 6.10*4.887 + 4.0*1.759 = 34.86 + 25.60 + 0.39 + 29.82 + 7.04 = approx 97.7 > 30 Too heavy -> reduce areas.
