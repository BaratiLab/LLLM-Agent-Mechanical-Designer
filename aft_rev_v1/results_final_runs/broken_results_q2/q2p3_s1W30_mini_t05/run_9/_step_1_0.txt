The objective is to redesign the truss to satisfy stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 1.0 and total mass ≤ 30, maintaining given supports and loads, and ensuring a closed, efficient truss.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The load is concentrated at node_3 with a force (-15, -30). Supports fix node_1 (pinned) and nodes_2 and 3 (rollers). The current structure is a quadrilateral with a diagonal member. Stress concentrates on member_1 (-16.42) causing constraint violation.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current structure has a high stress on member_1, likely due to its low area (2) and load transfer path from node_3 to node_1. The mass is moderate (14.225) but stress-to-weight ratio is above 1.0, indicating overstressed members or inefficient geometry. The load at node_3 is vertical and horizontal, causing bending moments on members connected to node_3. The current members do not form a fully triangulated system around node_3, reducing load path efficiency. The structure is closed but not fully triangulated, which limits stiffness and increases stress. The member areas are not optimized for load distribution, especially member_1 and member_5.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The key issue is high stress in member_1. The lack of triangulation between node_2 and node_4 reduces load distribution efficiency. Node_3 is on the baseline line between node_1 and node_2, which may cause bending stresses on members connected there. Adding a diagonal between node_1 and node_2 or repositioning node_3 vertically to create better triangulation may help. Increasing member areas selectively can reduce stress but increases mass. A balanced approach is needed.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss by repositioning node_3 vertically above the baseline to improve triangulation and load paths. Add a diagonal member between node_1 and node_2 to complete triangulation. Adjust member areas to reduce stress on critical members. Keep supports and load nodes fixed. This will create a stable triangular truss with better load distribution and lower stress-to-weight ratio.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By moving node_3 upward (e.g., y ~ 1.5) while keeping x fixed (2.0), it forms two triangles: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_3-node_2-node_4, improving load paths. Adding member_6 between node_1 and node_2 closes the base triangle. This triangulation reduces bending and distributes forces as axial loads. Member areas are chosen to balance mass and strength, with larger areas on members under higher stress (e.g., member_1 and member_6). Supports remain unchanged to maintain boundary conditions.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Load at node_3 is (-15, -30). Node_1 at (0,0) pinned, node_2 at (6,0) roller, node_3 moved to (2,1.5), node_4 at (2,3.5). Member lengths calculated via distance formula. Member areas selected from given set. Axial force equilibrium equations applied at nodes 3 and 4. Mass = sum(length*area). Stress proportional to force/area. Aim stress-to-weight ≤ 1.0. Iterative adjustment of areas to reduce max stress. Added member_6 (node_1-node_2) area to improve base stiffness.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1 (0.00,0.00), node_2 (6.00,0.00), node_3 (2.00,1.50), node_4 (2.00,3.50).
