The current concept (Iteration 0) has violated constraints: stress-to-weight ratio greatly exceeds the allowed 0.5 limit (actual is 13.75), though the total mass is low. The main goal is to propose a feasible, minimum-mass, closed-truss geometry that satisfies all constraints while carrying the large downward and leftward load at node_3.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Stress-to-weight > 0.5 is a severe violation. The likely driver is excessive force in member_1 between node_1 and node_3 (see max_stress of nearly 60, with member_1 at -60). Current topology is a square with a diagonal, and poor triangulation. Must flatten stress peaks and achieve real closure and distribution.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The truss spans horizontally from node_1 (0, 0) to node_2 (6, 0), with supports at both ends and at node_3 (2, 0). Node_4 (2, 2.2) creates a high, shallow rectangle above node_3 with vertical and horizontal bracing. The main force at node_3 (-15, -30) produces a large reaction, mostly in the member from node_1 to node_3, resulting in the stress peak. Members to node_4 distribute some force to node_2, but the almost square shape means poor triangulation—excessive internal moments and local force concentrations. The structure isn\'t triangulated enough and is nonoptimal with respect to the force path, as member_3 (node_1 to node_4) is short and inconvenient for significant load transfer. This leads to excessive individual member stresses. Area selection and layout do not favor an efficient, closed truss.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Overstressed member (likely due to an undersized area, but choosing a huge area will only increase weight—gain-limited by constraint 2). Triangulation is weak. Form resembles an open frame, offering little stiffness out of plane, thus excessive stress occurs. Closure, extra diagonals, smarter nodal placement, and alignment to reaction lines can help. Arrange new node(s) to permit all triangles, as polygon arrangements (other than triangles) always risk instability.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign, fully triangulated and closed geometry: Keep required supports and loads at fixed nodes. Introduce a single top node (node_5) somewhat above node_3, connecting node_1, node_2, node_3, and node_4 to node_5. Add critical diagonals to form double-triangle structure reminiscent of a Pratt truss. Re-optimize y-coordinates of upper nodes to allow good angles for both vertical and left forces. All nodes form a closed envelope; no isolated or unbraced segments. Increase some members\' areas judiciously for good redistribution. Give all lower joints strong vertical and diagonal bracing to the top. Select only as many members as needed for both load and closure.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A double-triangle (five nodes: three bottom, two top) spread between main span and node_3 will create robust load flow, utilizing shortest force paths, almost eliminating bending and stress amplifications. Align top node above load for best direct transfer; diagonals route forces to both supports reflexively. All triangles foster stability; proper member sizing ensures effective load-sharing within strict mass limits.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": [\n        "Keep nodes 1, 2, 3 fixed (supports and loads can\'t move per instructions); move or stretch top nodes.",\n        "Introduce node_5 above load node (2.0, mid-y).
