The truss must resist an oblique (down-and-left) force at node_3, subject to pinned and roller supports and strict limits on both mass (<=30) and stress-to-weight ratio (<=0.5).",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs: Three colinear base nodes along x=0, x=2, x=6. Supports pin left, roller mid & right. Only single jointed force at the interior node_3 (-15, -30), requiring a triangulated, closed topology. Constraints are strict, prioritizing high efficiency; triangle frames favored for direct force flow. Area choices must judiciously use \'small\' values for low weight while maintaining capability for stress mitigation. Some geometry extension is likely necessary for efficient force paths.",\n\n    "analysis": "The span is from (0,0) to (6,0) with a critical force at (2,0). All supports on x axis; only external force at center. Any member connected so that node_3 forms at least one triangle is essential for closure and distributing the oblique force directly to the supports. With supports constrained horizontally (pinned/roller), horizontal and vertical reactions are available at node_1, vertical only at the other two. A narrow triangle (flat-or-low-profile) would put excessive force into very short horizontal members; a \'roof/triangle\' geometry allows for vertical and angular force paths and member size fine-tuning. To close the structure efficiently, adding one new node above the axis for a symmetric triangle is favored (e.g., at the centroid or similar), achieving both stability and minimal member forces.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a single apex node \'node_4\' above (x=3.0, y=h) supports direct force flow path. Triangular geometry should trisect the x-basis for optimal angle dispersion under combined loads. Member IDs, areas should be chosen so lengths x A are balanced for stress limits. Engineering judgment suggests a height around y=2.5~3.5 for aggressive force angle reduction.",\n\n    "reasoning": "A single-order (simple) triangle is the smallest, lightest closed stable truss—adding a single apex node maximizes the efficiency of force distribution, combining lowest member length sum with highly effective load triangulation. Joining each original base node with \'node_4\' and closing the base forms a single triangle, splitting forces into gravity and side-shear paths about the triangle perimeter. Assign smallest area IDs to base (compression) and moderate areas to \'sloped\' members as they see highest stress (due to the vertical force vector). Symmetry is optimal; so place node_4 at (3.00, 2.50), yielding nearly uniform lengths and good force sharing.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: between base supports (node_1 to node_2: 6), node_1 to node_3: 2, node_2 to node_3: 4, node_1 to node_4/summit: hypot(3.0,2.5) = 3.91, node_2 to node_4 = same, node_3 to node_4: 1.80. Choose compact but distinct member set: All boundary nodes linked to node_4 (apex), keeping structure minimal and efficient. Sum lengths × area for total mass. Stress triangles based on joint equilibrium with oblique force: estimate highest in \'inclined\' legs (node_3-node_4), so assign area accordingly. Use as many \'1\' area members as symmetry and ratio allow. Use simple trigonometric (CFD) for estimating force in each member under the 15 kN left & 30 kN down load at node_3.",\n\n    "calculation": "Vertices: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(3.0,2.5). Members: node_1-node_2 (base:6.00), node_1-node_4 (3.91), node_2-node_4 (3.91), node_3-node_4 (1.80), node_1-node_3 (2.00), node_2-node_3 (4.00) — total length ≈ 21.62. Assign areas for max efficiency: base and internal edges get area \'1\'=0.195 (node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_4); legs to node_4 get area \'2\'=0.782; base support edge can be area \'0\'=1.00. Weight=6*1+3.91*0.782+3.91*0.782+1.8*0.195+2*0.195+4*0.195=6+3.06+3.06+0.35+0.39+0.78≈13.64<30. Joint equilibrium: Largest stress in sloped legs due to oblique P: roughly P/member_cosθ~33/2 members (about 20 in each sloped leg). stress_sloped = (hypothesize) 23/0.782 ≈ 29.4. Total weight=13.64; S/W≈2.16>0.5? Too high. Make legs area \'6\'(7.037), rest keep same: weight = legs:3.91*7.037*2 = 55.04 — now total exceeds constraint. Instead, try both sloped at area \'4\'=3.128 (legs:3.91*3.128*2=24.47), total =6+24.47+… estimate total ~35 >30. Refine: raise apex lower (2.0), reducing lengths, so (3,2): legs = sqrt(9+4)=3.61, sum=6+3.61*0.782*2+1.8*0.195+others=6+5.65+0.35… try: assign base area \'1\' (0.195) and sloped \'2\' (0.782), total ~6+5.65+0.35+others=~13, still S/W > 1; make all areas as large as possible within W constraint. At area \'7\' (9.578)*3.61*2=69.16, overshoots total mass. Balance using area \'2\'(0.782) or \'3\'(1.759): S = (max force 25)/area up to 30, aim for S < 15. Try area \'3\'(1.759): sloped= 3.61*2*1.759=12.72. Total ~19.
