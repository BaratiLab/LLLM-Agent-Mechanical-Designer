The last structure failed the key constraint: max(|stress|)/total_mass ≤ 0.5, and had a marginal mass advantage (8.688 < 30) but lacked efficiency. Structural redesign is needed to reach feasible, optimal performance.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given the constraints, I must reduce the max stress or increase mass for lower stress-to-weight ratio, yet now the design is almost a straight bar with inefficient member arrangement. Nodes and supports are locked except for node adjustment and member configuration, using only allowed area_id options.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Referring to the present and historical structure: both use three colinear nodes (all y=0) — an inefficient scheme known to result in high axial forces from off-axis loads. Members barely triangulate, providing no vertical stability or force distribution, thus driving up member stress. Both feasible and historical options overlook closing diagonals to form stable kinematic shapes. Applying vertical and slanted members, revised node positioning (adding or adjusting y-locations) increases load path diversity, thereby reducing max stress. Furthermore, a traditional triangle (placing node_3 above x-axis) with diagonals minimizes force length and increases effective bridged height for vertical loads. Optimal area selection stems from rough member forces if new geometry is drastically less shaky.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Major shortcoming in prior solutions: collinearity. Only full triangles allow for direct force path transmission. The vertical force from node_3 can\'t be taken effectively by horizontal members. Modification: lift node_3 upwards (e.g., y>0) to provide the triangle. Use minimum needed area Id on shorter compress/tension members; Chunkier ones for obvious compressive members (lowest mass authority). Choose base at x=0 and x=6, apex laterally centered.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss by moving node_3 upwards (breaking collinearity, e.g., node_3 at (3.0, 2.4)), forming a classic statically determinate triangle; connect all three nodes for a closed system, each member is well-positioned to carry compressive/tensile action from given loads. Choose the smallest area able to resist maximum calculated member force with significant margin; ensure all constraints are satisfied.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Symmetry and triangulation best resist gravity and horizontal shear components. By moving node_3 up (forming a triangle at (3.0, 2.4)), we halve effective member loading for the given load. Design goal: downward force at apex splits into tens/compressive force in inclined members and tension below. For short base members (compression, likely highest load), assign a moderate area ID; diagonals and tie with lowest feasible one.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "- Assume deadweight negligible, focused on applied force at node_3: (-15, -30).\\n- Nodal geometry: node_1 (0,0) pinned, node_2 (6,0) roller, node_3 (3,2.4) roller and loaded. \\n- Triangulate: members (1-2), (1-3), (2-3).\\n- Compute member lengths: base=6, both diagonals ~ (root(3^2+2.4^2)) ≈ 3.84.\\n- Use method of joints or geometry to assess member force magnitudes; pick area (by area_id) for each under max force plus margin; verify ratio max(abs(stress))/total_mass <=0.5; keep total_mass < 30.\\n- For new geometry, member_2 (apex left) and member_3 (apex right) inclined: expect similar load shares.",\n    \n    "calculation": "1. member_1 (node_1-node_2): length=6.00; members_2/3: length=sqrt((3)^2 + (2.4)^2)=3.84.\\n2.
