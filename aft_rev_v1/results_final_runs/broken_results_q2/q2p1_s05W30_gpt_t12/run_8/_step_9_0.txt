Multiple previous trial structures have violated max stress or weight ratio constraints. A structure with solid triangulation and efficient load transfer is required. Current generation is governed by support and load requirements: nodes_1,2,3 fixed on the x-axis, with node_1 pinned and node_2,3 roller, and load applied at node_3.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Goal: Satisfy max|stress|/weight ≤0.5 and mass ≤30 with a closed, efficient truss. The last-best design is 1.4 for stress:weight, which is oversized in some members and under-optimized in weight or area for stressed members.",\n\n    "analysis": ("Current and past designs rely on tripodal and Warren (double-triangle) schemes against the short span (6m base) and moderate height, biased toward the left (due to 2:1 unbalanced downward LEFT load at node_3). Excess of over-stressed bottom chord members in the left part emerges from too tight triangulation/higher forces routed into lower-area members, while large extras up add mass. Historic structures (esp. constraint_not_met_3, constraint_not_met_4) show overloading in left-most bottom members. Any reduction in member cross-section or removal strongly affects max|stress|, showing under-triangulation leftward. Configurations with two top nodes (at ~1/3 and ~2/3 discrete heights) reduce member longest length near loaded node and can allow recirculation of forces into stouter top chords rather than bottom. Increasing the effective height and optimizing inner node positions may enable both mass savings and better route compression/tension."),\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Balance and closed loop triangulation essential. More efficient to saddle the load path left with two upper chord nodes plus triangulation to bring load toward both supports. Current node with max stress is at the high loaded region (node_3, member_1). Relief possible with more efficient top node placement and distributing force among chords via diagonal bracing.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign—to close a double-triangle (Warren + extra central top node) configuration. Introduce a top node near node_3’s x (slightly off to allow intersect), and another closer to midpoint of the bottom base. Key: all supports/loaded nodes remain at given places. Link these with a minimal set of triangulated members choosing lower area_id for less loaded links, moderate for the critical ones near high applied load and reaction, balancing area_id to minimize max|stress| and therefore satisfy ratio constraint.",\n\n    "reasoning": (\n        "For efficient 2D truss subjection to strong unsymmetric loading, the best weight-to-stress performance comes from making force paths short and direct for large forces, with smallest possible member lengths and close triangulation. Double-triangle (or three-chord truss variations) with top nodes above node_3 and above midspan dissipate compression upward, greatly decreasing local member force at the bottom left. Assign largest available area only where absolutely required (bottom near node_1 <-> node_3 or spanning node_1 directly). The rest receive reduced section. All nodes, esp. top ones, must link to at least 3 members (closure mandated; avoid kinematic instability). Strategic node placement: (node_5) at (2.2, 1.1); (node_6) at (4.0, 1.5).",\n    ),\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": (\n        "Key assumptions: Area-to-stress is determined most critically at the loaded/support edge (node_3 and bot chord mid-left). Bottom member (node_1<->node_3) is likely max compression/tension; choose area \'4\' (3.128@1.564, seems excessive; we must minimize), but area \'2\' (0.782@1.564, already nearly over limit). Try designated higher areas only there. All other member mass and length calculated by d=sqrt((x1-x2)^2+(y1-y2)^2). Weight is Σ(member len × area). Estimate member force by load paths: node_3\'s vertical and left load splits roughly via top nodes—it is supported directly backward, and diagonally up/mid. Assign area \'3\' for other highly stressed; use area \'1\' or \'2\' for shorter and less loaded.\xa0"\n    ),\n    \n    "calculation": (\n        "Place node_5 at (2.1, 1.2) directly above node_3, forming left triangle; node_6 at (4.1, 1.25).

Compute each member’s length; mass by multiplying out. Estimate: all members clearly connected, nearly uniform force-sharing in truss—stress per member will range such that with area ‘3’ on main loaded links, |max member force| ≈(node_3 load magnitude)/n_members ≈ 34/(2,3) ≈ 11–17 making the stress per area_id ≤0.5.
