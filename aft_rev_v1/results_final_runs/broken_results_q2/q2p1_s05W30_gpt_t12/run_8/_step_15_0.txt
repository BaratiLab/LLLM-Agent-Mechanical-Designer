The current and all historical structures fail at least mass and efficiency requirements. The process must keep boundary/support/load nodes unchanged and ensure a physically valid, closed truss.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The goal is a closed, light, and efficient truss under combined load at node_3, with boundary nodes at (0, 0), (6, 0), (2, 0). Current structures massively overshoot mass (best found is 54.61 vs 30 max) or give in under high stress (historical max_stress_to_weight_ratio up to ~9). Need to combine material saving triangulation with appropriate area assignments.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The truss must bridge from pinned at node_1 (0,0) to rollers at node_2 (6,0) and node_3 (2,0), with a strong downward and horizontal load at node_3 (-15, -30). Analysis of previous structures shows that excessive member areas (area_id >=6) raise mass enormously, while attempts to minimize member area yield insufficient strength (overstressed members) especially in the long span from node_1 or node_2 to node_3 or above. The triangles must take the oblique force efficiently onto supports—primary compression in top chords/diagonals and avoiding long unbraced sections. None of the prior structures combine minimal area and triangulated paths to handle tipping/shear/flexure at low weight. Closed top v-truss or warren/bowstring design patterns have not been fully, efficiently deployed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Primary inefficiency is using thick bottom chord members instead of distributing load with top and web triangulation at minimized member areas. A triangular or bowstring ‘roof’ is likely optimal, and nodes above the base define more triangulated members, minimizing high stress in any one chord, while using lowest possible area where the stress is small—especially for the bottom row. Adding a node above node_3 (apex), the structure can accommodate the vertical load as axial force along steep triangle sides while keeping mass low. Check equilibrium with concise equations.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign with five nodes: keep given node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0). Add nodes: node_4 at (4.0, 0.0) to allow triangle subdivision, and node_5 at optimal ‘apex’ above node_3, estimated at (3.0, 2.6), such that node_3-5-1 and 3-5-4 triangles efficiently transfer load to all three base supports. Use thin base members (area_id=1 or 2, as near-zero stress), and main web/side/top chords with minimum area that ensures max_stress < total_weight*0.5. Keep all areas as low as possible; for web/roof try area_id=2 or 3, bottom members area_id=1.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "This new closed, five-node Warren/Bowstring truss gives two stacked triangles separating the main span. The load at node_3 passes to node_5 above, dispersing force into top chords and double web diagonals angled to both supports; short members reduce buckling risk. By choosing area_id=1 solely on horizontal ties where stress is minimal and area_id=2–3 only on unique diagonals/chords, both strength and mass limits should be met. Each node is structurally relevant, members close the mesh, load paths are short and direct, ensuring constraints are satisfied.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Let’s set up nodes: node_1: (0,0) – pinned, node_2: (6,0) – roller, node_3: (2,0) – roller (with load), node_4: (4,0) – divides bottom span for triangulation, node_5: (3.0,2.6) – top apex. For members: lower members: node_1–3, 3–4, 4–2, top (node_5 connects down to 1/3/4/2). Use area calculations: Length × min area-to-achieve max_stress-per-member < 0.5*mass. Estimate stresses; assign diagonal/top members a slightly larger (area_id=2) where largest share of load, lowest area (1) where possible. Calculate lengths: node_1–5/or 3–5 sqrts by pos, sum all, estimate total mass for area plan; tune node_5 heights if overshooting mass. Remove any high-area bottoms.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Key lengths: node_1–3 = 2.00, node_3–4 = 2.00, node_4–2 = 2.00, node_1–5 = sqrt(9+6.76)=~3.78, node_3–5 = sqrt(1+6.76)=~2.72, node_4–5 = sqrt(1+6.76)=~2.72, node_2–5 = sqrt(9+6.76)=~3.78. Sides 2.72, base 2. Add them: base—6.0 * 0.195=1.17 (lowest area_id, as minimal bottom stress/NS), diagonals & chords, 2.72*3+3.78*2=15.72, area 0.782 or 1.759 (area_id=2 or 3), mass estimate: say most web 2.72*3*0.782=6.37, tops 3.78*2*0.782=5.91, total mass ~1.17+6.37+5.91=13.45, well below 30. Stresses for member sharing vertical & horizontal loads in two top sides: load -30y, -15x split along two slants e.g., sqrt(2)*30/2 = 21/2 per top chord ≅10–11 per diagonal, which divided by mass/all straightforwardly yields stress-to-mass ratio under 0.5. All nodes used, no node isolated, loop is closed. Try area_id=2 for tops/webs, base as 1.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Sum mass as above, all members/lengths checked. All nodes are joined and relevant, no calculation discrepancy in connectivity. Adjust no pinned/roller or loaded node.
