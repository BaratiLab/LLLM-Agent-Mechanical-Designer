The current design\'s stress-to-weight ratio is ~1.41 (>0.5 required) and mass is ~25.5 (<30 cap). Highest stress is in member_1 (-36.1). Objective: achieve a more uniform, reduced force distribution with similar/less mass.",\n\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 is considerable, substantially vertical with moderate x. Supports at nodes_1, 2, and load application at node_3 suggest either a Warren/Howe truss or compact triangle for local efficiency. The current structure heavily relies on the (node_1-node_3) tie (member_1) that bears disproportionately high stress, suggesting insufficient triangulation or inefficient geometry and/or area use. Members from low-y to high node_4 manage both vertical shear and the mid-span moment; however, the triangulation is not well optimized, as the central member_1 remains critical. Added mass is concentrated above, e.g., member_5 is long/heavy (9 kg), central vertical. Some members such as direct chords may reroute compression tension flows more efficiently if the structure is simmer, stiffer, and nodes above supports are closer to each other. Completely avoiding long verticals and pushing node_4 higher (higher y) but inward can reduce extreme force in member_1. Mass increase budget is available (to 30kg): using smarter area assignment can deliver better stress sharing and exploit the shaping effect. Lastly, node positions and member groupings remain strictly closed, so no open ends.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "A tight, efficient truss can be made by using triangles only (no parallelogram, fewer verticals), placing a top node (like node_4) closer to load and normal to load direction (y ≈2.9..3.0, x ≈3.1..3.2). Cheap area chords, reserved mass budget for heavier diagonals. Shorten (node_1-node_3) or angle node_4 for uniform member lengths/forces. Perhaps remove one member or add an additional node to improve force flow if and only if total mass remains constrained.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign the structure: reposition node_4 to create two ~equal triangles that symmetrically distribute the load delivered at node_3 between nodes_1, 2, and node_4. Assign smallest viable cross-sectional areas to low-force chords, and larger section to diagonals. Where necessary, marginally increase y-values for upper node for more equilibrated paths and shorter high-stress bars. Six-member four-node closed arrangement is maintained, but area id is optimized for every member. Slight symmetry is preserved to offload member_1. Distances modified to keep all joints fully connected and avoid nearly vertical/ineffective member angles.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Stress is proportional to force divided by area. To keep stress-to-weight ratio under 0.5, stressed members must have higher area OR reduced force via geometry. By lifting the upper node_4 and pulling it a little toward node_3 (an efficient truss - near-equilateral triangle configuration), the load decomposes optimally for minimization of tension/compression. Assign area using available KG/m^2 according to member length and computed share of force from load direction. Leverage Savvy load path: triangle up, bowed high joints take vertical, lean supports dissipate moments/forces.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: assign area_id=4 (3.128) to loaded diagonals, area_id=2 (0.782) or 1 (0.195) to horizontal chords. Place node_4 at (3.1, 3.2) (center-ish, avoid vertical-only). For each member, length = sqrt((x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2). Mass = sum(area*len).
