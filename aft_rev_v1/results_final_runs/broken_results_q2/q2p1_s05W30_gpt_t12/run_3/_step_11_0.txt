Previous and historic designs have violated at least the stress constraint (usually ~0.93), thus a stiffer/configurationally improved solution is needed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given the downward/right load on node_3 and the fixed supports (node_1: pinned; node_2, node_3: roller), truss must effectively triangulate along and above the loaded axis. Mass can increase as long as stress-to-weight ratio stays <0.5.",\n\n    "analysis": "Historic designs are primarily 1- or 2-panel trusses, with load paths that cause high compressive/tensile members at small sections leading to high max. stress/weight (close to 1). Adding triangulation above and between supports and moving upper nodes (ex.: node_4) farther above the loaded span (y ~2.5-3.0) is not sufficient if chords are too slender; previous attempts that over-increased span height sometimes failed by under-sizing chords. Closed frames show better stability (e.g., with upper and lower connecting diagonals from node_1 to node_2 via higher rows). High-performing prior design masses: all succeed with masses well <30, but fail stress ratio. No isolated nodes in any attempts.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Previous trusses uniformly failed on stress ratio despite varying number of panels—a sign that members closest to load (most compressed/tensioned) need more area. Some diagonals help; insufficient if main load-bearing chords are undersized. Diagonals across interior panels or a Warren truss can spread load and reduce FX, maximum. Improving main member areas and smart utilization of available higher-section area_ids for loaded axis will help.",\n\n    "proposal": "To minimize stress/weight ≤0.5, reintroduce a simple, but denser and stiffer truss using 2 rows: lower-chord (supports + loaded node_3), and upper-chord with 2 panel points above (like a Warren/Pratt truss with nodes at y=0 and y~2.8, ~1.3 for interior). Diagonals criss-cross support-to-load node. Size most critical chord members (from node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2) with higher area_id. All nodes are connected. Will use area_id \'4\' (3.128) for main horizontal chords, area_id \'2\' (0.782) for diagonals or struts. Mass will remain comfortably below constraint (expected <23) due to efficient paneling.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Symmetrically above the chord, add intermediate nodes (e.g., node_4 above node_3, node_5 between node_1/node_3, node_6 between node_3/node_2, node_7 at (4.0,~1.4)). Each should enable triangles from supports through upper nodes to load. This will immensely limit member stress through triangulation (every load path splits/branches multiple). Sizing heavier area_ids for most loaded lower chord member ensures ≤0.5 ratio. Note: kept per instructions the positions of pinned (node_1) and rollers (node_2, node_3) unchanged. All nodes are wired: closed frame.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate: (a) Chords (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2) prereq size \'4\' (1.564+7.0×3.128 for 2 spans ≈ 20 units mass), remaining panels and diagonals as area_id \'2\' (max span ≈2.0ref per panel ~ 1.5 each, for 4-5 diagonals). Pratt/Warren diagonal trusses transfer load efficiently. Lower.chord: (0,0)-(2,0)-(6,0) = major force paths (use \'4\'). Diagonals: upper nodes at (1.0,1.3), (3.0,2.8), (5.0,1.3) for efficient triangulation:",\n    \n    "calculation": " 1. Lower chord: (node_1)-(node_3) and (node_3)-(node_2): L=2.0, L=4.0. Chord area used is \'4\'(A=3.128/m). Weight from these ≈(2+4)*3.128=~18.8. 2. Panel points above: place node_4 (3.0, 2.8), node_5 (1.0, 1.3), node_6 (5.0, 1.3) leads to diagonal lengths ~3.0 for tallest, ≤2.36 for sides (by Pythagoras). Diagonals assigned area \'2\'—efficient under moderate tension/compression: total diagonal member mass likely ~5.0. 3. Max member forces are limited compared to previous: paths from any node are now <2.5 units before support, splitting the load ≥twice versus prior solutions. Stiffer, and better area placement. Total mass estimated at <=24, stress-to-weight ratio well below 0.5. All nodes wired; no floating.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Nodes re-positioned only above the lower chord as allowed (load/support nodes fixed).
