The current structure and history show excessive stress-to-weight ratio (> 0.5); existing trusses are not viable. Our task is to provide, in one shot, a truss with stress-to-weight ≤ 0.5 and mass ≤ 30.0, keeping all loading & support placements fixed and ensuring all nodes are fully connected.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Supports are pinned/roller at nodes 1, 2, 3. Load acts at node_3 (-15, -30) kN (left, down). Past structures have high stress in horizontally-oriented bottom members attached to node_3. We want a closed, triangulated geometry minimizing maximum force per total mass,\n\n    "analysis": "Node_3, with the applied load, is the critical region. Glassy analysis suggests the main structural inefficiency is in almost-linear span members at the bottom, which are forced into high tension/compression by the horizontal load (-15 kN). Members attached vertically above node_3 to node_5 (~3.3 m up) or diagonally (to node_4, ~2.4 m up), provide upward force triangulation but insufficient lever-arm horizontally due to short height. Typical truss efficiency maximizes triangle heights and has short, direct load paths—relying on verticality only for local support is wasteful. Over-reinforced upper chords (extra members and/or excessive area_id=2 or 3 usage) appears in trial structures, inflating mass needlessly. Efforts to pinch mass (~21-20 kg total in both structures) keep the structure under the 30 mass limit, but do not sufficiently reduce force to achieve the ≤0.5 stress-to-weight constraint. Consequently, a stricter triangulation elevating node_5 (to increase lever-arm of top member) and focusing on optimal member sizing is needed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "High upper nodes yield better lever arms for balancing moments from loads. Past patterns overemphasized intermediate upper chords instead of an essential Warren/pratt triangle system. Removing redundant members and stringers will reduce mass and allow targeted upsizing of main load path members.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign with fewer, more direct connections—using a classic 5-node Pratt truss, but elevate node_5 higher for better moment balance. Sequence: pin at node_1 (0,0), roller nodes_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0) (with load), two high points: node_4 above node_3, node_5 above node_2 but higher than previous setups. Truss will be close, maximally triangulated—minimum total area achieves stress (area downsized where stress low, kept at 2-3 at hotspots). Remove overcomplicated diagonals and redundant chords.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Efficient trusses resolve applied load by direct members triangulated with minimal panel points; a higher top chord node height increases internal lever arms lowering individual member forces. Critical areas (nodes near/high above load/supports) will have higher area_id (\'2\', or even \'3\') as needed; less-critical panels will utilize smaller sections (\'1\'). Members between the three support nodes across the base, coupled with long diagonal struts, efficiently move both horizontal and vertical loads. Load goes from node_3 up to node_4 (vertical tension/compression); then diagonally across the span; upper nodes act in compression in top chord. This configuration capitalizes on increased moment arm and fewer, well-placed members.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Constraint equations:\\n- Stress in key member at/after node_3 loading must be reduced enough that (max(abs(stress))/(sum(member_masses))) ≤0.5\\n- Force ratio: With mass provisionally ~18-22, our stress must be <9–11 kN per this constraint. So, top member (e.g., node_3->node_5) must resist at least ~70% of Y-load, diagonals throttle X. - Each member: member_mass = A (from dict) × length- Triangle heights: Current node_5 heights (Y ~3) are insufficient; push node_5 to Y=4.8 or so (triple height for force arm), node_4 also high. Avoid unnecessary cross-bracing in upper region.",\n\n    "calculation": "1. Adjust node_4\'s (over node_3) height up slightly; increase node_5 (over node_2) to > 4.0m. Example proposal: node_4: (2,3.0), node_5: (5,4.8).\\n2. Base stays node_1: (0,0), node_2: (6,0), node_3: (2,0). \\n3. Connect: (i) ground triangle (node_1, node_2, node_3), (ii) each base to node_4 and node_5 for upper chords and compressive diagonals, (iii) node_4 to node_5 to create the final upper chord.\\n\\nMember primary force through diagonals off node_3→node_4 and node_3→node_5 (area_id=\'3\' for those two, \'2\' elsewhere). Total members: (node1-3), (node3-2), (1-4), (2-4), (3-4), (4-5), (3-5), (2-5), (1-5). By rough force distribution, with height doubled, force (stress) ~halves for same load, so now maximum member force ~7–10kN, yielding ratio < 0.5 for ~21 overall mass.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Proposed node positions extend height (particularly Y for node_5); Plan creates simple, closed, efficient Warren/Pratt-type truss triangulation with load directly under an upper node. All load/support points preserved. All triangle members connected. Check that maximum used area supports expected stress without surplus mass. Member areas placed accordingly.
