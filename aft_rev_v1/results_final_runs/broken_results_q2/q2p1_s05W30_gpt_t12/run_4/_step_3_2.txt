The existing and prior structures do not meet the stress-to-weight constraint. Objective: Find a member configuration and sizing that transfers loads efficiently, leads to low stresses, provides triangulation, and most importantly satisfies all constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three support nodes/static constraints (node_1: pinned, node_2: roller, node_3: roller, with node_3 also receiving the load), plus one interior/elevated node in prior/topology designs. All previous iterations were over constrained by stress-to-weight. All supports and the load must be preserved as per instructions.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure uses a raised node_4 (at ~[2, 2.8]) and minimal triangulation, members are oversized relative to actual load path demands, producing high stress ratios. Historical designs adding more nodes increased mass without significant ratio reduction. Members forming tall, slender triangles create inefficient force transmission, especially with significant horizontal load at node_3. The overload of member_1, with area_id=\'2\', reinforces that members near supports are too small for given loads or too long/slender. If the load path could be better triangulated and more efficient member sizing applied—with lower volume where feasible—we can likely drop both max stress and mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Overly tall geometry (node_4 too high) is suboptimal—timid use of the upper panel. Key: Keep upper nodes lower, form wider triangles, minimize span of highly-stressed members, and choose slender members away from critical links. Connected load and support (node_1, node_2, node_3, plus one apex node roughly above but closer to node_3) ensures stability. Prior node_4 positions too high, causing high compression/tension lever arms. Further, the lack of direct ties between node_2 and node_3 may allow excessive force through overstressed elements. Proposal: Slight drop and lateral move of node_4, introduce one extra panel node (node_5) closer to a low, symmetric, optimized linkage.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign: Shorten vertical panel raising node_4 and introduce a fifth node (node_5) as apex above the right midspan (e.g. x ~ 4.0, y ~ 1.2) to balance moments due to inclined load, improve triangulation, and allow for more efficient force redistribution. Connect all three main nodes (1, 2, 3) and any elevated nodes fully. Assign low areas where feasible, especially for redistribute tension diagonals and upper bucket that see less force, keeping critical lower chord members stiffer and stronger. Retain support and load node locations.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Symmetric triangles below and above the loaded span lead to redundant pathing and redundancy. A \'Warren\' (equilateral) truss pattern with optimized node elevations will enhance distribution of oblique loads. Connections from supports to both elevated nodes greatly reduce lever arms for horizontal reactions on supports, minimizing chord forces and thus lowering stress and mass. Thus, triangulating with compact geometry helps control member action. For sizing, stiffen the lowest (horizontal) chord and main diagonals; use lowest mass member areas for struts in tension or light compression. Priors wasted material far from load."),\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume area_id=\'2\' for top and verticals except main bottom chord/major compression (use area_id=\'3\'). Calculate major truss dimensions for node positions. New node_4 shifted left/down (2.8, 1.2), higher than support, directly accepts component from node_3. New apical node_5 set at (4.0, 1.2): this creates a split top triangle. Connect diagonals from both supports to both node_4/5, full connections on base. Enumerate all member lengths, assign suitable areas. Estimate load split from force angle: main share taken by right panel. The structure will include: bottom chord (node_1 - node_3 - node_2), two top \'chord\' nodes (4, 5), all diagonals fully connected. All nodes structurally connected. Total mass summing products (length × area [Table]), expect generous margin <30, but check member stresses during hand calculation logic on load path.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Nodes: node_1 (0.00, 0.00); node_2 (6.00, 0.00); node_3 (2.00, 0.00); node_4 (2.80, 1.20); node_5 (4.00, 1.20). Members: form two triangles over supports/(node_3 apex): [1-4, 3-4, 1-5, 3-5, 2-5, 3-2, 1-3, 4-5]. Summing all segment lengths: approx 2-3 units each; assign area_id=\'3\' for base/diagonal under main load (1-3, 3-2), \'2\' elsewhere including vertical/upper ties. Estimate max member loads (worst-case ~total inclined force on node_3 in members 1-3 & 3-4), expect main loaded members bear ~60-75% of load; areas provide >5x actual need for ≤0.5 stress-to-weight. Expected mass sum, using areas/lengths: under 28. For all calculations: assume optimal stress paths—major means align with force line, secondary means take light panel forces. Compact design saves mass & stress.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Verify closed triangulated structure (all five nodes connect in two main triangles and as much direct tie as needed). All nodes have some triangulated path. All donors’/supports\' coordinates and member connections preserved where strictly dictated.
