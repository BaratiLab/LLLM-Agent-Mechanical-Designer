Supports are pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 & node_3. The goal is to minimize stress-to-weight ratio while keeping total mass <= 30.0, and stress-to-weight ratio <= 0.5. Previous designs have failed by exceeding the stress-to-weight ratio, especially under high axial stress in key members.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Initial interpretation: The problem requires a single-load-point (down-and-left, node_3) bridge/truss connecting three supports (nodes 1,2,3 on the base, node_4 elevated). Given all previous attempts, including both wider layouts and denser triangulations, total mass does not violate constraints, but peak stress to weight ratio is excessive, indicating some members remain overstressed due to unfavorable geometry or inefficient load paths. Satisfying the stress constraint is the main bottleneck.",\n\n    "analysis": "Reviewing the given and historic structures: All have the load applied well to the right, yet most vertical and upper members accumulate load via extended horizontal spans and insufficient direct diagonal bracing. Member_1 (node_1-node_3) shows the highest compressive force; insufficient triangulation near the load and pin points leads to stress concentration. Previous structure expansions (more nodes, too elongated triangles) actually raised mass without reducing stress sufficiently. Key insights: Decrease the length of highly loaded members, place an additional node above the base line between node_1 and node_3, create redundant triangles, and directly tie upper nodes back to both pin supports. Members using area_id \'2\' and \'3\' still possess high axial force—indicating that geometry, not just cross-sectional area, must change.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Critical member(s) most heavily stressed are long compressive members near node_1 and node_3. Large spans without stabilizing secondary triangles or spanning nodes are the main source of constraint violation. Moving node_4 inward and upward (roughly above the centroid of base nodes), adding a midspan-top \'node_5\' connected with smaller triangles, and member size optimization can balance paths, reduce member forces, and shorten stressed links. Keeping number of nodes and total members conservative maintains mass inside the constraint, while sharply reducing stress.",\n\n    "proposal": "I will redesign the truss as a two-panel truss (Pratt or Howe-type) by inserting one new upper node (\'node_5\') above the centroid of the base support, forming compact equilateral triangles, directly tying top with all bottom members. All boundary (load/support) nodes will be untouched and original load and support assignment preserved. This will distribute both vertical and horizontal load paths via several diagonals, substantially reducing force demand per member and maximizing redundancy.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Adding a central upper node and extra triangulation will generate shorter and steeper triangles, transmitting loads from node_3 more directly to node_1 and node_2. The symmetry around the midpoint will equalize and reduce forces in each member. Using efficient triangles minimizes the force amplification seen in single-diagonal bracing; downsizing/repositioning node_4 slightly to (half span above base, lower than previous solutions) further optimizes lever arms and truss height-to-span ratio. Assign medium-small section sizes for diagonals to control mass while ensuring stress limits are safely met.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": \n    " - New node_5 placed centrally atop the span (X = (0+6)/2 = 3.00), Y = 2.30 for reasonable span:rise.\n     - node_4 updated to (2.0, 1.8) as a knee/truss-shoulder, lowering compressed span.\n     - Members configured so that horizontal base nodes (node_1, node_2, node_3) interface via large-area base members; other diagonals/sloped, shorter members can use cross-section \'2\' or \'1\' as force demands drop.\n     - Members: \n         - base beam: node_1 <-> node_2 [area \'4\'] (main chord),\n         - node_1 <-> node_3, node_3 <-> node_2 to support direct load,\n         - diagonals: node_1-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_2-node_4, long diagonals: node_1-node_5, node_2-node_5,\n         - all upper joints/node_5 insertions form stable triangles.\n     - Forces on each member estimated using method of sections/joints.\n     - Load at node_3 breaks into vertical/horizontal reaction spread between node_1 (pinned) and rollers as per statics.\n     - Chosen area_ids based on estimated internal force from geometry: shorter-heavy = \'4\', medium = \'2\', highest-stress diagonals = \'3\'.\n     - Check total mass: m = Σ(length × area weight), aiming for 28 < m < 30.\n     - check: max member force / total weight <= 0.5.",\n\n    "calculation": \n    "1.
