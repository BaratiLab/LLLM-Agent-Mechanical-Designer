The optimization goal is to reduce stress-to-weight ratio below 0.75 while maintaining mass <= 30 and ensuring nodes with supports and loads remain fixed.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given: 3 external boundary nodes with supports on nodes 1 (pinned), 2 (roller), and 3 (roller). Load is at node 3: Fx=-15, Fy=-30 units. Constraints are limiting max normalized member stress to 0.75 and total mass to <= 30. Current highest stress-to-weight ratio is above target.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure is linear on base (nodes 1,3,2 at y=0) and node 4 raised to y=3.5. Members form a fan shape, but there is no triangulated closed loop binding all nodes in a triangular manner: only one triangle (node3-node4-node1) plus extra members that do not fully triangulate or distribute loads efficiently. Under load at node 3, member_1 is highly stressed (-15.36), showing load carried mainly through node1-node3. The other members sustain very low stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "The load path heavily stresses member_1 due to uneven distribution. Better triangulation with balanced diagonals and using stronger (larger area) members on longest load path edges can reduce peak stresses. The historical ranked best design used larger cross sections 3 for diagonal members and node4 slightly resited lower to 3.0 with X=3.5, but it caused mass to nearly double (25.6 units) compared to current 14.8 mass. This is good for stress-to-weight ratio but violates mass objectives if further upscaled.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Adopt geometry near the historic rank_1 design for better triangulation: node_4 at (3.5, 3.0), keeping base nodes fixed. Use larger cross-sectional areas (area_id \'3\'=1.759) for main diagonal members leading to node_4 to strengthen load paths. Moderately size bottom members with area_id \'2\' =0.782, keeping total mass under 30. This should reduce max stress by redistributing load onto more members with increased area, improving stress-to-weight ratio below 0.75 while keeping mass within limit.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangulated structures improve rigidity and distribute loads efficiently, reducing peak member forces. Increasing cross-sectional area on main diagonal members (pods) reduces stress magnitudes. Base nodes are fixed, and node_4 repositioned slightly down balances vertical load path and shorter inclined member lengths reduce internal stress. Avoid oversizing bottom chord members to control mass. Ensuring closed truss loops provides geometric stability and satisfies problem argo rules.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: uniform material density, member force proportional to length × area. Length calculated by Euclidean distance. Stress = axial force / area, so increasing area decreases stress linearly. Total mass = sum of length × area. With area mapping: \'2\': 0.782, \'3\':1.759, the mass associated per length changes. We\'ll assign \'3\' areas to diagonal members (node1-node4, node2-node4, node3-node4), \'2\' to bottom chords (node1-node3, node3-node2). Calculate lengths of each member, then mass and approximate force path assuming load splits by stiffness proportional to area*length inverse.
