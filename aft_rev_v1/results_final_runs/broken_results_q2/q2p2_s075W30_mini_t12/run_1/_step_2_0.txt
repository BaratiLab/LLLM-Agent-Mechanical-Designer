The goal is to redesign the truss to minimize this ratio to <=0.75 and keep total mass within 30, while satisfying the static loads and boundary conditions.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 is (-15.0, -30.0). Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2 and node_3. Current design has short height (node_4 at 0.75m), possibly causing high member stresses. History shows a previous structure with node_4 at y=1.5m and higher mass but better stress ratios. Constraint on max stress/weight ratio <=0.75 is critical to reduce stresses under given load.",\n\n  "analysis": "The given load on node_3 is largely vertical downward, causing bending stresses on horizontal bottom chord members (member_1: node_1-node_2) and compression in others. The low truss height (0.75m) reduces the moment arm for vertical loads, causing large axial stresses to compensate load. The pinned and roller supports fix nodes 1 and 2 on x-axis but node_3 floating on x=2 demands triangulation for stability. The history\'s best design uses increased height (1.5m) and larger members on node_2-node_4 (area_id=4) to distribute load effectively and reduce peak stresses. Triangular shapes around loaded node_3 distribute load paths better. Current oversized three chords with low height is inefficient, causing high stresses relative to mass. Lightest cross-section (area 0.195) may cause high stresses in diagonal members. Consequently, a taller truss with appropriate triangulation and member sizing is ideal.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing node_4 height to ~1.5 roughly doubles moment arm, reducing member forces in bottom chord. Using larger cross-sectional areas for critical members, especially on loaded and support-path members, lowers stress. The member connecting node_2 to node_4 must carry the transferred load with minimal stress, area_id=4 (3.128) is a good balance. Maintain existing load and support node coordinates. Diagonalization ensuring closed triangle connectivity among node_1, node_3, node_4, and node_2 is key. Minimized mass < 30 achievable by using medium areas elsewhere and optimizing member geometry.",\n\n  "proposal": "Use the history\'s rank_1 structure as base with slight modifications: adjust node_4 vertical coordinate to approx 1.5 ensuring bigger vertical height; use members as in rank_1 connecting node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4 with area_ids from previous good configuration: larger for bottom chord (3) and diagonal (4), smaller for bracing (1). Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed as per constraints. This creates an effective closed triangulated structure with reduced stress-to-weight ratio and total mass ~29.4 < 30.",\n\n  "reasoning": "By increasing height to 1.5m, the bending moment under vertical load drops, which reduces stress in bottom chord and diagonals versus the too shallow 0.75m design. Using larger/mid area members (id 3 and 4) effectively reduces stress concentrations while balancing mass. Triangular configurations prevent mechanism and improve stability. Avoid overly large heavy cross-sections to keep under mass limit. No member is overstressed due to load redistribution over stiffer diagonals.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: material strength linearly scaled with cross-section area; total mass approx sum(length * area); stress proportional to load divided by area and member geometry; max absolute member stress < critical threshold. Calculate member lengths (Euclidean) for mass, stress estimated from member section modulus and force paths.
