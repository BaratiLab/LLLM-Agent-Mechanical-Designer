Members create a closed truss with diagonals. The generation history shows a best structure with node_4 very close at 5.00 y-level, but this increases mass beyond efficient ratio. Constraint limits: stress/weight <=0.75, total mass <=30.",\n  "analysis": "Current design uses area 6 (~7.037) for critical member_1 (node_1-node_3) carrying highest stress (-1.84). Other members area set to 1 or so. Significant portion of mass comes from member_1. Stress in member_1 is limiting factor. The member node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4 small stress, possibly overdesigned. History shows smaller areas on members had constraint violation and bigger stress. Node_4 vertical position lower than 5.1 (for example at 5.0) increases overall mass but reduces max stress improving ratio. However, mass hikes to ~23 seen in rank_1 records.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Tradeoff exists between mass increase and stress reduction. Moving node_4 downward reduces stress in key members. Area sizes like \'7\' on member_1 reduce stress but increase mass.

Reduce areas for low-stress members (member_3, member_4, member_5) from \'1\' (0.195 area) to \'0\' (1.00?? confirm from area_id given/Known?) to lower mass while meeting stresses. Retain areas of member_1 at \'6\' or \'7\' to control stress without large mass penalty. Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed due to supports/loads.",\n  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 to within 5.00 to 5.05 reduces horizontal force component and enables better load distribution. Smaller or same cross-sectional area for low stress members optimizes mass. Member_1 area \'6\' with shorter member length of ~4.47 (distance node_1-node_3) ensures acceptable stress.
