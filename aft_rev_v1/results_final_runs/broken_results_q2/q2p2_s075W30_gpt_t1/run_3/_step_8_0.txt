All constraints must be strictly satisfied, and the design should be optimal given the provided nodes and requirements.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Interpretation: The main aim is to reduce the maximum stress-to-weight ratio to ≤0.75 and the total mass to ≤30. Previous iterations either led to overstressed members or excessive mass. All loaded/support nodes are fixed and cannot be moved.",\n \n    "analysis": "Reviewing the current and previous designs: Many failures stem from high axial stress in bottom-chord members (members between supports and the loaded node), likely due to near-collinear force paths with minimal triangulation, and use of thinner (area_id \'1\', \'0\') members in highly stressed regions. Overuse of thick members increases weight but does not optimize the stress-to-weight ratio. Historic designs that use substantial members everywhere (low stress-to-weight, huge mass) fail the mass constraint. The load at node_3 is highly eccentric both vertically and horizontally, making triangulation around node_3 and efficient force distribution critical. Most prior structures are open-truss or nearly linear in the critical spans. Full triangulation and a more equilateral layout may better disperse forces. Too many nodes away from the main load path increases mass without benefit.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Pattern: Overstressed bottom chord, underutilized diagonals, skinny members in critical paths. Poor efficiency stemmed from lack of optimal member sizing per force. Maximizing triangles, especially between support and load, can resolve this. High mass in history comes from overly thick members. Low mass but failed stress ratio comes from too-thin critical members.",\n \n    "proposal": "Redesign the structure by re-positioning the two interior upper nodes (above the base supports), symmetrically to exploit triangulation. Retain all support and loaded node positions. Use only four nodes: node_1, node_2 (supports), node_3 (load+roller), and introduce two apex nodes (top center & mid-right), positioned using statics to balance vertical and horizontal force components while minimizing member lengths. Strategically assign thickest available member to the most critical (bottom chord), moderate thickness to main diagonals, and thinner for less loaded upper members. All nodes are fully connected to ensure a closed structure.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A Pratt or Warren-style truss between the three support/load nodes can resolve axial forces efficiently, especially for such a combined horizontal-vertical load. Placing upper nodes to create near-isosceles or equilateral triangles above or right-of-center allows balanced force flow. Using area_id \'2\' or \'3\' (as appropriate for the expected member stress) for heavily stressed members, and \'1\' or smaller where possible. All joints must be connected for force closure. Avoid unnecessary upper nodes far from the load/support span—this only adds mass without structural benefit. Placement of upper nodes will be based on a geometry that gives each triangle base similar length to its arms (to minimize member length and thus mass, and to divide load efficiently).",\n \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: \\n- Load at node_3 is -15 kN x, -30 kN y; support at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 (roller).\\n- Propose upper nodes at (2.5,2.0) and (4.2,1.7) to minimize member length and maximize triangulation. All supports and loads at x=0, x=2, x=6, y=0 remain. Create triangles: node_1—node_3—upper1, node_1—upper1—upper2, node_3—upper1—upper2, node_3—upper2—node_2, node_2—upper2—upper1.\\n- Assign:\\n  - area_id \'2\' (~0.782) to bottom chords (max stress)\\n  - area_id \'1\' (0.195) to diagonals\\n  - area_id \'1\' (0.195) to upper members (low stress)\\n- Triangle calculations: all triangles have member lengths near 2.3-3.5; total length ≈ 13–15m; expected mass ≈ 10–12 using these areas.\\n- Maximum member force under statics: Load is roughly split among bottom chords; diagonals/upper will see far less. Expected max stress ≈ 7–8 kN (well under previous peaks).\\n",\n \n    "calculation": "Let’s estimate:\\n- node_1–node_3: L=2m, area=0.782, mass=2×0.782=1.564\\n- node_3–upper1: L=2.1, area=0.195, mass=0.4095\\n- upper1–node_1: L=2.72, area=0.195, mass=0.530\\n- upper1–upper2: L=1.75, area=0.195, mass=0.341\\n- upper2–node_2: L=2.87, area=0.782, mass=2.244\\n- node_2–node_3: L=4m, area=0.782, mass=3.128\\n- node_3–upper2: L=1.9, area=0.195, mass=0.371\\n- upper2–upper1: L=1.75, area=0.195, mass=0.341\\n- total mass ≈ 1.564+0.4095+0.530+0.341+2.244+3.128+0.371+0.341 = 8.928 kg (well within the 30 kg limit)\\n- Estimated max member stress: Distribute load by statics, most loaded member at most ~10 kN (conservative). Per-member mass in main chords > 2.2 kg; so Max stress-to-weight ≈ 10 / 8.93 ≈ 1.12, but in reality, actual stress should be lower due to triangulation and load sharing. Using area_id \'2\' (0.782) ensures stress is further limited. Also, mass can be increased slightly in most critical chords if checks require it. To further ensure safety, I\'ll assign area_id \'3\' (1.759) for main bottom chords.",\n \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Final check: position and connect all nodes; area assignment per estimated member force; ensure triangulation; verify no isolated nodes or unnecessary redundancy.
