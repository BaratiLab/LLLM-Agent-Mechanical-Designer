The objective is to realize a fully connected closed truss that is efficient in load transfer, minimizes maximum member stress-to-weight ratio, and satisfies all constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives: all nodes with supports/loads must be retained; structure must be fully triangulated and efficiently transmit the downward and leftwards loads at node_3 into the pinned and roller supports (nodes_1, _2, _3). Starting values: best historical structure stress-to-weight ratio: 0.3351 with high mass; current and historic \'lightweight\' variants fail stress (min observed: 0.7669).",\n    \n    "analysis": "The load at node_3 is downward-and-left (-15, -30); node_1 serves as pinned, nodes_2 and _3 as rollers, requiring the load at node_3 to be effectively resolved via triangulation and direct force paths. Best structural scoring historic solution provided (rank_1) had very low stress-to-weight but mass was 28+, near the limit. Attempts to decrease mass by using smaller sections (area_id: \'1\', \'0\') have led to unacceptable maximum stresses. The current structure is quite light (mass ~10), but stress-to-weight (5.1) is much too high (e.g., member_1 sees -51.91 for just 0.39 mass). Other reconfigurations, including simple Warren or Pratt trusses, see excess in stress due to member slenderness. The load path indicates that node_3 should transmit force upward and across, thus requiring a robust direct triangular path to node_1 (pinned) and bracing to node_2 (roller) to prevent high bending.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "All \'lightweight\' trusses fail stress. Only the heavier, more robust section (area_id:\'3\', \'2\', etc.) trusses approach constraints. Mass upper bound is 30, so we have room to increase member sizes judiciously, focusing only on the most highly loaded paths. A truss with two elevated interior nodes (above line 1-2-3), with strong diagonals and verticals at node_3, should efficiently distribute force. It\'s clear that very low-mass designs overstress critical members (particularly those directly supporting node_3 or forming the lower chords). Triangulate as much as possible for rigidity.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Increase member sizes (area_id) only for the most highly-stressed members identified from prior analysis, especially those directly transferring load from node_3 to supports. Optimize node positions to maintain compact triangles. Use the configuration of historic rank_1 as the base (as it is the only structure with a feasible stress-to-weight ratio, albeit maximum allowable mass), but decrease mass slightly by moving non-essential nodes closer together and not over-sizing non-critical members. Use nodes close to (2.4,2.3) and (4.3,1.7), but attempt to lower their height modestly for shorter diagonal lengths (thus reducing member mass); prioritize area_id: 3 or 2 in high-stress members; others can use area_id:1.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Key is routing load paths efficiently: node_3 needs one strong direct member up/left to node_4 (above and between 1 and 3), one up/right toward node_5 (between 3 and 2). Diagonals to node_2 and node_1 from node_4 and node_5 provide closed triangles. Compactness reduces member length, and thus mass, while enlarged area_ids on stressed members keep local stresses in check. Members less critical for main force path may receive smaller area_ids. All node connections must be maintained for closure.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Major members: (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), (node_1-node_4), (node_4-node_3), (node_4-node_5), (node_5-node_3), (node_5-node_2), (node_4-node_2), (node_1-node_5), (node_3-node_5). Heavily load-carrying members: those connecting to node_3 and supports—these get area_id \'3\' or higher. Others (bracing, interior diagonals) use area_id \'1\'. Use geometry to reduce member length where possible (bring node_4 y to 1.9, node_5 y to 1.4). Estimating member mass as length × area; anticipate total mass around 19-22, and maximum stress below 14. Constraint: max(abs(stress))/sum(weight) ≤ 0.75. For mass, prioritize keeping high-area members short.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: anticipate (node_1-node_3)=2.00, (node_3-node_2)=4.00, (node_1-node_4)=sqrt((2.3)^2+(1.9)^2)≈2.99, (node_4-node_3)=sqrt((0.45)^2+(1.9)^2)≈1.95, (node_4-node_5)=sqrt((2.0)^2+(0.5)^2)≈2.06, (node_5-node_3)=sqrt((2.1)^2+(1.4)^2)≈2.54, (node_5-node_2)=sqrt((1.7)^2+(1.4)^2)≈2.19, (node_4-node_2)=sqrt((3.7)^2+(1.9)^2)≈4.17. For high-stress diagonals, use area_id \'3\' (1.759); for bottom chords, area_id \'2\' (0.782); for remaining, area_id \'1\' (0.195). Estimate total mass: major members * area per unit, minor * area per unit, should fit under mass budget and reduce stresses. Prior calculations suggest stress≤14 for such proportions, giving a stress-weight ratio well below 0.75.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "All nodes connected, all loads and supports preserved.
