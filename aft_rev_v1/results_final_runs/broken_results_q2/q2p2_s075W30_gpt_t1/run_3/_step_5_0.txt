Previous iterations failed to meet the stress-to-weight ratio constraint (<=0.75), indicating over-stressed or inefficient members. The objective is to deliver a closed, fully triangulated truss that minimizes the stress-to-weight ratio and total mass within constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Evaluate why previous structures fail. All stress-to-weight ratios in history are above 0.75, mainly because of overstressed members with small areas and/or poor triangulation. The latest structure (iteration 4) has a ratio of 3.77 and mass 12.46. Previous attempts with more material/members dramatically increase mass but not efficiency.",\n\n    "analysis": "The critical load is at node_3 (-15.0, -30.0), creating large vertical/shear forces and bending. Node_1 and node_2 at the base act as the support span (6m apart). All previous designs form a \'triangle with a top joint,\' but node_3 (load application) is always colinear with the supports at (2,0). Result: the members between node_1 and node_3, and node_3 and node_2, carry excessive axial force, especially if cross-section areas are minimized. The truss needs better triangulation and vertical height between load and supports for force dispersion, while keeping mass reasonable.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Members adjacent to node_3 are always critically stressed, mainly due to short distances among supports and load point (node_3 at (2,0)). Area scaling helps but makes mass explode (see constraint_not_met_1: 64 kg). The best route is to raise the loaded node (vertically offset) but that\'s prohibitedâ€”node_3 can\'t move (it carries the load). The only way to improve load paths is to use efficient triangulation: form \'deep triangles\' between the supports and the loaded node (add more nodes above the base), possibly create a Warren truss with one or two upper nodes, minimizing long slender members with high force.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign: Introduce two new upper nodes (\'node_4\' and \'node_5\') above the base (creating a polygonal truss). Connect all lower nodes (node_1, node_2, node_3) to upper nodes, using the smallest practical member areas to minimize weight, except place larger areas where force will be high. Carefully triangulate so every node participates in the load path. This layout is reminiscent of a shallow Pratt/Warren truss, which is efficient for mid-span point loads. Remove unnecessary long members and avoid redundant heavy diagonals.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Using a Warren (triangular) top chord makes for efficient force distribution: the load can spread out through short direct diagonals to both supports rather than being absorbed almost entirely by the short base ties. Upper nodes are positioned above (2,0) and between (0,0) / (6,0), enabling triangles. All members kept as short as possible, favoring triangles over non-redundant straight ties. Thin members are fine for less critical diagonals, but the main load paths (from load-applied node up to new top nodes, and across to supports) should get a medium area (to limit stress and avoid overdesign). Estimated member areas are chosen as follows: \'0.195\' for non-critical, \'0.782\' for slightly loaded, \'1.759\' or \'3.128\' only if necessary to keep mass down while controlling stress.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Key assumptions: member forces mainly axial; node_3 carries very high force due to vertical load; placing node_4 at (2,2.5) and node_5 midway up (4,1.0) creates deep triangles. Will check member lengths, assign member areas, and estimate member forces via static equilibrium and geometry. Rough estimate: max force in mid members should drop ~50%, so stress can be below constraint. Symmetry will be used for node locations and area assignments. Keep member count minimal but ensure closure. Mass is sum(length*area), using provided area values. Ensure all nodes are closed (connected).",\n\n    "calculation": "Member plan: five nodes (node_1: (0,0), node_2: (6,0), node_3: (2,0), node_4: (2,2.5), node_5: (4,1.0)). Members: triangle base (node_1-node_2, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_1), vertical/diagonal (node_3-node_4, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_4-node_5, node_1-node_5). Assign areaid \'0.782\' (area=0.782) for base members, \'1.759\' for verticals, \'0.195\' for light diagonals. Estimate all member forces: critical members now experience at most ~20kN (from splitting main vertical reaction), stress per member area for 0.782 is then ~25 MPa and mass per member low. Compute sum(length*area) using 2 decimals; keep total mass <30 kg. Confirm stress/weight <0.75.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Check all nodes are participating in the load path. Triangulation is complete, non-redundant. Area assignments should keep total mass <<30kg. Shorter members (verticals/diagonals) ensure low max stress; largest force is on node_3 to node_4 and node_1 to node_3, so use a higher area if needed. Ensure geometry is not colinear. Final member count: 9, as per closure and redundancy check. Final check: total mass, max stress reasonably under constraint limits.
