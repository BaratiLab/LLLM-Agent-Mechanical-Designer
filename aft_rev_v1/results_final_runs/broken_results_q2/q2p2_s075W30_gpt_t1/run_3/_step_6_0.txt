The main load is applied at node_3 (-15, -30), supported at nodes 1, 2, 3. The strongest member (member_1) maxes at -9.6 stress. Total mass is 28.65, safely below the 30 limit; the stress-to-weight ratio is 0.3351 (well below the 0.75 threshold). "\n        "Constraint-violating historic designs show high mass with low stress-to-weight (from large area usage) or vice versa (from minimal bracing and high stress). "\n        "Current topology is stable, but analysis of member stresses shows member_1 carries nearly all the stress, suggesting possible load-path inefficiency. Other members spread remaining loads more modestly, hinting at potential to optimize mass by tuning member placement and node locations."\n    ),\n    "scratch_pad_2": (\n        "Triangulated topologies yield efficient stress distribution but mass can sometimes be trimmed further via: (a) careful node \'nudging\', (b) switching certain members to lower area and moving nodes to reduce span, (c) eliminating excessive overlap without removing necessary bracing.
