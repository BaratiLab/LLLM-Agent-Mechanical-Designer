The optimization goal is a closed, fully connected truss with minimized mass, all while satisfying the constraints.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: minimize max(abs(stress))/total_weight and mass (<30). Previous structures all exceeded the stress-to-weight ratio, mostly due to high stresses in main span members passing through node_3 (loaded node). Each solution is triangulated but force distribution is heavily concentrated. Node/area optimization is needed without altering support/load node positions.",\n\n    "analysis": "The load (-15, -30) at node_3 is quite large and off-center, resulting in high force concentration on the lower chord. The best previous designs used five nodes and up to nine members with some attempt at triangulation, but still failed the stress-ratio constraint (min: 0.9289). High axial force in bottom members and insufficient upper bracing led to constraint violation. Increasing vertical height (y for node_4/node_5) spreads forces, and prudent choice of member areas can help. The history suggests that excessive mass is not the issue (all designs were below 30), but uneven force distribution is.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation is good, but upper node heights may be too low, causing sharp angles and high force in bottom cords. Diagonals may be under-sized or missing near critical load path. Members facing the load at node_3 (esp. node_1-node_3 & node_3-node_2) consistently see max stress. Revising vertical positions and reinforcing diagonals while not oversizing members can improve ratio.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign: Move upper nodes (node_4, node_5) higher for better load angle and force sharing. Form a near-symmetric, double-triangulated truss using an extra node (node_6) above node_3 to further distribute the vertical load. Utilize higher area for main lower chord, moderate area for verticals/diagonals. This distributes load more evenly, reducing max stress in any single member, directly targeting constraint violation.",\n\n    "reasoning": "By increasing node_4 and node_5 y-coordinates and adding node_6 above node_3, we create a strong central triangle to collect and diffuse the large vertical load at node_3. The vertical position increases lower the moment at base supports, diagonalizes force paths, and provide redundancy. Main lower chord members and diagonals are upsized where required, avoiding oversizing upper members. Triangulation ensures no long unbraced spans.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Key assumptions: - No node can be moved for pinned/roller or loaded nodes. - Member areas must be selected from the provided discrete set. Forces estimated via statics: main loaded diagonals, verticals, and lower chord will see highest stress. Approximate span: 6 units; raising the superstructure height (to ~3) should improve force distribution. Calculate total mass: sum(area*length for each member). Estimate max stress (assume load at node_3 will be split via diagonals/verticals). Aim for main diagonals at area \'3\' (1.759), base at \'2\', upper chords at \'1\' or \'0.195\' for efficiency.",\n\n    "calculation": "Raise node_4 and node_5 to y=3.0, add node_6 at (2.0, 3.5) above loaded node_3. Calculate member lengths:\n    - node_3-node_6 = 3.5\n    - node_4-node_6 and node_5-node_6 ~2.06, 2.18\n    - Chords: node_1-node_3 (2), node_3-node_2 (4), node_1-node_4 ~3.60, node_2-node_5 ~3.60, etc.\n    Members chosen:\n    - Lower chord: \'2\' (0.782)\n    - Main vertical (node_3-node_6): \'3\' (1.759)\n    - Diagonals (node_3-node_4, node_3-node_5, node_4-node_6, node_5-node_6): \'2\'\n    - Top chords: \'1\' (0.195)\n    - Side diagonals: node_1-node_5, node_2-node_4: \'1\'\n    Mass:\n    - Sum up member length × area, stay well below 30.\n    Stress distribution:\n    - Vertical at node_3 now shared by node_3-node_6, and triangulated into top and side, lowering max force in any one member, targeting max stress ~10–12 if reasonably distributed.\n    Estimated stress-to-weight: maximum member force will be ~12 with total structure mass ~11.0, giving a ratio <0.75.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints expected to be met: all nodes fully connected, main chords/diagonals well sized, node positions tuned for triangulation and efficient load paths.
