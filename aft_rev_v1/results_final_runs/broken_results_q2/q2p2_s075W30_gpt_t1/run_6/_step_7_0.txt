Prior attempts failed, and both current and historic designs violated at least one constraint. The challenge: close the truss while maximizing efficiency and adhering strictly to the constraints.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: Closed, minimal-mass truss; constraints: stress-to-weight ≤0.75, total mass ≤30. Nodes with supports/loads (nodes 1, 2, 3) must remain fixed. Triangulation, symmetric load paths, and member sizing are essential to pass constraints.",\n\n    "analysis": "The current and prior constraint-violating designs exhibit: (1) overstressed members near node_3 due to single strong load, (2) some members seeing minimal load (underutilized mass), and (3) aspect-wise inefficiency—nodes too high or too wide, creating long, heavy but weak triangles. In prior solutions, area_3 or higher is often needed on loaded bottom chords to survive the main force. Many members are oversized or underused, showing missing triangulation or redundant/unhelpful diagonals. Strong tension/compression members at the bottom chord and efficient triangle bracing from supports/load nodes are lacking.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Stress-to-weight ratios overshot in designs with cross-bracing or extended top nodes. Under-triangulated structures overload a few bottom members. The history’s lowest ratio design was \'rank_1\', but it still didn’t hit the ≤0.75 limit and had excessive mass; too many members wasted weight. The consistent issue is insufficient spread and bracing of load at node_3. To meet constraints, I must (a) keep the truss shallow and direct, (b) ensure short, triangulated members, and (c) assign area efficiently, possibly using a shallow Pratt or Warren truss, with a single midspan top node for clarity, using only essential diagonals.",\n\n    "proposal": "I propose a concise, closed 5-node truss, with two direct chords (base and shallow top), triangulation for efficient load transfer (Warren-like), and optimized cross-bracing. The top chord’s mid node will be nearly above node_3, creating strong triangles and minimal member lengths. All inactive or overloaded diagonals are eliminated. Each member will use the minimum area needed for the likely force path: largest beneath the load, smallest elsewhere. Members will connect: (node_1, node_3, node_2) as the base, a top node above node_3, and short diagonals for triangulation. This minimizes weight and stress ratio while keeping all nodes structurally connected.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Placing a top node nearly above node_3 keeps triangles shallow and short, leading to efficient force sharing. The strong load on node_3 is best resisted by a direct triangle to the top chord, with diagonals spreading load to both supports. This matches the load transfer path of a central-loaded, simply-supported truss. Symmetry and minimal member count reduce mass and avoid underused elements. The loaded bottom chord needs a bigger cross section; the rest remain light. The proposed geometry is a classical, shallow, 5-node, Warren truss, with optimized proportion to meet the constraints exactly.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Area selection: bottom chord under node_3 likely needs area_3 (1.759) or area_4 (3.128); diagonals/upper chord may be area_1 or area_2. \nMass = Σ(length × area). \nEstimate member forces using statics—mainly axial (tension/compression) for diagonals/base; top node will reduce peak stress on middle bottom member (beneath node_3). \nNodes: \n- node_1: (0.00, 0.00) – pinned\n- node_2: (6.00, 0.00) – roller\n- node_3: (2.00, 0.00) – loaded node (force at -X, -Y)\n- node_4: (3.00, 1.60) – top center, above node_3 for even triangles\n- node_5: (6.00, 1.60) – top right, helps diagonalize right-hand triangle\nMember connections:\n- bottom chord: node_1–node_3–node_2\n- left & right triangulation: node_1–node_4, node_2–node_4, node_3–node_4\n- right top: node_2–node_5, node_4–node_5, node_3–node_5", \n\n    "calculation": "Lengths: (node_1,node_3): 2.00m; (node_3,node_2):4.00m; base total = 6.00m.
