The current structure is under-constrained (stress-to-weight ratio = 0.8957 > 0.75) despite a low total mass (16.46 < 30), mainly due to high localized stresses. The task is to preserve support/load placements while restoring constraint adherence, using closed triangulation.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "The structure must support a significant (-15, -30) load at node_3, with pinned and roller supports at nodes_1/2/3. Node positions for supports/loads must be unchanged; only interior layout and connectivity can be optimized. Constraints: stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 0.75, total mass ≤ 30, use only provided cross-section area IDs, and guarantee no isolated nodes.",\n    "analysis": "Examining the history, historic rank_1 structure is over-built (heavy, but compliant on ratio), current design is lighter but overstressed at certain chords. Most failures arise from excessive stress focusing at node_3 (where the large load is applied), resulting in high compression/tension in immediate members. Lighter trusses become overstressed, while heavier ones waste mass in under-stressed members. Historical patterns show that increasing triangulation around node_3 and midspan, while using intermediate area sizes, helps distribute load more efficiently. Removing members or overshrinking areas to cut mass overshoots the stress bound. A balanced, carefully triangulated, diamond-shaped Warren truss (with a central vertical at loaded node_3) is likely optimal. I note that node_4/5 in current and prior designs are somewhat inefficiently placed (off the centroid of the span), failing to maximize triangulation or minimize force eccentricity.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "The most overstressed members are the ones directly linking node_1 and node_3. Direct compression/tension routes from node_3 to nodes_1 and _2 are too short; this can be eased by introducing an additional node above node_3 in the vertical plane (forming a diamond), and ensuring it is well-connected with triangulation to supports and adjacent span nodes. The improved efficiency will help lower stress in the loaded members. Moving high members closer to the midspan and maintaining symmetry may increase redundancy and smooth force flow.",\n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss as a closed diamond/Warren-type truss. Keep node_1 ([0.0,0.0]), node_2 ([6.0,0.0]), and node_3 ([2.0,0.0]) fixed. Add two elevated nodes on either side of node_3, forming a central triangle/diamond, plus a node above node_3 (node_6), well braced. Connect all via triangulation so all panels are trusses, especially under the loaded node. Select member areas based on anticipated internal force: use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for members likely to carry high force, \'1\' (0.195) for diagonals/verticals with lower stress, and minimal \'3\' (1.759) where compression is likely severe and buckling is a risk.",\n    "reasoning": "The closed Warren truss achieves efficient load transfer. The concentrated downward load at node_3 will be spread not just to nodes_1 and 2, but also through the new elevated nodes to midspan and supports, forming two or more efficient load paths. Proper geometry (approximate symmetry, adequate height, and panel width) minimizes both maximum force and member lengths, thus reducing mass while preventing over-stresses. Intermediate diagonals mitigate stress peaks and further distribute forces.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Load is mainly vertical at node_3, secondarily with a small horizontal component. Supports resist resultant forces. All nodes connected with at least two independent paths. Set node_4 at (2.0, 2.3) directly above node_3 (maximizes vertical triangulation). Set node_5 at (1.0, 1.3) (left of center), and node_6 at (3.0, 1.3) (right of center) for optimal triangulation. Connect node_4 to all base and elevated nodes. Use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for bottom chords/supports, \'3\' (1.759) for direct verticals/loads (node_3 to node_4), and \'1\' (0.195) for less critical diagonals. Mass is estimated by member length × area for each, summing all.",\n    "calculation": "Member length estimates: node_3<->node_4 = 2.3 ; node_4<->node_5 ≈1.42; node_4<->node_6 ≈1.42; base chords = 2.0, 4.0; major diagonals ≈2.41. Choose minimal but safe areas. Anticipate that central vertical (node_3-node_4) carries roughly half load; assign area_id \'3\' for buckling safety. Diagonals share remaining load; assign area_id \'2\' to the long diagonals formed from node_3 to node_5/6, node_4 to nodes_1/2, base chords use area_id \'2\'. Calculate total mass as sum(length × area). Check max stress by force balance; expect all ≤0.75×mass.",\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Double-check: All nodes connected, no isolated joints. All cross-section area IDs valid. Estimated max stress/weight ≈0.70 (target <0.75). Total mass under 20 (target <30). Resulting structure is a closed truss, well-distributed, tighter geometry at midspan for load flow, using prior high-score results as design hints but improving geometry for optimal load distribution and compliance.",\n    "node_dict": {\n        "node_1": (0.00, 0.00),      # Pinned support, base, fixed.
