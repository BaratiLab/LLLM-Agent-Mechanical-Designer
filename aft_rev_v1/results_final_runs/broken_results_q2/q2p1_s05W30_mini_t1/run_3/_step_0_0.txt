Loads at node_3 downward-left at ~30° and magnitude 15. Supports at node_1 pinned and nodes 2 and 3 rollers. Objective to create closed truss with limited total mass <=30 and stress-to-weight ratio <=0.5. Initial setup suggests need for triangulation to resist lateral load components and maintain stiffness.",\n\n  "analysis": "Nodes on a straight line reduce stability; vertical and inclined members needed to resolve horizontal load components from node_3\'s inclined load. Node_1 pinned provides full restraint, node_2 and node_3 rollers allow vertical or horizontal translation but limited reactions; structure must be self-stable. Maximum stress expected in members near the load (node_3). Member cross-section area choices critical for balancing weight and strength. Use existing nodes plus one intermediate node above node_3 to form a triangular truss. The load applied at node_3 with components Fx = -15*cos30 ≈ -12.99, Fy = -15*sin30 = -7.5."\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Assign a new node (node_4) above node_3 to form a triangle with node_1 and node_2. This triangle helps distribute the load via two inclined members from node_4 to node_1 and node_2 and a vertical member from node_3 to node_4. This configuration helps prevent bending stresses and spreads load efficiently into supports. Choose smaller areas for longer members to save weight and larger areas for high-force members near the load.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Introducing node_4 at (2.0,2.5) above node_3 (vertical offset; choose 2.5m for structural height to stabilize load). Members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, and base chord nodes node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, and node_1-node_2. Triangulated closed truss with two triangles sharing node_4 centralizes load transfer and reduces maximum stress. Base chord members sized with smaller areas since mainly axial load; members connected to node_4 sized larger to carry higher forces.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_4 length = sqrt((2-0)^2 + (2.5-0)^2) = sqrt(4 + 6.25) = 2.915. node_2-node_4 = sqrt((6-2)^2 + (2.5-0)^2) = sqrt(16 + 6.25) = 4.72. node_3-node_4 = 2.5 (vertical). node_1-node_3 = 2.0. node_3-node_2 = 4.0. node_1-node_2 = 6.0. Assign cross-sectional areas: node_1-node_3 area_id \'1\' (0.195), node_3-node_2 area_id \'1\' (0.195), node_1-node_2 area_id \'0\' (1.0) - base chord larger for stability, node_1-node_4 area_id \'6\' (7.037), node_2-node_4 area_id \'6\' (7.037), node_3-node_4 area_id \'4\' (3.128) for triangular members. Check mass and stress via equilibrium and axial load assumption. Use static equilibrium in x and y for forces in members and ensure stress-to-weight <=0.5. Density assumed unity for simplicity.",\n\n  "calculation": "Member masses (length * area): m1=2*0.195=0.39, m2=4*0.195=0.78, m3=6*1=6, m4=2.915*7.037=20.5, m5=4.72*7.037=33.2, m6=2.5*3.128=7.82. Total mass=0.39+0.78+6+20.5+33.2+7.82=68.69, which exceeds 30 max. To reduce mass: reduce areas on heavy members. For node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4, reduce to area_id \'3\' (1.759): masses = 2.915*1.759=5.13, 4.72*1.759=8.3. node_3-node_4 reduces to \'1\' area (0.195): 2.5*0.195=0.488. New total mass=0.39+0.78+6+5.13+8.3+0.488=21.1 <=30. Calculate forces: Approximate axial force in base chord (node_1-node_2) due to node_3\'s horizontal load resolved by triangle. Members node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4 carry compression/tension approx equal to horizontal load components (~13N each) with reduced area 1.759 providing stresses around 7.4 (force/area) which is acceptable for structural units used. Maximum stress assumed in node_1-node_2 member given load transfer estimations: force ~15N, area 1, stress=15. Stress-to-weight ratio=15/21.1=0.71 > 0.5, so increase area of base chord (node_1-node_2) to \'3\' (1.759): mass = 6*1.759=10.55 total mass =25.65 stress=15/1.759=8.53 improved but still high. Increase area to \'4\' (3.128): mass=6*3.128=18.77 total mass=33.87 >30, violation. Choose intermediate area \'2\' (0.782): mass=6*0.782=4.692 total=19.83 stress=15/0.782=19.19 too high stress. Use area \'3\' (1.759) and slightly reduce areas on node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4 to \'2\'(0.782) giving masses: 2.915*0.782=2.28, 4.72*0.782=3.69 total mass ~ 10.55 + 2.28 + 3.69 + 0.488 + 0.39 + 0.78=18.7 very good. Stress max at node_1-node_2 = 15/1.759=8.53, stress-to-weight ratio =8.53/18.7=0.456 < 0.5 meets constraint. Final design feasible.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Design with four nodes (node_1, node_2, node_3, new node_4 at (2.0,2.5)).
