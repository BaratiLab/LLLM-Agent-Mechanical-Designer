Objective is to redesign a fully triangulated 2D truss satisfying support, load, and weight constraints with improved load path and optimized member sizing.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The load is a concentrated negative force on node_3 with three supports at nodes 1,2,3. Current members form a somewhat open truss but member stresses are unbalanced, causing high stress-to-weight ratio. History shows denser members help reduce stress but increase mass above limit.",\n    \n    "analysis": "1. The load at node_3 downward-right puts members connected to it in high axial stress. Members in the horizontal span (node_1 to node_2) under loaded are lightly sized but quite long, causing inefficient force distribution. 2. Support at node_1 (pinned) and roller at nodes 2 & 3 imply vertical reaction at 2 and 3 only prevents vertical translation, the structure must stabilize efficiently with full triangulation. 3. Node_4 displaced off the line connecting lower nodes is meant to enable a triangular cage to spread load. Current member areas fail to balance deformation and stress induced by non-symmetric actuator force. 4. History shows adding diagonal members improves load transfer but mass grows excessively or stress-to-weight remains too high. 5. Larger cross section members near loaded nodes and shorter diagonals may reduce peak stress and keep total mass <30",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "A more symmetric node arrangement and precise full triangulation can improve load paths. Node_4 slightly shifted for valid triangulation but must consider constraints around fixed nodes. Limiting cross-sectional areas to moderate values and using members emphasizing shorter lengths will limit mass and stress levels. Including node_3 as neither moved nor support-relocated respects constraints.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Retain supports and loaded nodes fixed. Retain nodes 1,2 at base fixed. Move node_4 left close to node_3 to create more equilateral triangles optimizing force distribution. Use a fully connected closed triangular truss of 4 nodes (triangle around 1-3-4 and 2-3-4 plus base 1-2). Size members in area_id={\'1\',\'2\',\'3\'} to balance stress and mass. Cut unnecessary base diagonal member or set smallest area. This redesign improves triangulation and reduces stress concentration at loading node_3.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation avoids zero-force members and buckling issues. A near-equilateral triangle shape (base width ~4 units, vertical height ~3 units) centered about node_3 allows stiffness increase nearby loading to distribute load evenly. Large cross-sectional areas near node_3 absorbs high load; smaller ones for horizontal members reduce mass. Load acts downward-right on node_3: a support at node_2 with reduced area suffices to supply reaction reducing bending moments in base members. Horizontal members sized appropriately to transmit only portion of the axial force. Roller supports at node_2 and node_3 allow for vertical base flexibility ensuring statics solvable. Avoid overload on member_1 connecting node_1 to node_3 with slightly smaller area to reduce mass balance.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Key assumptions: Uniform steel density; Length by Euclidean distance; member force linear with applied load scaled by area. Mass = Sum(member length * area). Estimate max axial stress proportional to load / area. Use approximate lengths: base (~4 m), height (~3 m), diagonals (~3.6 to 5 m). Area choices 0.195, 0.782, 1.759 reduce stress-to-weight ratio if used wisely. Estimates: max stress for areas 1.759 or 0.782 will be less than previous 46.69 yielding stress-to-weight ratio <0.5. Verify total mass not to exceed 30; use symmetry and member sizing to predict weighted mass approx 15-20 but optimize to near 15.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (4.0, 0.0), node_3 (2.0, 0.0), node_4 (2.75, 3.0).
