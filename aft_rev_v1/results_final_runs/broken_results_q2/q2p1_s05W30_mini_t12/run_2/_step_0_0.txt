Load (-15,-30) acts at node_3 downward-left. Supports: node_1 pinned (restrains both x,y), node_2 roller (restrains vertical y only). We must form a stable closed truss, typically a triangle. Current nodes are in a line, so a single triangle connecting the nodes won\'t enclose area. We need an additional node off the line to form a closed, triangulated structure.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Because all nodes are on the x-axis, these three form a degenerate triangle (zero area). To resist the vertical load on node_3, truss must have vertical stiffness and stable triangulation. A typical approach is to add one node above the line (between node_1 and node_2) to form a robust triangle. Members must provide axial forces resisting load in directions while minimizing weight. Expected load paths: vertical load at node_3 shared by member forces in adjacent members to node_1, node_2, and the new node. The supports: node_1 pinned can resist horizontal and vertical reactions; node_2 roller only vertical. No horizontal reaction at node_2, so horizontal equilibrium depends on node_1 and link geometry. Failure modes: buckling of compression members under vertical load, tension in diagonal members. Least weight members for compressing loads.</br> Add minimal nodes with appropriate members to keep total mass low while achieving stress lower than stress limit tied with total mass. Use area_ids for variable cross-sections to control weight. Avoid large cross-sectional areas unless stress demands it. Mass calculated as sum(lengths * area factor), with area_ids trigo on stress sizing.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "From analysis, the key fix is an additional node above line (between node_1 and node_2). Reasonable y-height around 3-4 units (half or two-thirds span) to develop truss depth, minimizing member length but adding stability. New node placed at x=3 (midpoint between node_1 and node_2), y=3. Create members connecting node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-new_node, new_node-node_2, node_3-new_node. This forms a closed pentagon with triangulation including node_3. With these members, internal forces shared. Select cross-sectional areas to minimize stress-to-weight ratio within constraints. Anticipate primary load on node_3 acting downward-left causing tension in diagonal members connecting node_3 to nodes_1 and 2, compression in vertical/horizontal. Chose area_ids to balance stress and mass: small areas (0.782 or 1), moderate (3.128) for more loaded members. Simplify design by using small or mid-size areas. Assume density proportional to area factor given. Confirm total mass under 30, maximum stress-to-weight ratio below 0.5.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Triangulated closed truss with the added node should provide static determinacy and stability. The midpoint above line creates joint height to transform vertical load into axial forces. Members designed mostly in tension or compression, minimizing bending. Loads applied as downward-left (vector), so diagonal members carry tension. Symmetry suggests uniform area ids might not minimize mass—select cross section area per force magnitude. Use static equilibrium to solve member forces: sum vertical and horizontal components for node_3 (load applied) and supports, find member forces, then select area to ensure max stress/weight ratio ≤0.5. Keep total weight <30 by choosing area_ids tightly.

Since magnitude is -15, interpreted as -15N at -30 deg from horizontal means load components are (assuming load vector direction to x,y axes: Fx = -15×cos(30°)= -15×0.866= -13 approx left, Fy = -15×sin(30°)= -15×0.5= -7.5 downward).
