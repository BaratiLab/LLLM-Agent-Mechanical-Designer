Nodes 1 and 2 are base support with 0 y-coordinate at 0.0. Node_4 forms the top apex. Members form a closed quadrilateral with one diagonal (member_5). The 3.0, 1.81 apex results in moderate vertical height affecting member length and thus mass. Stress pattern shows largest compressive stress in member_1 connecting fixed node_1 to loaded node_3, is closely matched by other members supporting top node_4. Member_5 transferred negligible stress with larger cross section area than predecessor states. The history shows last best lower ratio achieved by increasing area on member_5 from \'4\' to \'5\' but increased mass beyond 27, worsening ratio alone. Smaller area in members near supports may be limiting stress distribution efficiency. Some histories suggest node_4 height at ~1.8 is effective; going beyond causes constraint violation.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "From history best solutions scored =0.409 involve raising node_4 to 1.80 or slightly less bottom node_3 fixed at x=2.0, y=0.0; member_5 area increased to \'5\' (4.887). The tradeoff of minor height change and increased diagonal cross-sectional area appears to optimize stress distribution and mass. The rest area assignments kept mostly \'2\' or \'3\' allowed structurally. Given node_3, 2.0,0 fixed, minimal reposition of node_4 or area ID seems optimal. Adjust member areas on primary tension/compression members rationally might further reduce max-stress ratio without raising mass above 30.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Propose to adopt the rank_1/rank_2 structure with node_4 at (3.0, 1.80), areas for baseline members similar, but refine area_ID assignment: area \'5\' for member_5 as diagonal, area \'3\' for vertical members, and \'2\' for base members to balance weight with improved stress distributions. Maintain node locations of supports and loads fixed. This yielded best score (~0.409), lower than current 0.4794. Will verify stress and mass computationally.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Selected nodes preservation is essential due to loads/supports fixing. Structural symmetry promises balanced load path. Increasing member_5 area to 5 effectively reduces stress at the diagonal, a key load-bearing member. Areas \'2\' and \'3\' are respective for top chord and bottom chord balancing weight efficiency. The apex height 1.8 optimizes internal force distribution near peak load point. Rational gradation of member areas is key to lightweight but strong design. Tetriangulation achieved with 5 members with a single diagonal keeps the structure closed and statically determinate. Load directly transferred from node_3 by members_1,3,5. Node_2 roller support and node_1 pinned boundary conditions avoid excessive degrees of freedom altering stress paths.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic behavior, uniform member cross-section over length, member mass = length × area (from table) assuming unit density or uniform. Estimate member lengths between nodes using Euclidean distance, multiply by cross-sectional area selected, sum gives mass. Max stress estimated from action forces scaled by area, assume safety factor embedded within area selection. Target updated ratio <0.5 verifying max(abs(stress))/mass <= 0.5. Cross verify with member stress history from previous close optimum ensuring the slight area increase lowers max stress insufficiently but keeps mass within limits.",\n    \n    "\\"calculation\\"": "Node distances: node_1 to node_3 = 2.0m, node_3 to node_2 = 4.0m, node_1 to node_4 = sqrt((3-0)^2+(1.8-0)^2)=3.54m, node_4 to node_2 = sqrt((6-3)^2+(0-1.8)^2)=3.54m, node_4 to node_3 = sqrt((3-2)^2+(1.8-0)^2)=2.06m.
