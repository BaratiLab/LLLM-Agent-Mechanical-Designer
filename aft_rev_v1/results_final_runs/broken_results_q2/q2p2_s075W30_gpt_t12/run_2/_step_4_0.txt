The main goal is to generate a fully constrained-cross-braced truss with lowest feasible stress-to-weight ratio and total mass under 30, given all loads and boundary conditions, while preserving imposed conditions at loaded and supported nodes.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs summarize a three-node trapezoidal truss with one additional apex node, subject to a force at node_3. All recent trials exceed the target stress-to-weight ratio and oscillating masses. The optimal structure must minimize member forces (triangulation, effective load routing), utilize lightest member areas sufficient for strength, and avoid large moment arms or bending modes.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current and historic designs concentrate span and height in excess around node_3, creating high axial stress in certain members and inadvertent weak-load path members. Past trusses either yielded high stress ratios at reasonable mass, or very heavy overengineered forms with lower ratio but mass exceeding constraints. The inefficiencies stemmed from overly long members (causing excessive load/buckling), insufficient triangulation to distribute point forces, or poorly positioned internal nodes directing force inefficiently.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The truss should resolve node_3 load to supports via direct, triangulated paths, utilizing an internal apex aligned towards the load vector with minimized height. Under heavy downward-and-left force at node_3, equally robust, direct load paths to both supports are key. Tall or off-center internal nodes distribute moment inefficiently. Two sub-triangles spanning between 0-6 horizontally plus a single central upper node offer best distribution.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign truss with four main nodes: retain node_1, node_2, node_3 at fixed locations, introduce a new apex node_4 vertically above node_3 and closer towards midspan (optimized for direct triangulation and load path efficiency). Six members: node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4 (vertical diagonal), and node_1-node_2. Select area ids to hold stress under constraints and minimize weight — using mid-level area IDs only as needed.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Key optimization uses minimal tall apex to provide efficient upward resisting force at node_3. Triangulated forms minimize bending, focusing loads along compression/tension truss members. Light, symmetric base members (node_1-node_2), direct diagonals, and slightly steeper apex harnesses load vector, optimizing force paths. Chosen node heights/positions/classes based on vector sum solution to minimize both member force magnitudes and lengths, driving ratio under constraint.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume:\n        - Nodes 1,2,3 fixed (must not change due to supports & load), node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0). \n        - Place node_4 at (3.1, 1.5): just right and above node_3 to provide efficient path based on (15,30) load angle.
