The starting design and history all violate the stress-to-weight ratio constraint (~3.2–4.5 >> 0.75), so an improved, feasible structure is required.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Initial structure has two constraints breached: (a) Maximum stress-to-mass ratio is ~4 times the allowable, and (b) Members take localized loads rather than balanced, symmetrical load paths. Structure is not utilizing the height and may be over-weighted in certain redundancy. Task is to rebalance and minimize force concentration while distributing loads efficiently.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current truss only slightly elevates loads from supports to top node_4. Stress is excessive in members between supports and the loaded node, due to short, almost-collinear base and insufficient triangulation. Historic designs\' deficiencies indicate poor vertical load transfer. Large top chord (node_4 placement above base line) is required to reduce span forces and increase triangulation angle, lowering member loads. Lighter yet structural-efficient profiles (~\'2\' or \'3\') instead of both heavier and very thin chords will help comply with mass constraint. A closed topology, likely a Warren truss shape utilizing 4 nodes, adequately braced for force transfer, should lower both stresses and total weight.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Issue: Flat geometry propagates higher force in base members (node_1 ↔ node_3 ↔ node_2). Single top node is too low (2.2 for 6-wide span), resulting in shallow triangles and magnified chord loads. Lighter diagonal and verticals with higher top chord/height will lead to smaller forces by splitting the loaded span, increasing internal member angles.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign node_4 position to give better leverage (higher y), reducing max stress. Introduce a diagonal making two interconnected triangles, ensuring all nodes participate structurally and force paths remain succinct. Assign minimized member areas for weight without overstressing small members; favor area_id \'2\' (`A=0.782`), increase upwards if member stress is high. Adjust node_4 position (target y ≈ 3.2, x ≈ 3.0) to balance load transfer efficiency and member length.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "An equilateral/trussed configuration yields smallest extremes in internal forces. Vertical projection from loaded node (node_3) to top node assists in gravity load dissipation neutrally to support nodes (node_1, node_2, node_3 roller) while utilizing truss depth to keep forces and cross-sections sized down. Avoiding excessive flatness or "Y" layouts which spike stress via small member leverage. Optimize by shifting node_4 about (x=3.0, y=3.2) for wider angles; all members use efficient cross-sections.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Area_ids: test area=\'2\' for diagonals/verticals, only increase cross-section above \'2\' if stress is too high. Truss: Members connecting node_1↔node_4, node_2↔node_4, node_3↔node_4, node_1↔node_3, node_2↔node_3, and bottom chord node_1↔node_2 -- i.e., closed, well-supported, with primary verticals and redundant bottom chord for stability. For mass, need [L_total]*area_density ≤ 30. Compute member forces (estimate as f_max_from_Q = Q/(height)) and resulting masses. Use span 6m, height_up_to_~3.2m, base 0-6, loaded at 2.0.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1(0.00,0.0), node_2(6.0,0.0), node_3(2.0,0.0), node_4(3.0,3.2). Truss configuration: All supports/nodes connected via adequate triangulation. Member lengths [rounded]: (node_1,node_3) 2.00; (node_3,node_2) 4.00; (node_1,node_4) 3.98; (node_2,node_4) 3.98; (node_3,node_4) 2.16; (node_1,node_2) 6.00. Mass ≈ Sum(length*area), for all area_id \'2\', total_mass ≈ (2+4+3.98+3.98+2.16+6)*0.782 ≈ 16.8 < 30. Since previous highest member stress at moderate areas was ~-40MPa, but truss depth just increased by ~40%, estimate new max force at ~-25MPa, thus stress-to-mass ratio ~1.5. Slight risk of overcons while mass is still far below limit; increase area of the most loaded vertical to area_id \'3\' for margin. Members: assign vertical (node_3<->node_4): area_id \'3\' (for strong load uptake), all else area_id \'2\'.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Design now preserves all support and load node constraints.
