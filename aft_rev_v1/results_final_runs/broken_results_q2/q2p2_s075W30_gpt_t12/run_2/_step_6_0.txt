The structure must remain within mass and stress-to-weight constraints while staying a closed system.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Initial interpretation: Most prior feasible structures resemble the basic trapezoidal/triangular geometry, retaining nodes fixed by supports/load. Mass use so far is efficient but further reduction needs balancing mass spread (distribution), localized high stresses in diagonal or top chords, and triangular efficiency. Structure must remain closed. Fine adjustments in node_5 position and thickness selection are likely best.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current best feasible design (\'rank_2\': score 0.5841, mass 21.98) is an efficient, closed quadrilateral with a slightly inward and lower-situated node_5 (3.2, 3.1 with all area_2 or 3 members, and connections covering the full truss). Comparing to \'rank_1\' (lower stress/weight 0.4771) with node_5 at (3.0, 3.3) but much heavier mass (27.15), and prior designs either violate constraints or overweight/stress. The main load at node_3 creates high negative stress in member_1. Node_5 location (height and x offset) impacts the length and efficiency of diagonals and top chord. Member_5 (node_3-node_5) often carries notable stress (approx range from 0.5 to 1.5), so reducing its length/config is useful. Prior attempts to distribute with a fifth node or more connections hit mass and closure problems. Area selection for top and diagonals can possibly be reduced if justified by load path mitigating peak stress.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Both sufficient strength and minimum mass require high triangularity between supports and load, minimal area in low-stress members, and careful migration of peak stress away from a single member. Currently, the layout is close to minimum. Moving node_5 slightly further left (to decrease moiety of moment arm) or higher might balance stresses more efficiently. Slight tweak in member_5 thickness. The overall symmetry and closure of the structure must be maintained as per loading and supports; do not introduce more nodes as it increases weight with diminishing returns.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Optimize current design by fine-tuning node_5\'s position: Move node_5 (currently at (3.2, 3.1)) slightly to the left and slightly up (e.g., (3.0, 3.3)), as inspired by the lower stress-to-weight in \'rank_1\', but with nearly optimal member area choices from rank_2. Then, rationalize member_5\'s area upward for the higher force path, and minimize or slightly decrease top chords\' (member_3 and member_4) area as reasonable. Ensure no mass increases while shifting load distribution for lower stress-to-weight. DO NOT change core geometry or add new nodes/members.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Symmetry and efficient triangulation demand keeping node_5 centered between the supports, but height must be maximized for leverage while controlling member length for lower mass. The top rolled chords are structurally less loaded, so can accept a slightly reduced area compared to diagonals and lower/front/back chords. Past results show same number of members with node_5 at (3.0, 3.3) lowers peak stress, albeit impacting mass. Thus, locate node_5 between (3.1, 3.2), (3.2, 3.3), keep area up for member_5 and reduce area for upper chords prudently, ensuring closure. Check stress in all key members, reduce unneeded mass in least loaded members, all while not exceeding max(0.75 stress-to-weight) nor 30 mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Work out estimated member lengths via geometry:\n - node_1: (0.0,0.0), node_2: (6.0,0.0), node_3: (2.0, 0.0), node_5: (propose) (3.1,3.2)\n - lengths: \n   member_1 (node_1-node_3): 2.00,\n   member_2 (node_3-node_2): 4.00,\n   member_3 (node_1-node_5): sqrt((3.1-0)^2 + (3.2-0)^2) ≈ 4.47,\n   member_4 (node_5-node_2): sqrt((6.0-3.1)^2 +(0 - 3.2)^2) ≈ 4.37,\n   member_5 (node_3-node_5): sqrt((3.1-2.0)^2 +(3.2-0)^2) ≈ 3.39,\n   member_6 (node_1-node_2): 6.0.\nLet diagonals (member 3,4), lower chords (m1,2,6), and main brace (member_5) each get justified area selection.\nFor mass: sum(length * area) across all.\n For stress: Major stress occurs at member_1 and member_5.
