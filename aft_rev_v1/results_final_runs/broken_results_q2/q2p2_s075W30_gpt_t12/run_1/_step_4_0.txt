Prior iterations produced structures exceeding either mass or stress-to-weight constraints. Objective: generate a closed truss that strictly satisfies the given stress-to-weight ratio (≤0.75) and mass (≤30) constraints without altering load/support nodes.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given forces and supports require efficient force paths and member utilization, using only eligible cross-sectional area choices. Structure must be closed (fully triangulated), leverage triangulation to control member forces, no isolated nodes. Existing and historic designs are over-stressed, suggesting need for better force path alignment or (possibly) light increase in overall mass.",\n    "analysis": "\\"Current designs strongly over-stress a few critical members (up to |55.9|), indicating inefficient member sizing and force path misalignment from load introduction at node_3. None of the previous nodes01-node06 designs satisfies stress/mass ratio (<0.75). The majority allocate high mass to connectors not providing significant triangulation. Notably, member_1 in most layouts is vastly overstressed (long span + minimal area). Historic \'minimal mass\' designs utilize insufficient areas at critical locations: all select id \'1\', which is the lowest area (0.195); these invariably create stress > 3x target ratio.\\" Abundant roller/pinned supports offer the ability to admit strong ‘fan’ triangulation if nodes are placed to intercept and re-distribute the external load. Current members geometry has diagonal length (long and highly loaded), while off-plane top/bottom chords could directly collect the vertical load.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Observations: historic use of excessively thin (area_1) members caused localized stress spikes; major loads travel nearly horizontal paths, increasing member_1\'s (node_1-node_3) tension/compression demand. Use of a single top chord node (node_4 or node_5) fails to solve triangulation, sometimes requiring unnecessarily massive diagonals. Guideline: reinforce out-of-plane (y>0) triangles atop the lower bases. Place a connecting top node to collect load ‘force fan’, split the main span.",\n    "proposal": "Redesign to introduce a high apex/top node (node_4), enable triangular direct load flow from node_3 to nodes_1, _2 by adding top chords and minimizing heavily stressed span members. Reduce length of extreme members from node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2 by moving node_4 up and aligned over node_3, linking both nodes_1 and _2. Use larger area_id members for the main verticals/diagonals carrying the main force. Select lighter members for others. Remove member inefficiencies—close triangles to eliminate ‘bypass’ overstressed members. Result: a classic symmetrical Pratt/Warren variant truss capturing loads efficiently, with each panel braced.",\n    "reasoning": "Symmetry and triangulation reduce stress concentration. By moving node_4 up (vertically above node_3), nearly all load paths align direct to supports. Connecting node_3 vertically with high-strength members to node_4 drives vertical force efficiently upwards—which, with diagonal bracing back to supports, splits the total load smoothly. Use area_id \'3\' where force is estimated high, area_id \'1\' for others. Approximate geometry: nodes_1[0,0], node_2[6,0], node_3[2,0] (load and roller), node_4[3,2.50] (apex above/between supports). Additional triangulating node(s) (optional) could be introduced at mid-segment for further bracing.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Key Assumptions: Members vertically above/adjacent to node_3 see highest axial loads; diagonals absorb major force split under input forces (-15,-30) kN; Supports (node_1 pinned, node_2 and _3 Hollywood rollers). Areas: area_id \'3\' (1.759) gm/cm^2 for critical verticals/help diagonals, \'1\' (0.195) for horizontals and short bracing. Calculations: 1) Geometry lengths (Pythagoras), 2) Each member force by node equilibria/fan analysis, 3) Total member mass based on length and cross-section.",\n    "calculation": "Geometry: node_1 (0,0), node_3 (2,0), node_2 (6,0), node_4 (3,2.50).

Force estimation: The largest member force will correspond to the edgemost in the main truss panel, taken as the highest vertical, expected <18.0 kN. Using area_id \'3\' (1.759) for m4, m5. For other smaller diagonal chords/horizontals, keep area_id \'1\' (0.195). Member lengths from coordinates. Estimated total mass: compute: ~5× small + 2× larger members < 5.0 kg. Maximum member stress conservatively estimated just at or below material limit to stay well within ratio to total mass for constraints.",\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Cost check: All member connections form complete triangles, each supported node is directly tied into triangulation. No overspans or underbraced panels. With no members longer than √(3^2+2.5^2) ≈ 3.905 or ~6, and with area_id \'3\' (1.759) assigned to the likely most loaded vertical/member, total mass will be far below the previous solutions.
