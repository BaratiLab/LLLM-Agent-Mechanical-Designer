All area choices must follow specified discrete values.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "This truss must connect three colinear nodes (node_1 at (0,0), node_3 at (2,0), node_2 at (6,0)), each with supports (node_1 is pinned; others are roller). Major load acts on interior node_3. Objective focuses on resilience and low mass achieved through optimal geometry and minimum-compliance element sizing. Need at least one extra node for structurally sound triangulation and to channel vertical components of the load. Most logical solution is a simple \'Warren\'-type (single triangle) with an optimal top chord node.",\n    \n    "analysis": "All original nodes are aligned along the x-axis, making them colinear. Colinear-only connections yield an unstable/flexible structure for out-of-plane loads like these. To ensure geometric stability and optimal direct load paths, introducing an apex (off-axis) node above the span gives a statically determinate, closed triangle—the lightest, most efficient configuration. The apex should be centrally above (apex_x ≈ midpoint) with sufficient rise to maintain minimum angle (better force paths, reduced bending moments, and efficient area usage). Optimum area selection requires balancing low max stress versus section mass for all members. The load at node_3 introduces large vertical and horizontal components. By raising apex M at (apex_x, y>0), structure forms two sloped ties and a bottom horizontal chord, creating direct load path, preventing large lever action, and making all force-carrying members as short as possible to minimize mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Issue: With (0,0), (2,0), (6,0) and load at (2,0), direct connections alone can\'t carry vertical load effectively due to colinearity. Adding off-axis node_4 (‘apex’) to (mid-span, y>0) enables a nearly equilateral triangle, best balancing load flow and minimal lengths. Keeping the vertical rise moderate ensures reasonable member force calculations while respecting total mass limit. Connections will be: node_1 - node_4, node_2 - node_4, node_1 - node_3, node_3 - node_4, node_2 - node_3 (min length). Optimal area allocation matches force predicted in each member.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Triangulation via an added apex node_4 at (3.0, 2.1): strong symmetry aids equal load splitting for the significant vertical and horizontal lading at node_3. Choosing this rise: (i) reduces horizontal tie length and achieves direct ideal force-path to supports (minimizing max force + length). Apex isn\'t too high (would increase length/cost) or too flat (would magnify inclinations/stresses). Chose 2.1 units rise (approximate \'optimum\'). By force balance at node_3 and node_4, find the member with max force to set area, then set all others at minimum which keep stress below area threshold. Chosen areas ensure all stresses below the limit, selected to balance tradeoff between area (lower stress, heavier) and mass constraint. Most loaded member calculated to restrict all area_id choices. Remaining ties sized to minimize overall mass while meeting global safety constraints.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: steel truss (units N and m), member area as given (mapping area_id to area in cm^2 → m^2: just proportional, so ratios scale out). Procedure: Compute node_4 at (3.0, 2.1). Connections: (node_1, node_3), (node_1, node_4), (node_2, node_3), (node_2, node_4), (node_3, node_4). Forces: With pinpointed, vertical load, end supports balance. Perform vertical/horizontal force equilibrium at node_3 (with true geometry), set up equilibrium equations to find internal member forces (assume uniform E; disregard buckling due both tension and compression present and impact the sizing). Use area to deduce member stress, sum member length * area to get mass (per area_id chart provided), check all constraints for compliance, then select final member areas.",\n    \n    "calculation": "\n1.
