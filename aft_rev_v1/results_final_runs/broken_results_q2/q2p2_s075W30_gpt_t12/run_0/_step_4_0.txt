Previous designs violated both the stress-to-weight (≤0.75) and mass (≤30) constraints. The goal is to design a closed structure—truly triangulated or multiple-load-path—for minimum stress-to-weight ratio within constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Stress-to-weight ratio is highly excessive in all prior attempts (minimum seen is 1.33), primarily due to excessive stress in short or undersized horizontal members. Prior designs use weak connections between node_1, node_2, node_3 and have insufficient triangulation above the loaded node. Current node positions do not funnel load optimally to supports. Propose additional upper node and strategic triangulation.",\n    \n    "analysis": "All prior/existing structures violate stress-to-weight, mostly due to high stress in horizontal members attached to the loaded node (member_5, member_1 etc). Too much stress is focused on members that pass directly between supports and node_3, indicating poor load spreading. Attempts to add verticals/divide span did not solve constraint, meaning deeper height/depth (better lever-arm for moment balancing) is needed above the span. Historic minimum stress-to-weight is 1.33, mass is 12.41. Clearly truss must be globally stiffer. Node placement is too shallow, and properly sized triangulation is missing/lacking.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Improve by (1) adding at least one high node above node_3 to enable load spreading via triangulated members and (2) increasing vertical drop from apex to node_1/node_2 for better stiffness. Use smallest area compatible with force paths and check up-sizing where needed. Closing triangles to prevent isolated force-chains.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign: create a simple triangulated Pratt or Howe truss using node_1 and node_2 at base (fixed), original node_3 as bottom, one main apex node higher than previous (expand to ~6.0 units above), secondary node near node_3 but above it (~2 units upward), form two triangles by connecting upper node to all base/support nodes and to node_3; all existing constraints/loads remain the same. All nodes with loads/supports remain fixed per instructions.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "High apex increases vertical separation—gives longer, lower-force compression struts; spread web members distribute load more evenly; truss depth near node_3 improves moment resistance and lowers forces in lower chord. Triangulation ensures no single over-stressed member. Forces now share load across multiple members, greatly reducing both max local force and global stress-to-weight ratio. No member runs untriangulated between node_3 and either support, by structural principle.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": [\n        "Check force balance at all nodes",\n        "Estimate force in each member (vertical loads flow through two triangles; diagonals/upper chords take some compression; lower has tension).
