The structure must connect three fixed nodes, endure an off-axis external load, and utilize given cross-sectional area IDs to stay under allowed stress/mass. No prior truss topology is given; this is a one-shot design.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three nodes roughly in a line; need to ensure the structure is closed (all nodes in a single group). Three supports, with node 1 as pinned, node 2 and node 3 as rollers. Node 3 sees an external load of (-15, -30), i.e., upward-left away from the origin; must ensure forces and geometrical closure. Minimizing peak stress-to-weight. Dense triangulation is unnecessary due to few nodes.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Connections between each node form a triangle, providing force distribution and closure, which also minimizes peak member stress and ensures single connectivity. With three nodes, the only closed topology is a triangle. Applying force at off-center node 3 causes both vertical and leftwards reactions. Supports are adequate for equilibrium: pinned at node 1 takes x and y force, rollers at other nodes transfer force horizontally or vertically to ground, preferring stabilization in 2D.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "3-noded triangle truss is both minimal and necessary. Critical load input passes through node_3. To improve the stress distribution and satisfy constraints, cross-sectional area should be largest on highly loaded members. Considering trigonometry, the base is between node_1 and node_2, node_3 is between these in x,y at the base (colinear). Colinear nodes create a degenerate triangle; I can move or optimize by adding a mid-span node, but instructions restrict me from altering primary load node positions. Given all supports and nodes are on x-axis, I should introduce an interior node above the axis for valid triangulation, ensuring proper truss action.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Optimal truss will be a triangle but given initial nodes forming a degenerate base, performance is poor. Introducing one top node above the x-axis (\'node_4\') will create a viable triangle, connect all original nodes, and align major truss members with main force components. All real 2D trusses need at least 3 non-colinear points. This adds redundancy and distributes load efficiently. Member areas are selected such that the highest loaded members get largest feasible area (areas ‘10’ and ‘6’); the rest get minimal possible. Keeping mass <= 30 is easily feasible, as side lengths are moderate. Use basic static equilibrium and geometry (internal force splitting) for estimation.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All members are steel; yield stress not specified, focus is stress-to-weight ratio. Use cos/sin law for geometry. Forces in triangle with apex at node_4 will have most load on (node_3, node_4). For the area assignments: select \'10\' for members with max estimated force, others lower to minimize weight. Calculate member lengths using dist formula, total mass = sum(length × area). Compute force in each member via 2D resolution of input force at node_3, with triangle property. The highest force controls cross-section choice for that member; assume internal member stress = force/(area). Total weight ~ sum(length×area).",\n    \n    "calculation": "1. Place node_4 at (3.0, 3.0) to form a non-degenerate, spatial triangle spanning original nodes. Member connections: (1–2), (2–3), (3–1), plus (1–4), (2–4), (3–4). Compute distances: d(1,2)=6.00, d(2,3)=4.00, d(3,1)=2.00, d(1,4)=4.24, d(2,4)=4.24, d(3,4)=3.16. Area IDs: Assign \'10\' (19.548) to high-load members (3,4), \'3\' (1.759) for lower-loaded. Estimate member forces at node_3 per geometry: main force on (3,4), remainder on triangle edges. Total mass: (6×1.759)+(4×1.759)+(2×1.759)+(4.24×1.759)+(4.24×1.759)+(3.16×19.548)=10.55+7.04+3.52+7.46+7.46+61.82=97.85 (much over; thus use area scale down where possible). Instead, allocate areas: edge (3,4) gets \'6\', others get \'2\'. Re-compute: (6+4+2+4.24+4.24)×0.782 + 3.16×7.037 = 20.48×0.782+22.26=16.02+22.26=38.28. Nearly exceeds 30, so set (3,4)=’3’ instead, mass=6+4+2+4.24+4.24=20.48×0.782+3.16×1.759=16.02+5.56=21.58<30. Most loaded member’s stress: F(max)=33kN, area=1.759cm2=1.76e-4 m2 (if expressed in typical units) → σmax=F/A ~187 MPa. Use stress-to-weight: 33/21.58=1.53 >0.75 (over), so increase area for (3,4) and reduce elsewhere if possible. Assign \'4\' to (3,4), all others to \'1\' (0.195). New mass: 6+4+2+4.24+4.24=20.48×0.195+3.16×3.128=3.99+9.89=13.88: underweight! stress for area 3.128: σ=33/3.128=10.55, ratio=2.38>0.75, so up-area. Try ‘9’ for busiest, \'0\' for rest. Mass: 20.48×1+3.16×15.834=20.48+50.05=70.53>30. ‘6’ is best fit: 3.16×7.037=22.27. Try \'2\': 3.16×0.782=2.47, total mass=20.48+2.47=22.95, σ=33/0.782=42.24>0.75. None work with these high areas. Accept ‘4’ to busiest, all others ‘0’ (i.e., 1): mass=26.64, ratio=approx 1.2. Compromise: Use ‘5’ (4.887); 3.16×4.887=15.44; 20.48×1=20.48; mass=35.92. A compromise—reduce base length: reposition interior up; i.e. move node_4 to (3.0,2.0), n(3,4)=2.24. 2.24×4.887=10.94, rest is 20.48; total=31.42, now nearly within threshold. \'3\' (1.759): 2.24×1.759=3.94+20.48=24.42, σ=33/1.759=19, ratio=1.35>0.75. \'6\' (7.037): 2.24×7.037=15.76, mass=36.24, not low enough. The chief constraint is the high force from off-line geometry, so triangle must be as "stiff" (height minimized) as minimally needed angle, but node count fixed. Accept slightly exceeding ratio, emphasizing stretch on the key member.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Geometry as triangle with a raised node for bracing and area assignment pushed up to maximum sustainable at constraint.
