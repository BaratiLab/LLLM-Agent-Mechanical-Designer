Node-snap avoided; all nodes remain connected and the structure closed.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Input provides: three support nodes, nodes at loaded point, two distinct upper nodes in history/trials. Constraints violated typically due to high stress-to-weight and sometimes mass. Typical designs use one or two upper nodes above span and distribute force to supports. Sharp constraint: ratio must be <=0.75, mass <=30.",\n    "analysis": "In current design, max stress-to-weight=0.8594 (>0.75), mass=17.86 ok, failure from concentrated high stress in the main bottom member. Past variants (e.g. rank_1) succeeded in lowering ratio (0.6843) but often at cost of mass. Excessively low-mass open forms cause excessive stress on central/bottom members. Repetition of two upper nodes, little variation in verticality about the midspan. Diagonal bracing/triangulation/more distributed load path reduce main span stress.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Observation: Historic best ranked solution in history (rank_1) meets both constraints with ratio 0.6843, total mass 20.97. Its extra upper bracing vastly reduces max-stress-per-unit-mass, meeting all constraints. Current node placements (e.g. node_4 at [2,3.5], node_6 at [4.6,3.0]) make two \'high\' nodes; past best rank used node_4 at [2, 3.0], node_6 at [4, 3.0], with area_ids set larger for more loaded members, light for upper transverse.",\n    "proposal": "Adopt historic best solution (rank_1 from structure history): It achieves the required stress-to-weight ratio (0.6843<0.75), uses only essential upper bracing nodes ([2,3.0], [4,3.0]), maintains node support locations, and is thoroughly triangulated and closed. Minor fine-tune: adjust upper node positions ~0.1-0.2 downward for possible further stress trimming if space exists. Use efficient area selections indicated from rank_1 member_dict.",\n    "reasoning": "Triangular forms across the span reduce major member stress, while dual upper nodes direct load to all supports evenly (especially centering above loaded mid-node_3). Spreading out/supporting loaded node with triangulated braces to pinned and roller points, along with lighter members for upper ties, provides a lighter and stiffer structure. Avoids redundancy, meets mass limitations, exploits node-symmetry.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Mass=sum(length×area) over all members; stay at or below ~21 as in best prior design. Critical member is the central lower chord (node_1-node_3-node_2): set area to \'2\' for redundancy. Upper transverse (node_4-node_6, node_4-node_3 etc) can be smaller. Lateral/diagonal strengths easy to meet with \'2\'; keeping area minimal elsewhere.",\n    "calculation": "From historic rank_1 (dictated member masses/stresses provided), mass=20.97, ratio=0.6843. All member loads < 15 in stress, distribution of mass is optimal within those constraints. Ensures closure (triangulation covers all edges and supports). Total mass and stress ratio check out in historic context; no single member is isolated or overloaded.",\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Select rank_1 historic structure as-is; all constraints met. Make very minor downward shift (upper nodes at [2,2.95] and [4,2.95]) to reduce moments yet further: However, given history, modest changes won\'t yield drastic improvement — best to return robust, constraint-satisfying solution exactly.",\n    "node_dict": { \n        "node_1": (0.0, 0.0),        # Pinned support at left end; boundary node—required.\n        "node_2": (6.0, 0.0),        # Roller right end; boundary node—required.\n        "node_3": (2.0, 0.0),        # Loaded node; must stay at origin for load input.\n        "node_4": (2.0, 3.0),        # Upper bracing for robust load-transmission above node_3; triangulation.\n        "node_6": (4.0, 3.0)         # Upper node (right side, symmetry with node_4); enable upper tie and diags.\n    },\n    "member_dict": {\n        "member_1": ("node_1", "node_3", "2"),   # Lower chord (left), high load.\n        "member_2": ("node_3", "node_2", "2"),   # Lower chord (right), high load.\n        "member_3": ("node_1", "node_4", "2"),   # Left brace up to upper node.\n        "member_4": ("node_4", "node_3", "2"),   # Vertical/transverse from top to load node.\n        "member_5": ("node_4", "node_6", "2"),   # Upper chord tie\n        "member_6": ("node_6", "node_2", "2"),   # Right brace from upper node to support.\n        "member_7": ("node_3", "node_6", "2"),   # Diagonal from loaded node to upper right node.\n        "member_8": ("node_1", "node_6", "2")    # Diagonal from left pin to upper right; closure: full triangulation.\n    }\n}\n```\n', type='output_text')], role='assistant', status='completed', type='message')], parallel_tool_calls=True, temperature=1.2, tool_choice='auto', tools=[], top_p=1.0, max_output_tokens=None, previous_response_id=None, reasoning=Reasoning(effort=None, generate_summary=None, summary=None), service_tier='default', status='completed', text=ResponseTextConfig(format=ResponseFormatText(type='text')), truncation='disabled', usage=ResponseUsage(input_tokens=5529, input_tokens_details=InputTokensDetails(cached_tokens=0), output_tokens=1264, output_tokens_details=OutputTokensDetails(reasoning_tokens=0), total_tokens=6793), user=None, store=True)
