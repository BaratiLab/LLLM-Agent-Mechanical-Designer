The objective is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio, ensuring all constraints are met, particularly stress-to-weight ≤ 0.5 and total mass ≤ 30. All nodes must be connected, and only the provided area IDs are allowed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes form a base (node_1, node_2) and a loaded node (node_3) between them. Supports are: node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 (roller). The load on node_3 is (-15.0, -30.0). Must create a closed truss (triangle) with all nodes connected. Member areas chosen to minimize stress-to-weight while keeping mass low.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The structure is essentially a triangle: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0). However, node_3 is colinear with the base, making the triangle degenerate. To form a stable, triangulated structure, node_3 should be moved vertically (add a y-component). This allows effective force distribution and prevents mechanism. The direct load on node_3 is downward and leftward, so an upward diagonal member is needed. To minimize mass, the structure should be as compact as possible. The main failure mode is buckling or yielding in members under combined tension/compression from the applied load.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Colinear nodes yield a mechanism, so node_3 must be raised above the base. Placing node_3 at (2.0, 2.0) creates a right triangle, facilitating effective triangulation and load transfer. All three nodes are now connected. Choose member areas to balance stress and mass. The most loaded member is likely the vertical or diagonal from node_3 to the supports.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Move node_3 to (2.0, 2.0) to form a stable triangle. Connect all nodes: (1-2), (2-3), (3-1). This arrangement distributes the applied force at node_3 effectively to the supports. Assign larger area to the most loaded member (likely 3-1), and minimal area to less stressed members. This reduces max stress and total mass, optimizing the stress-to-weight ratio.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume node_3 at (2.0, 2.0). Members: 1-2 (base, 6.0 units), 2-3 (hypotenuse, sqrt(16+4)=~4.47 units), 3-1 (hypotenuse, sqrt(4+4)=~2.83 units). Load at node_3: (-15, -30). Use static equilibrium to estimate member forces. Assign area IDs: largest area to 3-1 (direct load path), medium to 2-3, smallest to 1-2. Calculate member forces using method of joints. Compute stresses (force/area), mass (sum of length × area). Ensure max(abs(stress))/total_weight ≤ 0.5 and total mass ≤ 30.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: 1-2: 6.0, 2-3: 4.47, 3-1: 2.83.
