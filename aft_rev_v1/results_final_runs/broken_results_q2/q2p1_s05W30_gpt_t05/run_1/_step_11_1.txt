The current and all historic designs fail to meet the stress-to-weight constraint, with the best feasible ratio at 0.511.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: Closed, efficient truss for (node_3: -15, -30) load, supports at nodes 1, 2, 3, minimize stress-to-weight, total mass ≤30. All historic designs violate the stress-to-weight constraint (best: 0.511). Need to reduce member stresses or increase mass judiciously. Node positions for supports and loaded node must remain fixed.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure uses a quadrilateral with a central vertical, but max stress is high due to long horizontal members (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2) with small area_ids (3). Increasing area increases mass, but stress-to-weight remains over 0.5. Historic solutions with more nodes (hex/truss arch) reduce max stress but at the cost of high mass, violating mass constraint. Most designs fail due to either high stress in long horizontal members or excessive mass from over-bracing. The load at node_3 is highly eccentric for the span, causing high force in the bottom chord. Current member layout is not optimally triangulated for efficient force distribution.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: High stress always in bottom chord between node_1-node_3 or node_3-node_2. Adding more vertical/higher nodes above node_3 reduces stress but often increases mass. Most efficient way is to triangulate above node_3, creating a shallow arch, distributing force over more members. Adding a central top node (node_5 at x=3, y~2.5-3.0) may help. Use higher area for the bottom chord, smaller for diagonals. Avoid unnecessary members.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign: Add a single top node (node_5) above the midspan (x=3.0, y=2.7), forming two triangles above node_3, improving force distribution. Connect node_5 to all base nodes (nodes 1, 2, 3). Use area_id \'4\' (3.128) for bottom chords (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2), area_id \'2\' (0.782) for diagonals and top chords. This should reduce peak stress in critical members while keeping mass under 30.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By adding node_5 at the top center, the truss forms two strong triangles, distributing the load from node_3 into both supports. This reduces the force in the long bottom chord, lowering max member stress. Using larger area only where necessary (bottom chord), and keeping diagonals lighter, controls mass.
