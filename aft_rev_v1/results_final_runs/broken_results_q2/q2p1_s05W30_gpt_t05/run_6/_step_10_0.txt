The current design and all historic structures violate the stress-to-weight ratio constraint (must be ≤0.5), though all are under the mass limit (≤30). The goal is to generate a closed, fully connected, minimal-mass truss with a stress-to-weight ratio under 0.5.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives: minimize stress-to-weight ratio (≤0.5), total mass ≤30, ensure all nodes and members are fully connected. Given supports and load locations are fixed. The current and historic structures are all over the stress-to-weight ratio limit, though some are close. Need to improve force distribution and triangulation for efficiency.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The load at node_3 is significant and off-center, creating both vertical and horizontal force components. In all prior designs, stress-to-weight ratios exceed 0.5, indicating either members are undersized or geometry is not distributing forces efficiently. Most designs use moderate triangulation, but member areas are moderate-to-large and still insufficient. The best (current) structure uses a Warren truss-like arrangement but is not symmetric, and some members are lightly loaded while others are highly stressed. The closed structure requirement is met, but force paths are not optimal, leading to high local stresses.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Most efficient structures use more triangulation and keep members short. The current structure has over-stressed bottom chords. Increasing vertical height above node_3, and moving top nodes further apart, could help. Adding a central top node for more direct force transfer may reduce maximum member stress. Using more members with smaller areas, and optimizing node locations for force alignment, can reduce peak stresses.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss by adding a central top node above node_3, forming a symmetric, double-triangle (Pratt or Howe) arrangement. This will distribute the load more evenly, reduce the span of heavily loaded members, and allow use of smaller area members. Retain original support and loaded node positions. Use minimal member areas where possible, increasing only for members with highest force. Ensure all nodes are connected and the structure is closed.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Symmetry about the mid-span (node_3) and maximizing vertical height above the load will reduce member forces. Triangulation with a central top node (node_6) at (3.0, 2.8) allows direct load transfer from node_3 to supports via short, steep members. The top chord will be in compression, bottom chord in tension. Diagonal bracing will help resist horizontal components and stabilize the structure. Use area_id \'1\' (0.195) for most members, and area_id \'2\' (0.782) for the most heavily loaded ones (bottom chord and diagonals from node_3).",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Load at node_3 is split symmetrically to supports via diagonals to top and bottom chords. Place node_6 at (3.0, 2.8) for maximum triangulation height. Connect node_3 to node_6 (vertical), node_1 to node_6, node_2 to node_6 (top chords), node_1 to node_3, node_2 to node_3 (bottom chords), and diagonals from node_1 to node_3, node_2 to node_3, node_1 to node_2. Use area_id \'2\' for bottom chords and diagonals, area_id \'1\' for others. Estimate member lengths and forces: vertical member (node_3 to node_6) carries most vertical load, diagonals split horizontal. Mass = Σ(length × area). Stress-to-weight ratio estimated by dividing max member force by total mass.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: bottom chord (node_1 to node_2) = 6.0; diagonals (node_1 to node_6) and (node_2 to node_6) = sqrt((3)^2 + (2.8)^2) ≈ 4.09; vertical (node_3 to node_6) = 2.8; bottom diagonals (node_1 to node_3, node_2 to node_3) = 2.0 and 4.0; top chord (node_6 to node_3) = 2.8. Assign areas: bottom chords and diagonals (likely highest force) get area_id \'2\' (0.782), vertical and top chords get area_id \'1\' (0.195). Total mass = sum(length × area). Max member force estimated at load path (approx 15-20), stress-to-weight ratio = max_force / total_mass. This arrangement should reduce max stress per member and distribute load efficiently, keeping stress-to-weight ratio under 0.5.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Verify: all nodes are connected, closed structure, no isolated nodes, stress-to-weight ratio under 0.5, total mass under 30. Adjust area_id upwards for any member if needed to satisfy stress constraint. Node coordinates precise to 1e-2. Remove members if redundant.
