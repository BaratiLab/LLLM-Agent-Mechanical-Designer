The current design violates the stress-to-weight constraint (ratio > 0.5), though mass is within limits. The objective is to redesign the truss to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio and keep mass ≤ 30, ensuring a closed, fully connected structure.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The current structure has a stress-to-weight ratio of 0.5627 (>0.5), violating the constraint, but mass is 22.5 (<30). The main issue is high stress in some members, particularly those connecting to node_3, which takes a large load. Prior attempts (history) used a similar node layout, but with higher mass and still high stress-to-weight ratio. The supports and loads are fixed; node_3 must remain at [2.0, 0.0].",\n    \n    "analysis": "The structure has 4 nodes: a base (nodes 1, 2, 3 colinear), and a top node (node_4) offset above. The load at node_3 is large and angled, creating high axial force in members connected to it. The current and historic structures use moderate areas for most members, but member_2 (node_1-node_3) and member_3 (node_2-node_3) see the highest stress. The top node\'s position and member sizing are crucial to distributing the load efficiently. The existing triangle is suboptimal: node_4 is too far right, causing shallow triangles and high force in the bottom chord. History shows moving node_4 left reduced stress-to-weight but increased mass. The structure is closed but not well triangulated for force flow.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key insight: The load at node_3 needs to be resolved more directly into the top node and the supports. The triangles should be steeper, so node_4 should move left and slightly down to shorten high-stress members. Reducing the span between node_3 and node_4 and increasing the angle between members will lower force in the bottom chord. Use minimal area for lightly loaded members, and increase area for those with the highest stress. Consider adding a diagonal member from node_4 to node_2 for better triangulation. All nodes must stay connected.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss by moving node_4 to (1.3, 2.2), forming steeper triangles, and adding a new diagonal member from node_4 to node_2. This will reduce the force in the bottom chord and distribute the load more efficiently. Use the smallest area (area_id \'1\') for lightly loaded members, and slightly increase the area for the most loaded members (likely those connected to node_3). This will lower the maximum stress and the stress-to-weight ratio while keeping mass under 30.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By moving node_4 left and down, we create steeper, more efficient triangles, reducing member length and stress. Adding a diagonal from node_4 to node_2 improves triangulation and load path redundancy. Member areas are assigned based on expected force: higher where load is greatest (node_3 connections), lower elsewhere. This approach balances mass and stress, ensuring the structure is closed and all nodes are connected.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Member_2 (node_1-node_3) and member_6 (node_3-node_4) will see the highest forces. Assign area_id \'3\' (1.759) to these, area_id \'1\' (0.195) to least loaded, and area_id \'2\' (0.782) to intermediates. Calculate member lengths using the new node_4 position (1.3, 2.2). Estimate mass as sum(length × area). Estimate max stress using statics (force triangles). Target stress-to-weight ratio < 0.5. All nodes must be connected, and supports/loads unchanged.",\n    \n    "calculation": "New node_4 at (1.3, 2.2):\\n- member_1 (node_1-node_2): length = 6.0, area_id \'1\' (0.195), mass = 1.17\\n- member_2 (node_1-node_3): length = 2.0, area_id \'3\' (1.759), mass = 3.52\\n- member_3 (node_2-node_3): length = 4.0, area_id \'2\' (0.782), mass = 3.13\\n- member_4 (node_1-node_4): sqrt((1.3-0)^2 + (2.2-0)^2) ≈ 2.58, area_id \'2\' (0.782), mass = 2.02\\n- member_5 (node_2-node_4): sqrt((6-1.3)^2 + (0-2.2)^2) ≈ 5.04, area_id \'1\' (0.195), mass = 0.98\\n- member_6 (node_3-node_4): sqrt((2.0-1.3)^2 + (0-2.2)^2) ≈ 2.31, area_id \'3\' (1.759), mass = 4.07\\n- member_7 (node_4-node_2): sqrt((1.3-6.0)^2 + (2.2-0)^2) ≈ 5.18, area_id \'1\' (0.195), mass = 1.01\\nTotal mass ≈ 15.90 (<30).
