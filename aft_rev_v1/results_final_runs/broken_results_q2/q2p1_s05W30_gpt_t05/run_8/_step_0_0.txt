The truss must be statically determinate and efficiently distribute the applied load.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The structure consists of three nodes in a near-linear arrangement along the x-axis. Node_1 is pinned, node_2 and node_3 are rollers. A significant load acts on node_3. The truss must be closed (all nodes connected), and the design must minimize stress-to-weight ratio under mass and stress constraints. Areas are chosen from a discrete set.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Given the supports, node_1 fixed in both axes, node_2 and node_3 can move vertically. The load on node_3 is (-15, -30), creating both horizontal and vertical demand. The most efficient layout is a triangle (three members: node_1-node_2, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_1) to ensure closure and direct load paths. The triangle configuration distributes the load efficiently, with all members engaged. The main failure mode is excessive stress in the member between node_3 and node_1 due to the large load. To further optimize, a fourth node could be added to form a Warren truss, but with only three nodes and a small span, the triangle is optimal for simplicity and weight.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The triangle is the simplest closed structure. Given the load\'s direction, the member from node_3 to node_1 will be most highly stressed. To minimize mass, use the smallest possible areas for less-stressed members and a larger area for the critical member. The geometry is fixed, so mass is directly proportional to area selection. Assign the largest area to the most stressed member, and smallest available to others to minimize total mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation ensures rigidity and force distribution. The direct connection between node_1 and node_3 provides a load path for both x and y components of the force. The other two members stabilize the structure and close the truss. No additional nodes are needed due to the small number of supports and span. Area assignment should be based on estimated axial forces, with area_id \'4\' (3.128) for the most stressed member and area_id \'1\' (0.195) for the others, balancing safety and mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All members are pin-connected, loads are static, and material is uniform. Calculate member lengths via distance formula. Find angles for force decomposition. Use method of joints to estimate member forces. For the most critical member (node_1-node_3), estimate force as the vector sum of applied load, adjusted for geometry. Compute mass = sum(length_i * area_i). Compute stress = force/area. Check constraints: stress-to-weight ratio and total mass.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_2: 6.0m, node_2-node_3: 4.0m, node_3-node_1: sqrt((2-0)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 2.0m. But node_3 is at (2,0), node_1 at (0,0), node_2 at (6,0), so node_2-node_3 is 4.0m. The triangle is: (0,0)-(6,0)-(2,0). However, all are collinear, which is unstable. To close the truss, move node_3 slightly off the x-axis. Place node_3 at (2.0, 2.0) to create a triangle. Now: node_1-node_2: 6.0m; node_2-node_3: sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-2)^2) = sqrt(16+4)=4.47m; node_3-node_1: sqrt((2-0)^2 + (2-0)^2)=2.83m. Estimate member forces: load at node_3 is split between node_3-node_1 and node_3-node_2. Assume worst-case: all load in node_3-node_1, F= sqrt(15^2+30^2)=33.54kN. Assign area_id \'4\' (3.128) to node_3-node_1. For others, use area_id \'1\' (0.195). Mass = (6.0*0.195)+(4.47*0.195)+(2.83*3.128)=1.17+0.87+8.86=10.9 < 30. Stress in node_3-node_1: 33.54/3.128=10.73kN/m^2. Stress-to-weight: 10.73/10.9=0.98 > 0.5. Increase area to area_id \'6\' (7.037): mass=1.17+0.87+2.83*7.037=1.17+0.87+19.92=21.96.
