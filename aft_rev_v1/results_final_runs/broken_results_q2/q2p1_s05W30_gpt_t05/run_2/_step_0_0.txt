The goal is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio while ensuring all constraints (stress-to-weight ≤ 0.5, mass ≤ 30) are satisfied. The design must be fully connected and efficient.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes given, all on x-axis: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0). Loads are applied at node_3 (-15kN x, -30kN y). node_1 is pinned, node_2 and node_3 are rollers. Need to ensure a closed truss (all nodes connected). Triangulation is essential for stability and optimal load transfer. Must select member areas to balance stress and mass.",\n    \n    "analysis": "With all nodes colinear on x-axis, a direct triangle is impossible. To create a closed, triangulated truss, I must introduce at least one new node off the x-axis. Placing a new node above the x-axis (say, node_4 at (2.0, 2.5)) allows triangulation and efficient load transfer. The load at node_3 is downward and leftward, so an upper node helps resolve vertical and horizontal forces. Members: (node_1-node_2), (node_2-node_3), (node_3-node_1) do not triangulate; need diagonals. Supports and loads suggest node_4 should be above node_3 for best geometry.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key is to add node_4 at (2.0, 2.5) to form triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4), (node_3, node_2, node_4), (node_1, node_2, node_4). This provides a stable, closed truss and allows efficient force distribution. All nodes are connected. Member selection: prioritize larger areas for highly loaded members (especially those directly resisting the applied force), smaller for others. Total member length and area must keep mass ≤ 30. Stress-to-weight ratio must be checked for all members.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation is essential for stability and minimal stress. Adding node_4 above node_3 allows all nodes to participate in a single, closed, triangulated structure. Members from node_3 to node_4 will carry significant vertical loads. Members from node_1 to node_4 and node_2 to node_4 distribute forces efficiently. Use largest permissible area for the most loaded member (node_3-node_4), moderate areas for others. All members must be unique and connect existing nodes.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Steel truss, E irrelevant for statics. Areas are from table. Estimate member lengths and forces. Members: 1) node_1-node_3, 2) node_2-node_3, 3) node_1-node_4, 4) node_2-node_4, 5) node_3-node_4. Calculate lengths using distance formula. Assign largest area to member_5 (node_3-node_4), moderate to diagonals, smallest to horizontals. Calculate forces using method of joints (approximate for quick check).
