The objective is to redesign a fully connected 2D truss with the given supports and loads to reduce stress-to-weight ratio below 0.75 and mass below 30, while maintaining structural integrity and load paths.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given a 4-node truss with nodes on a horizontal line (node_1, node_2, node_3) and node_4 elevated at (2,3). Load is applied downward-left at node_3. Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 and node_3 rollers. Current members form a partial triangle with some long members causing high stress on member_4 (node_1-node_3). Constraints: max stress-to-weight ratio ≤ 0.75, total mass ≤ 30. Current design violates both.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 is large and directed left and down, causing high stress in member_4 (node_1-node_3) which is thin (area_id \'1\' = 0.195). This member carries 50.3 max stress, causing ratio violation. The mass is high due to large cross-sections (area_id \'4\' = 3.128) on long members (node_1-node_4 and node_4-node_2). The structure is not fully triangulated around node_3, leading to stress concentration. The roller support at node_3 limits vertical reaction but not horizontal, so load transfer to node_1 and node_2 is critical. The current design lacks redundancy and efficient load paths. The history shows no better structure found.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Key issues are: member_4 is overstressed due to small area and direct load path; members with large area add mass; node_3 on the baseline line with load but no vertical elevation reduces triangulation. To reduce stress-to-weight ratio, redistribute load by adding triangulation around node_3 and reduce member sizes where possible. Node_4 at (2,3) is useful but can be repositioned to improve load paths. Supports cannot be changed. Node_3 position fixed due to load and support. Aim for a closed truss with triangulation around node_3 and node_4 to spread load efficiently.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Redesign the structure by repositioning node_4 higher and slightly right to enhance triangulation and load path from node_3 to node_1 and node_2. Add a diagonal member between node_3 and node_2 to form a closed triangle with node_4. Adjust member areas: use larger areas for heavily loaded members and reduce areas on less stressed members to reduce mass. Keep supports and loaded nodes fixed. This should reduce maximum stress and total mass, satisfying constraints.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Elevating node_4 to (3.00, 3.50) creates better geometry for force distribution. Adding member_6 connecting node_3 to node_2 creates a triangle that shares load from node_3 to node_2 support, reducing stress in member_4. Members from node_1 to node_4 and node_4 to node_2 remain but with optimized cross-sectional areas. Member_4 (node_1-node_3) area increased to reduce stress. Member areas chosen from given discrete set balancing mass and strength. Triangulated geometry improves stability and load transfer. Supports fixed, so node positions and member layout are key to reduce stress concentration.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Uniform material, stress proportional to axial force / area.

Calculate member lengths, assign areas to keep total mass ≤30. Estimate max stress by considering load distribution and triangulation. Use larger area for heavily loaded members (node_1-node_3), moderate for node_1-node_4 and node_4-node_2, small for diagonals. Check stress-to-weight ratio = max_stress / total_mass ≤ 0.75.
