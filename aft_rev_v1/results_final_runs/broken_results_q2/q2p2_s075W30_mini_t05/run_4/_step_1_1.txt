Objective is to minimize max stress-to-weight ratio below 0.75 while keeping mass under 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Initial structure has nodes mostly on x-axis except node_4 elevated at y=3. Members form a near-triangle with an internal diagonal. Current max stress-to-weight ratio is 0.7352, close to limit. Mass is 17.33, well under 30. Load applied at node_3 causes tension in member_1 and compression in others. Need to check if geometry or member sizing can improve ratio.",\n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-15, -30) creates significant tension in member_1 (node_1-node_3) with highest negative stress (-12.74). Member_5 (diagonal node_3-node_4) carries moderate tension (2.87). Members 2,3,4 near zero stress or compression. Supports fix node_1 pinned, node_2 and node_3 rollers allow vertical displacement but no horizontal for node_1. Current design mass is 17.33, far below limit, suggesting room for area increase or geometry change. The structure is stable and closed with 4 nodes and 5 members. The internal diagonal (member_5) is critical for triangulation and load transfer. The current max stress-to-weight ratio is close to constraint limit 0.75, so improvements must reduce max stress or increase mass efficiently.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Current structure is stable and satisfies constraints. The highest stress is in member_1, which is the shortest member on the bottom left. The load direction induces tension in member_1 and diagonal member_5. Members 2,3,4 carry little load, potentially oversized. Node_4 at (2,3) provides vertical support but may be optimized in position to reduce stresses. Member_2 (node_3-node_2) is long and lightly stressed. Member areas can be adjusted, but current areas are mostly small (0,2,3,1). Possibly increasing area in member_1 and reducing others could help. Node_3 is fixed due to load and support, so node_4 or node_2 positions could be adjusted slightly to improve load paths.",\n  "proposal": "Optimize current structure by slight repositioning of node_4 upwards and shifting node_2 slightly right to better distribute load and reduce peak stress in member_1. Adjust member areas to increase area of high stress members (member_1 and member_5) and reduce area of low stress members (member_3 and member_4). Maintain closed 4-node structure with 5 members. Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed in x and y as per supports and load constraints.",\n  "reasoning": "Triangulated structures efficiently carry loads. Moving node_4 slightly higher will increase diagonal member length and reduce stress concentration in member_1. Shifting node_2 slightly right will increase member_2 length but reduce stress in member_1 by better load path. Increasing cross-sectional area of high stress members reduces stress (stress = force/area). Reducing area of lightly loaded members reduces mass. Member areas chosen from given discrete set. Node_3 fixed due to load and support. Node_1 fixed pinned at origin. Node_2 roller on x-axis, so x can be adjusted but y=0 fixed. Node_4 free to move vertically to optimize.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and forces using geometry and applied load. Use equilibrium equations at nodes to find member forces. Calculate stresses = force/area. Calculate mass = sum(length * area). Adjust node_4 y-coordinate from 3.0 up to ~3.5 in steps, node_2 x-coordinate from 6.0 to 6.5. Select member areas from {\'0\':1, \'1\':0.195, \'2\':0.782, \'3\':1.759, \'4\':3.128, \'5\':4.887}. Start with member_1 and member_5 area \'4\' (3.128) or \'5\' (4.887) to reduce stress. Reduce member_3 and member_4 to \'1\' or \'0\' to save mass. Iterate until stress-to-weight ratio <0.7352 or improved.",\n  "calculation": "Set node_4 at (2.0, 3.3), node_2 at (6.3, 0.0).

Approximate max force from load and geometry: member_1 force reduced due to increased area, stress = force/area decreases, estimate max stress ~10.5.
