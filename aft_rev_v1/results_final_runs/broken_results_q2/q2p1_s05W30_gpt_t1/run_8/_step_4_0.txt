The current structure does not satisfy the maximum stress-to-weight ratio constraint, with a stress-to-weight ratio of 3.04 (>0.5) and a total mass of 13.51 (<30). The goal is a redesign or improvement that ensures both constraints are strictly met while minimizing the stress-to-weight ratio.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives: (1) stress-to-weight ratio <= 0.5, (2) total mass <= 30, (3) all nodes structurally connected, (4) fixed node/support locations, (5) node_3 is loaded. Current/historic solutions fail the stress ratio, all have ratios >0.8 and up to 3+. Major load at node_3 is both horizontal and vertical, so structure must resolve significant moment/force at node_3, and all supports are at y=0.",\n    "analysis": "The current and historical truss layouts are compact, polycentric Pratt/K-truss variants, but all concentrate stress on lower-chord members adjacent to node_3. Load at node_3 is (-15, -30) (left & down), thus demanding strong lower and diagonal members, especially towards node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Past designs use small cross-sectional areas (\'1\' or \'2\'; A=0.195 or 0.782), yielding high stresses. Additionally, top chords are present, but positions and areas don\'t optimally balance the load or reduce lever arms. Triangulation is present but not optimized for load transfer; support at node_3 (roller) may cause horizontal instability if not braced. Members along (node_1-node_2), (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2) are likely the most stressed.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Past attempts under-designed lower chord & diagonals close to node_3 (where force, esp. vertical, is highest). To reduce stress-to-weight: (a) increase member area selectively only for critical members, (b) adjust triangles to align diagonals along force flux paths, (c) minimize member count yet maintain triangulation. Remove redundant mid-chord nodes if little force transfer seen. Add a top node above node_3 to shorten force path to supports (thus reducing moment arm, stress and weight).",\n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss as a Warren truss by introducing a top node above node_3, reconfiguring existing nodes for better triangulation, and upscaling area only for the most critical bottom/diagonal members. Minimal node changes: keep all fixed/support/load nodes in position; add node_6 above node_3 to serve as top apex. Use large areas (\'0\':1, \'2\':0.782, and \'3\':1.759) only at lowest, most-loaded members. Remove internal mid-chord nodes unless structurally necessary. Connect each support to node_6, forming an efficient triangle, and create a closed network with minimal overlapping members.",\n    "reasoning": "Placing node_6 above node_3 at (2.00, 2.5) creates an efficient triangulated system to redirect load directly to both supports, reducing member forces and thus stress in key areas. Triangular substructures ensure no long, highly-stressed unbraced members. Enlarged member areas are applied only along the bottom chord (node_1-node_3-node_2) and the diagonals from supports to node_6. Short top chords and diagonal braces further distribute load. No isolated nodes; all are included in triangles.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Key assumptions: Use area \'3\' (1.759) for bottom chord and main diagonals; area \'1\' (0.195) for unloaded top chord/verticals; area \'2\' (0.782) for intermediate loaded diagonals. Layout: node_4=(2.0,2.5) above node_3, node_5 between nodes_2-node_4. Calculate lengths and estimated member forces via vector resolution: the triangle (node_1-node_4-node_2) will take most of the vertical and horizontal load. Approximate total mass from member lengths × areas. Check all critical member stresses for compliance (<0.5 stress/weight). Top cord is lightly loaded and can be very slender.",\n    "calculation": "Main load of -15,-30 at node_3 is resisted by direct diagonals from node_4 (2.0,2.5) down to node_1, node_2. By moving force path vertically via node_4, diagonal members become shorter, load and moment arm decrease, lowering peak stress. Member areas: chord and main diagonals=\'3\' (A=1.759), secondary diagonals/verticals=\'2\', topmost or unloaded=\'1\'. Member lengths: node_1-(0,0) to node_3-(2,0):2.00; node_3-(2,0) to node_2-(6,0):4.00; node_1-(0,0) to node_4-(2,2.5):~3.20; node_4-(2,2.5) to node_2-(6,0):~4.72. Estimate mass: sum(length × area) = main chords: 2.0×1.759+4.0×1.759=10.554; diagonals: 3.2×1.759+4.72×1.759=13.864; minor members: say 2.0×0.782+2.0×0.195+2.0×0.195=2.49. Total mass: ~26.9, under 30. Max single member force (before division by mass): member_3 (node_1-node_4), expected to take a major portion of vertical force, but with sufficient area, stress reduced. For 46kN as in prior configs, now force splits via two triangles, so stresses drop below 13 (as in the prior best case at higher mass), and with mass much higher, ratio ~0.48.",\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Design is fully triangulated, all nodes connected, areas appropriately upsized for critical members, total mass below 30, and stress-to-weight ratio estimated below 0.5.
