The goal is strict minimization of the max-stress-to-total-weight ratio under a 0.5 upper limit, and total mass ≤ 30 units. Member area choices are restricted to a discrete set.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Three collinear nodes are given along the x-axis: node_1 (pinned, left), node_2 (roller, right), node_3 (roller, between them). The downward/leftward load at node_3 complicates simple linear (degenerate) solutions. The truss must close and leverage triangulation for efficient transfer. Triangular geometry or the addition of one vertex seems a likely route to distribute load efficiently.",\n    \n    "analysis": "With all nodes collinear, any direct connection (i.e., just between the three nodes) would result in an unstable and non-statically determinate truss, especially for vertical/shear loads at node_3. Since node_1 is pinned and node_2/3 are on rollers, the structure needs vertical stiffness and to avoid mechanisms. The load at node_3 has a strong vertical component. Closing the truss requires an additional node off the x-axis and triangulated connections, forming a stable, rigid structure. Efficient force transfer would send some load from node_3 directly toward the supports, while triangulation prevents buckling and reduces max stress.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "A practical minimum for stable triangulation is to introduce an off-line node (say node_4) above the x-axis, creating two triangles: node_1–node_3–node_4 and node_3–node_2–node_4 (a classic \'truss arch\'). Placement of node_4 should balance stress among members and keep member lengths (and thus mass) low. Moreover, members connected should approximate direct load paths from node_3 to both supports.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By adding node_4 above node_3—centered in x and some moderate y—members (node_3–node_4, node_4–node_1, node_4–node_2, node_3–node_1, node_3–node_2) form two robust triangles, closing the structure. Stress is lowest with short, direct compression/tension members in line with load vectors. I\'ll set node_4 at (3.0, 2.5), a compact, almost equilateral configuration, minimizing member lengths and balancing load distribution. Initial member area assignment will favor the minimum standard area id for all except the high-stress member (node_3–node_4), which takes the next higher id to ensure ratio constraints are met.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Steel-like material, all area units arbitrary but consistent. Members: node_1–node_2, node_2–node_3, node_3–node_1 (base triangle closure), node_1–node_4, node_2–node_4, node_3–node_4 (extend load transfer), all unique. Calculate strengths: For the worst member (likely node_3–node_4): F_max ≈ sqrt(15^2 + 30^2) ≈ 33.54. Lengths: node_3–node_4 ≈ sqrt((3-2)^2 + (2.5-0)^2)=sqrt(1+6.25)=2.69, etc. Mass = Σ(length * area). Assign area_ids: start with \'1\' (0.195) for most, use \'3\' (1.759) if max stress exceeds area * allowable ratio. Stress-to-weight: Calculate all member forces under load, find worst, and divide by mass.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node coordinates:\\nnode_1: (0.0, 0.0)\\nnode_2: (6.0, 0.0)\\nnode_3: (2.0, 0.0)\\nnode_4: (3.0, 2.5)\\nMember lengths: l12=6.0, l23=4.0, l31=2.0, l14=3.90, l24=3.90, l34=2.69\\nEstimate forces: Load applied mainly to node_3–node_4 and node_3–node_1/2; triangulation spreads load. By method of joints, node_3 resists -15X, -30Y transferred via members to node_4 and base: assign largest area to node_3–node_4, id=\'3\'. All others set to id=\'1\'.\\nMass: (6.0+4.0+2.0+3.90+3.90+2.69)*(areas) = [6*0.195+4*0.195+2*0.195+3.9*0.195+3.9*0.195+2.69*1.759]=1.17+0.78+0.39+0.76+0.76+4.73=8.59 <30. Max member force ≈ 33.5, so max(abs(stress))=33.5/1.759=19.05 (member_6); ratio=19.05/8.59=2.22 > 0.5. To satisfy ratio constraint, either area of member_6 must be increased or member length reduced (node_4 raised higher, but that increases length not reduces stress). Try area_id=\'6\' (7.037): stress=33.5/7.037=4.76; ratio=4.76/12.87=0.37<0.5. New mass is (6.0+4.0+2.0+3.9+3.9)*0.195 + 2.69*7.037 = 2.34+10.57=12.91. This meets both ratio and weight constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Final check: All members are unique and close the structure; all nodes participate; maximum stress-to-weight ratio is within bounds (0.37); mass < 30.
