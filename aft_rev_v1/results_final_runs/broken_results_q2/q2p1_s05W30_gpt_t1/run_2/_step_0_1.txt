Full connectivity (closed structure) and careful area selection are required to maximize efficiency while keeping stress-to-weight below 0.5 and total mass below 30 units.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Three base nodes provided: two at (0,0) and (6,0) with a loaded node at (2,0). Supports are pinned/roller, and node_3 gets a large (−15, −30) load. All nodes must form a closed truss, potentially with added nodes for triangulation and improved stability. Select member areas from a discrete set, keeping mass and stress-to-weight within constraints.",\n\n    "analysis": "With node_3 loaded down-right, a basic triangle between all three nodes provides closure but has zero vertical height, making it inefficient for force-splitting. Any loads applied to node_3 will induce very high stresses without triangulation. A robust design needs a vertical offset to optimize load path and significantly reduce the max member stress: adding a fourth node above node_3 creates an efficient, load-sharing, weight-efficient truss. The supports ensure determinate stability. A lightweight triangulated system using minimum area members where possible is preferred, but the high load (−30 vertical) requires judicious area sizing for certain key members.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "A single triangle is not effective as all nodes lie on the x-axis. Adding an apex above the base nodes allows triangulation, and splits the vertical force into efficient compressive and tensile paths. Ensuring no duplicate members and a fully closed structure. Focus effort on minimizing area for the longest members under low force, while sizing high-force members (those around node_3) appropriately. The structure\'s weight is largely a function of member length and area ID.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Symmetrically add node_4 at (2,2.8) (height chosen so base is narrow but area/weight is controlled; vertical offset chosen based on geometry and force split). Connect all nodes (1-2-3-4-1 and diagonals) to form a triangulated quadrilateral. The load at node_3 distributes effectively in two triangles, drastically lowering max member stress if the triangles are acute. Concentrate larger area on high-force members (node_3 to node_4, node_4 to supports), use minimal area elsewhere. Confirm closure and calculate member forces for optimum design.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: (i) Steel (E irrelevant here as mass constraint is more limiting), (ii) All joints pinned/pure tension/compression, (iii) Area IDs from given set, (iv) Use centroid geometry for quick force calculation. Calculations: 1. Find suitable y-coordinate for node_4 (set, say, y=2.8 for a sharp triangle), 2. Determine member lengths, 3. Static equilibrium at all nodes (focus on node_3 - large load), 4. Calculate member forces using method-of-joints, 5. Compute axial stress = F/A for each member, choose area to keep max|stress|/weight ≤ 0.5, 6. Total mass = sum of (length × area)≤30.",\n    \n    "calculation": "1. New node_4 at (2.0, 2.8). 2. Member lengths (approx): node_3-node_4: sqrt((0)^2 + (2.8)^2) = 2.8; node_1-node_3: 2.0; node_2-node_3: 4.0; node_1-node_4: sqrt((2)^2+(2.8)^2) ≈ 3.44; node_2-node_4: sqrt((4)^2+(2.8)^2) ≈ 4.88; node_1-node_2: 6.0. 3. Equilibrium: Load at node_3 (-15,-30). With the triangle node_3-node_4-node_1 and node_3-node_4-node_2, the vertical load splits between the diagonals: Using symmetry and vector trigonometry, majority of vertical force enters member node_3-node_4, and the horizontal into node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3. 4. Stresses: Largest demand is on node_3-node_4, carrying ≈ sqrt(15^2 + 30^2) = 33.54kN. With area_id \'4\' (3.128 units), stress ≈ 33.54/3.128 ≈ 10.73, well below mass/stress constraint after mass check. 5. Compute mass: Total mass = sum(length × area) = (2.8×3.128) + (2.0+4.0+3.44+4.88+6.0)×0.195 ≈ 8.76 + 3.33 = 12.09. Stress-to-weight = 10.73/12.09 ≈ 0.89; above 0.5. Increase area_id for node_3-node_4 to \'6\' (7.037): mass now 2.8×7.037=19.7, total ~23.2; stress=33.54/7.037≈4.77, ratio=4.77/23.2≈0.21. Well within limits.
