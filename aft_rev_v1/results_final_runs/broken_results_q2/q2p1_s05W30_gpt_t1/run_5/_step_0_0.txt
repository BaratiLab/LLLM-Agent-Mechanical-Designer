Objective is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio while maintaining all structure and mass constraints.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), with node_1 pinned, node_2 and node_3 roller supported.

Areas selectable from discrete values.",\n\n    "analysis": "With all supports on the x-axis and load applied not at an end node, this is a horizontally stretched triangle. Loads transmit from node_3 to nodes_1 and 2. The triangle must be braced to avoid mechanisms; a basic triangle is optimal given three nodes. Direct truss (nodes_1-2-3-1) closes the structure. Maximum force will be in the vertical (node_1-node_3) and inclined (node_2-node_3) members due to load direction. Since area must be high enough to keep max(abs(stress))/weight ≤ 0.5, but overall weight ≤ 30, optimal area choices are needed.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Hand-analysis: the direct triangle is efficient since it places all members in tension or compression so that axial forces carry the load. The high vertical load at node_3 will generate significant force in members to nodes_1 and 2. Because all nodes are on the x-axis, the triangle is flat; this concentrates forces and requires careful area selection to avoid overstressing any member.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Symmetrical triangles for 3-point trusses are most effective under eccentric or bi-axial tip loading. Triangulation is automatically satisfied with a triangle. No additional node needed as all three supports/load are engaged in equilibrium. Members: (node_1,node_2), (node_2,node_3), (node_3,node_1). Pick areas so that the max member stress is less than (0.5*total_weight), but total weight ≤ 30.
