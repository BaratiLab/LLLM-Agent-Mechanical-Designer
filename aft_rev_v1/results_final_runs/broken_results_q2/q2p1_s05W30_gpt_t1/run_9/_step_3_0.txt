Current and previous designs violate the mass constraint and/or produce excessive stress-to-weight ratios. My goal is to deliver an efficient, connected truss that meets both constraints in one iteration.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs show the load is applied at node_3, which is a support/roller. Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 (roller) create a statically determinate problem with symmetry about the x-axis. Prior designs are overbuilt (excess mass), use high area sections, or create inefficient load paths. All nodes must be connected and no supports or loaded points moved.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure is overbuilt: max stress-to-weight is low (~0.19), but mass is 35.43 (>30). Prior, lighter trusses either exceeded stress limits (14.83, 53.61) and/or stress-to-weight ratios (~0.65, 4.7). The reason: insufficient triangulation and poor section selection resulted in localized overstress, while overbuilt solutions rely on large area members. The lower trusses failed due to insufficient triangulation and too-thin members on long spans. Thus, efficient triangulation with smaller area members and fewer verticals is needed for low mass and stress spread. Key supports are at nodes 1 (0,0, pinned), 2 (6,0, roller), 3 (2,0, roller), with a downward/left load at node_3. A lightweight, triangulated solution focusing on direct load paths and minimal member count will be optimal.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Prior successful trusses with minimal members fell short due to poor stress distribution on the bottom chord (large negative stresses at midspan), while highly connected trusses had excess mass from too many heavy members. The load at node_3 (which is both loaded and supported) creates high shears and bending; truss solutions must efficiently carry this to the base. Efficient node positions must use minimal height to maximize member length for better mass distribution; ideal layout is a shallow triangle with two top chords and bracing. Placing one or two top nodes aligned above node_3 with short diagonals connecting to supports improves stability while reducing excessive vertical members.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign for high-efficiency: use 5 nodes (existing support/load nodes and two top-chord nodes), create a shallow \'Warren\' or Pratt-type truss with one top node centered above node_3 (highest load), minimizing height to reduce member length and mass. All area sections switch to \'1\' or \'2\' for most members, using \'3\' only at highest-stressed diagonals. Remove redundant verticals and unnecessary bracing. The truss remains fully connected. Node positions are adjusted only for non-support/load nodes for best structural spread.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation (Warren/Pratt), symmetry, direct load transfer, and minimal use of heavy area sections minimize both mass and stress-to-weight ratio. Load at node_3 needs short, direct diagonal transfer to both supports. Moving the two top nodes closer to node_3, just above its x-position, reduces diagonal member lengths. Diagonal members handling the most stress (from node_4 downward to supports/load) use area \'2\' or \'3.\' All other members use \'1\' or \'2.\' A top height of ~1.6 (rather than 2.4 or 3.0) keeps total length low for mass and is enough for triangulation. This layout delivers high efficiency and satisfies all constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: \n    1.
