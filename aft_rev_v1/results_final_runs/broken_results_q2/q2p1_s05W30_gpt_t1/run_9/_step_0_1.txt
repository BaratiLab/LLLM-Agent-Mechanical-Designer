The design objective is to minimize the stress-to-weight ratio, producing a closed, statically-determinate truss that strictly obeys stress-to-weight and total mass constraints. Area selections and geometry are tailored to ensure compliance and efficiency.",\n   \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs specify a 3-node base — forming a triangle — with fixed, roller, and loaded nodes. Stress-to-weight must be ≤ 0.5, total mass ≤ 30. Given node positions suggest the shallow triangle risks poor load triangulation. Need to consider adding an internal node for better stability if necessary, else start with a triangle.",\n   \n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 is substantial and angled, so both vertical and horizontal equilibrium are non-trivial. Supports: node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 (roller)—makes node_3 statically determinate in vertical only, but load there creates both vertical and horizontal reactions. If only three nodes, best triangulation is the triangle itself. However, the shape (nodes nearly collinear) makes stress high in some members. Members between node_1–node_2 (6m), node_2–node_3 (4m), node_1–node_3 (2m) allow simple closure. The critical member is likely node_2–node_3 (long span + shares horizontal load); optimize its area.",\n   \n    "scratch_pad_2": "With just three base nodes and all supports specified, forming a triangle truss is efficient and likely to minimize dead weight unless new nodes substantially lower internal forces. However, the stress-to-weight constraint pushes for larger cross-section in heavily loaded members, while minimizing area in lightly loaded ones for weight saving. Aim for minimum mass, then check stress-to-weight. No new node seems necessary.",\n   \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation (using all three supplied nodes) closes the truss with shortest possible connections—efficient for direct load transfer. Assign minimal cross-sections to lightly loaded members. For the longest member (node_2–node_3), assign a larger area to keep peak stress down. As the triangle is shallow, the dominant load path will be from node_3 to the fixed support (node_1). Using the area list, we can pick areas to optimize required properties while keeping the total mass under 30.",\n   \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: E (Young\'s modulus) and density are normalized for stress/weight ratio (area × length = proportional to weight).
