All truss specifications (member connections, areas, additional nodes if needed) must be optimized to meet the requirements.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes mostly colinear on the x-axis. The load at node_3, not at the segment\'s midpoint, will induce bending and potential instability. A simple triangular truss is the minimal connection, but may be suboptimal given the stress-to-weight ratio constraint. Triangulation is key for force path stability.",\n\n    "analysis": "Supports: node_1 (\'pinned\'), node_2 (\'roller\'), node_3 (\'roller\'). This is essentially a simply-supported beam with one applied off-center load; node_3\'s position (2.0, 0.0) is 1/3 from node_1, 1/3 from node_2. The truss must connect all nodes (closed system). The load at node_3 induces vertical and horizontal components (-15, -30). The triangle (node_1, node_2, node_3) is the basic closed truss and the lightest possible. However, a single triangle would carry high stresses, particularly across member node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2 due to the off-diagonal load. Member areas should be chosen to keep maximum member stress down while minimizing total weight.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "No out-of-plane load, so all forces can be carried by the in-plane triangle. Each member will be in either tension or compression due to the general off-center load. The main issue is transferring the vertical and horizontal components of the force safely to the two supports. Distributing forces requires that member areas are adjusted: thinner where forces are small (e.g., node_1-node_2), thicker where large (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2). The stress-to-weight ratio is minimized when heavily loaded members are given more area, thinner members where possible, but total area (mass) must be minimized as well.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Using only the three given nodes ensures full closure and minimal mass. Adding nodes is unnecessary as the configuration is statically determinate; more nodes would only increase mass within the given constraints. For force equilibrium: use the method of joints to compute member forces, bearing in mind the load at node_3 and the differing support conditions. Assign largest allowable area to the most stressed member and smallest to lightly loaded members. This balances minimizing max(abs(stress)) and mass. Achieving stress-to-weight ratio ≤1.0 likely requires matching member areas closely to the maximum force in each member, while minimizing unnecessary member size elsewhere.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume E=1 for normalized stress calculation.

Since all are colinear, and all supports are at y=0, load is shared half by each. To determine real member force: \\n Summing moments about node_1 for vertical equilibrium: \\n (6-2) * -30 = 4 * Reaction_at_2 => Reaction_at_2 = -120/4 = -30. \\n For Fy: \\n Reaction_y at node_2 = entire Fy prescribed at node_3, matching support roller in y. \\n For Fx: \\n Only pinned at node_1 resists horizontal: Reaction_x at node_1 = -15. \\n Thus, member forces primarily vertical in node_3-node_1 and node_3-node_2. \\n Using vector statics at node_3 yields: \\n Both member_13 and member_23 carry a component of Fx and Fy each; the triangle at (2,0) implies that all applied load must pass into the two horizontal members. \\n The maximum force occurs in either member node_1-node_3 or node_3-node_2: hypothesize due to high vertical component, largest force in member node_3-node_2. \\n Compute force in member node_3-node_2 using vector projection and solve for axial force: \\n Member_13: length = 2, area=0.782, stress = abs(force)/area. Member_23: length=4, area=0.782. member_12: likely negligible force (no vertical load, only carries moment, short-circuiting node_3). \\n Calculate total mass: mass = (2+4+6)*0.782 = 9.384. \\n Estimate force (F) in member_3-2 under max load is ~sqrt(15^2+30^2)=33.54 (all load carried by one member, conservative upper bound). Stress = 33.54/0.782 = 42.91, stress-to-weight ratio = 42.91/9.384 = 4.57 > 1.0, exceeds constraint. \\n Increase member_3-2 area to area_id=\'6\' (area=7.037): mass = (2*0.782)+(4*7.037)+(6*0.782) = 2.29+28.15+4.69=35.13 (>30).

Assign area_12 and area_13 as \'0\' (area=1) to further reduce mass: mass = (6*1)+(2*1)+(4*3.128)=6+2+12.512=20.51. Stress in member_12 = negligible. Check for potential buckling (but areas are >1 so safe). \\n Hence, optimal member areas: member_13=\'0\', member_23=\'4\', member_12=\'0\'.
