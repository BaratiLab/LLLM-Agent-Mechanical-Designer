The design must minimize the stress-to-weight ratio (not exceeding 1.0), keep total weight under 30, and connect all nodes using only permissible member area IDs, adhering to all boundary/support and load conditions. Areas for new nodes/structural changes are permissible to optimize efficiency.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "There are three given nodes forming a non-colinear geometry: (0,0), (6,0), (2,0). Node 1 is pinned, node 2 is roller, node 3 is roller, and node 3 receives a force of (-15, -30). The minimum closed truss is a triangle connecting all nodes, but this may not best distribute the off-axis load. With only three nodes closely aligned on the x-axis, load transfer paths are not ideal for minimizing stresses. Introducing a fourth node above the x-axis (for triangulation) may improve load resolution and reduce both member length and stress.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Given the excessive downward and leftward load at node 3 and that the triangle nodes are collinear, the traditional truss formed by all three provided nodes will struggle to resolve out-of-plane forces without extremely high member forces (especially compressive/tensile stresses in the longer members). Without triangulation out-of-plane, both stress and weight are likely to be excessive. Placing an additional node above the x-axis (e.g., above node 3 or at the centroid) would provide geometric depth, improve triangulation, effectively transfer the force, and permit using lower area and shorter-length members.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangularization above the x-axis is essential. Placing a fourth node centrally above node 3 (e.g., at (2.5, 2.5)), creates two shorter triangles: one between nodes 1-3-4 and another between 2-3-4, with 1-2-4 closing the loop. This approach should meaningfully reduce peak member stress and limit required areas, controlling total weight and stress/weight ratio. Each member\'s force must be kept below area capacity, particularly those connected to node 3.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Introduce a fourth node above the existing nodes to form two strong, nearly equilateral triangles. The added node centralizes the resolution of the main load and enables direct triangulation to all supports. Critical members are those bearing the major components of the applied load. Choosing the smallest area IDs that sustain member forces, while limiting added mass, is key. Final geometry: node_4 at (2.5, 2.5) (slightly above centroid for symmetry and efficient force transfer). Members: (1-3), (3-2), (2-4), (4-1), (3-4). This closes the structure and efficiently distributes forces.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": [\n        "Assumptions: Members are pin-connected, forces in members are axial only, material yields at 1.0 stress-to-weight ratio, self-weight is proportional to area*length.",\n        "Member loads estimated via static analysis; area_id smallest value that keeps max(abs(stress)) <= area provided.",\n        "Tentative geometry: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (2.5,2.5).",\n        "Primary forces will occur in members connected to node_3.",\n        "Use trigonometry to compute member lengths:",\n        "len_13 = sqrt((2-0)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 2.0",\n        "len_23 = sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 4.0",\n        "len_14 = sqrt((2.5-0)^2 + (2.5-0)^2) = 3.54",\n        "len_24 = sqrt((6-2.5)^2 + (0-2.5)^2) = 4.30",\n        "len_34 = sqrt((2.5-2)^2 + (2.5-0)^2) = 2.55",\n        "Area ID selections: estimate initial members at id 2, increase for those with highest force if required.",\n        "Total weight: sum (length * area)",\n        "Stress: member force/(area)"\n    ],\n    "calculation": [\n        "Key geometry computed:",\n        "len_13: 2.00",\n        "len_23: 4.00",\n        "len_14: 3.54",\n        "len_24: 4.30",\n        "len_34: 2.55",\n        "Area values from area IDs: {\'0\':1, \'1\':0.195, \'2\':0.782, \'3\':1.759, \'4\':3.128, ...}, select \'2\' (0.782) as initial guess.",\n        "Total tentative mass = (2.00+4.00+3.54+4.30+2.55) * 0.782 = 12.59 (well within the 30 max).",\n        "Estimate member forces (using method of joints or direct equilibrium):",\n        "- Due to strong downward/leftward load at node 3, members 3-4 and (likely) 1-3/2-3 take substantial force.",\n        "- As all members similar length/area, and mass is well under max, simulate peak member force as approximately sqrt((-15)^2 + (-30)^2) = 33.54.
