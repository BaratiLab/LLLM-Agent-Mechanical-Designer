The present design (iteration 5/25) satisfies all constraints (stress-to-weight ratio 0.4834, total mass 14.93), but further minimization of stress-to-weight ratio is sought while keeping structure mass under 30.0. No nodes with supports or loads may be moved. Use only allowed area_ids.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Current status: The structure is feasible and inside the constraints. Best historic design is current one with stress-to-weight ratio 0.4834 and mass 14.93. Lower mass designs increase stress-to-weight ratio past limit. Heavier designs offer only marginal gains in stress-to-weight ratio but break mass constraint, so further reducing mass likely increases stress too far.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The structure is currently a closed system with efficient triangulation: nodes 4 and 5 are placed above span and connect via short, direct members to all supports and node 3. The extreme load on node 3 is distributed across multiple members, especially member_1 (node_1—node_3), where max stress occurs (-7.22). Load paths are direct, force is shared by several redundant members, and mass is not wasted. Attempts to press area lower on highly-stressed members result in constraint violations (historical evidence in generations 2 and 3). Attempts to add more material (via larger area_id or more distant nodes) raise mass without efficient stress-to-weight improvement.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Reviewing the geometry, node placement and member layout are already close to optimal given fixed supports and loaded node (nodes cannot move). Current design leverages redundancy, and all nodes contribute to triangulation. Member_1 (node_1—node_3) is the most heavily loaded and uses the largest allowed area without excessive mass penalty. Minor geometry tweaks (like raising/lowering node_4 or node_5) in past generations led to constraint violation. Changing cross-sections to heavier sizes increases mass more than it reduces relative stress.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Retain current node positions for supports and loaded node. Propose minor adjustment: Move node_4 slightly left and node_5 slightly higher and left to slightly even out member lengths and angles, aiming for more balanced stress distribution and slightly reduced max member stress on member_1. Keep area_ids unchanged but check if area_id of member_2 and member_3 could be reduced while keeping stresses under control. All nodes remain part of a single, closed system. If the resulting change does not improve the stress-to-weight ratio or jeopardizes constraints, keep current optimal design and stop.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Maximum efficiency is achieved when force paths are shortest while all members are engaged in triangulation for stiffness and redundancy. With nodes 1, 2, and 3 fixed, moving node_4 slightly closer to node_1 and node_5 upward spreads force more evenly among triangulating members. A slightly higher node_5 could help share vertical load while keeping mass about the same, possibly reducing peak stress. Geometry must remain closed; no nodes can be removed. Small tweaks rather than radical design changes are justified since radical departures (see history) either increase mass or break constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume all support and loaded node positions fixed. Adjust node_4 to [2.6, 3.1] (slightly left), node_5 to [1.85, 2.45] (slightly higher and left). Verify that all members connecting these nodes are similar in length and make angles approaching 60–75° across the loaded span. Calculate new member lengths, total estimated mass (using Euclidean distances and areas), and estimate stress sharing (member_1, member_3, member_4, etc.). Ensure no single member sees substantial stress increase. If total stress-to-weight ratio is not improved or increases, revert to previous best.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Recalculate member lengths:\n    - member_1: node_1 (0, 0) — node_3 (2, 0): 2.00 (unchanged)\n    - member_2: node_2 (6, 0) — node_3 (2, 0): 4.00 (unchanged)\n    - member_3: node_1 (0,0) — node_4 (2.6, 3.1): √(2.6² + 3.1²) ≈ 4.04\n    - member_4: node_2 (6,0) — node_4 (2.6,3.1): √((6-2.6)² + 3.1²) ≈ √(11.56 + 9.61) ≈ 4.53\n    - member_5: node_1 (0,0) — node_5 (1.85, 2.45): √(3.4225 + 6.0025) ≈ 2.99\n    - member_6: node_2 (6,0) — node_5 (1.85,2.45): √(17.2225 + 6.0025) ≈ 4.51\n    - member_7: node_3 (2,0) — node_5 (1.85,2.45): √(0.0225 + 6.0025) ≈ 2.45\n    - member_8: node_4 (2.6,3.1) — node_5 (1.85,2.45): √(0.5625 + 0.4225) ≈ 0.98\n    - member_9: node_3 (2,0) — node_4 (2.6,3.1): √(0.36 + 9.61) ≈ 3.18\n    All members keep area_id from most efficient configuration: member_1 and member_2: \'3\'; rest: \'1\'.\n    Estimated new total mass = sum(length * area) ≈ (2*1.759*2+4.04*0.195+4.53*0.195+2.99*0.195+4.51*0.195+2.45*0.195+0.98*0.195+3.18*0.195) ≈ 14.6 (very close to before)\n    Relative length adjustments will allow more even stress sharing, particularly in member_1, member_3, and member_7.
