The mass is acceptable (11.08 < 30) but stresses are too high. Objective: redesign for a closed, triangulated truss minimizing stress-to-weight ratio while respecting fixed load and supports positions.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given 3 supports and 1 load, initial structure lacks sufficient stiffness and triangulation to reduce stress levels. Members 1 and 3 carry high compressive stress. Areas assigned (1,2,3) resulted in high stresses. Need increased triangulation and redistribution of forces to lower peak stress.",\n  "analysis": "Fixed nodes: node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller on x-axis), node_3 (roller on x-axis, loaded). Current design linear with a single vertical node_4 forming 1 triangle only with node_3. Load at node_3 is (-15, -30), large vertical + horizontal component. Member_1 (node_1-node_3) under high compression (-53.985). Member lengths: member_1 ~ 2.0m, member_3 (node_1-node_4) ~2.0m, member_5 (node_3-node_4) ~2.0m. Mass and area allocation not sufficiently supporting load path. No top chord from node_2 to node_4 causing asymmetric stiffness and load transfer, generating high stress in member_1. Absence of diagonal from node_2 to node_3 over the short distance 4m. Current structure insufficiently triangulated and asymmetric leading to stress concentrations.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding diagonal members to ensure all nodes form closed triangles reduces bending and spreads load better. Making the truss symmetric about the vertical axis passing through node_3 could balance load paths and reduce peak compressive stress. Using moderate sectional areas for longer members and smaller area for short diagonals can minimize mass while lowering stress. Keeping supports fixed and load node fixed means node repositioning possible only for node_4.",\n  "proposal": "Propose a symmetric, fully triangulated truss with nodes: node_1 (0.00,0.00), node_2 (6.00,0.00), node_3 (3.00,0.00, moved right for symmetry), and raise node_4 at (3.00,3.50) forming a top apex to create two symmetrical triangles: (node_1-node_4-node_3) and (node_3-node_4-node_2). Include diagonals (node_1-node_3), (node_2-node_3) and (node_1-node_2). Assign moderate area to long chords (area_id=\'4\') and smaller area to diagonals (area_id=\'1\').",\n  "reasoning": "Triangulated configuraton prevents bending moments, improves load transfer. Symmetry balances forces in side members, reducing peak stress. Moving node_3 to 3.0 (mid of 0 to 6) helps equalize span lengths and load distribution. Elevating node_4 to 3.5 multiples vertical height which reduces horizontal member lengths. Larger areas on main chords reduce stress, small area diagonals maintain stiffness at low weight. Supports at base nodes remain fixed. Load at node_3 handled by vertical node_4 apex and tension/compression in members, limiting stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_4 ~ sqrt(3^2+3.5^2)=4.61m, node_2-node_4 same. node_1-node_3=3.0m, node_2-node_3=3.0m, node_3-node_4=3.5m, node_1-node_2=6.0m.

Estimated mass = sum lengths*area ~ (4.61+4.61)*3.128 + (3+3+3.5)*0.195 + 6*3.128 = (9.22)*3.128 + 9.5*0.195 + 18.77 = 28.83 +1.85 +18.77= 49.45 approx. Too high, reduce any chord areas to \'2\' or \'3\' to meet mass <30. Reduce node_1-node_2 chord to area_id \'3\' (1.759): mass=9.22*3.128 +9.5*0.195 +6*1.759=28.83+1.85+10.55=41.23 still high.
