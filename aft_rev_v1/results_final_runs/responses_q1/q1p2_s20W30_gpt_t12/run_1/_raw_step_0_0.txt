The primary goal is a closed, connected structure of minimal stress and mass while satisfying max stress (|20|) and total mass (≤30) constraints, selecting from given area_IDs. New nodes may be added for triangulation if structurally justified.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Initial system: nodes at (0,0), (6,0), and (2,0). Supports are pinned and roller at ends, load acts downwards left at node_3 (2,0). No original member layout is defined. Must create a truss of minimal mass, closed path, and low member stress. Triangulation is likely necessary for stability. Consider introducing a node above to increase stiffness under the diagonal load.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Given two supports at the bottom span and a single downward-diagonal load at node_3 (center-bottom), the simplest truss is a triangle; however, this shape\'s members align with poor force distribution from the inclined load—leading to inefficient stress. The load\'s direction (left and down at 45°) produces both vertical and horizontal demand. Improved load sharing and better force paths are likely if a top node is added—roughly above the mid-span—permitting triangulation and an efficient two-truss system. All nodes must be connected. The load is best resolved into the longer upper compression member and two shorter tension members.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key issue is ensuring no member exceeds ±20 stress and total member mass stays within 30 units. Too slender members may overstress under the severe load; too thick, and the structure exceeds mass limits. For shortest stable design, adding one node (say, node_4) at (3,2.8) offers optimal triangulation and good force spread—placing the peak above the roughly equilateral triangle covering the original supports. Triangulating via members (\'node_1\'-\'node_4\', \'node_2\'-\'node_4\', \'node_3\'-\'node_4\') plus base chords closes the structure. The ratio of cross-section should correspond to estimated member forces—high area for likely compression members, lower for tension/light loaded members, always ensuring stress below 20.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Acknowledge design best practice: use a triangle for minimal and stable structure. Place node_4 roughly at (3,2.8), above the base center, to promote equilateral geometry (favored for uniform force distribution, minimal peak stress, lowest material usage for a given span). Connect every node so no node is left isolated or in a dead-end. Assign cross-sections strategically—largest in the top chord likely in compression, lighter for base and diagonal \'bracing\' in tension. Calculations of axial forces dictate minimal required area_id per member.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Material is ideal (FoS already included). Statically determinate system—simple truss analysis (joint method or equilibrium). Angles and lengths: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), new node_4 (3,2.8). Key members: base (\'node_1\'-\'node_2\'), base left (\'node_1\'-\'node_3\'), base right (\'node_2\'-\'node_3\'), left upper (\'node_1\'-\'node_4\'), right upper (\'node_2\'-\'node_4\'), central diagonal (\'node_3\'-\'node_4\'), closing all triangles. Node_3 loaded at -10 (N) at -45°. Calculate lengths, force angles, decompose load, analyze each member\'s force via equilibrium; select area_id so forces / area ≤ 20, minimize summing bad areas to avoid mass excess. Use larger area for heavily compressed top member, minimal for base/tension. Mass = ∑(length × area). Epsilon added to coordinates for float formatting.",\n    \n    "calculation": "1.

Forces: The downward/leftward force applies largest demand into member \'3-4\', pulling (tension), propagates via top compression member (\'1-4\', \'2-4\') and bottom ties (\'1-3\', \'2-3\', \'1-2\'). Static equations assign member force via projection. Solve for all joint equilibrium via method of joints.\\n4. Cross-sectional selection: From case, maximum member force for such geometry (scaling with load magnitude and member angle) probably in \'2-4\'/\'1-4\' compressive top chords, ~max~10 N compression for each; assume starting cross-section area_id=\'2\' (0.782) for diagonal/top, area_id=\'1\' (0.195) for base, unless forced otherwise. Trial calculation:\\n   - For max anticipated force 12 N, A req = 12/20 = 0.60 ⇒ area_id=\'2\' supplied.\\n   - Trial masses: member_mass=sum(length × area). 4.22×0.782 + 4.22×0.782 + 6.00×0.195 + 2.93×0.195 + 2.00×0.195 + 4.00×0.195 ≈ (3.30 + 3.30 + 1.17 + 0.57 + 0.39 + 0.78) ≈ 9.51 < 30.\\n5.
