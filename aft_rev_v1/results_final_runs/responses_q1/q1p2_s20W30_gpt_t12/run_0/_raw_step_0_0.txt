Nodes, loads, support types, and a limited discrete set of cross-sectional areas are provided. New nodes may be introduced, except at existing positions of supports and load. The major challenge: ensure direct and efficient load paths while creating a single closed truss with minimal material.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "We start with 3 aligned nodes: 0.0,0.0 (pinned), 6.0,0.0 (roller), 2.0,0.0 (load at -10N @ -45°). Need a closed structure; a triangle is minimal and effective. To better direct load towards supports and provide triangulation, an upper node can be introduced to enable stable, lightweight configuration with all nodes connected.",\n    \n    "analysis": "With all points lying on the x-axis, a triangular configuration using a fourth node above the x-axis is essential for closure and effective load transfer—triangulation prevents mechanisms under off-axis load. Placing an additional node above node_3 symmetrically spreads the load and provides shortest load paths to supports, keeping structure light and stresses balanced. The risk of buckling/compressive overload informs use of adequate member size. The downward-left load on node_3 will primarily propagate to both supports via new diagonals.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "We must add another node (say, node_4) at suitable y > 0, roughly symmetric wrt node_3 for minimal member lengths and force balance. Members: triangle bottom (node_1-node_2), two sides each rising to node_4, link across (node_2-node_3), direct links up to node_4. For min mass and stress, limit side lengths, use smallest acceptable area where possible. Opening the triangle with members to node_3 ensures stability at the loaded node.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangular and braced shapes efficiently distribute load. Adding node_4 above at, e.g., (3.00, 2.50) centrally between supports provides near-equal geometry to both supports and load transfer, easing member stresses. This also shortens member lengths and allows force vectors to be resolved efficiently. Members: (node_1-node_2), (node_1-node_4), (node_2-node_4), (node_3-node_4), and (node_1-node_3), (node_2-node_3) to close—cover all three ground nodes with both upper tie and bottom bracing.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Material has uniform modulus (irrelevant for stress/min mass as per constraint). Maximum member force occurs diagonally from node_3 to both node_1/2 or node_4. Use geometry/trigonometry to estimate lengths (e.g., sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)). Mass = sum(area * length). Initial pass: set minimal areas for least-loaded members, increase as needed for those most loaded (estimated via geometry and free-body analysis for -10N @ -45°). Assign max allowable stress for small cross-sectional areas to minimize mass until constraint is nearly met.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Geometric setup—nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0); node_4 tentatively at (3.00, 2.50). Member lengths: (1-2):6.0, (1-3):2.0, (2-3):4.0, (1-4):sqrt(9+6.25)=3.90, (2-4):sqrt(9+6.25)=3.90, (3-4):sqrt(1+6.25)=2.69. Assigning load transfer: most off-axis load should go through node_4 and be resolved at node_1 & node_2. Highly loaded members (e.g., node_3-node_4, node_4-node_1/node_2) take approx sqrt(2)*5N ≈ 7.07N, rough check puts simplest area at 0.782 (area_id:2 ha/sigma = 7.07/0.782 ≈ 9.05 but max stress 20 --> on safe side with this area!). Recompute mass: 6*0.195+2*0.195+4*0.195+3.90*0.782*2+2.69*0.782= (filing in).* Correction for redundant areas: Use area_id \'1\' (0.195) for bottom frame, area_id \'2\' for diagonals and highly-loaded side.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Max stress on any member remains ≤ 20, with selected cross sections adequate for estimated loads. Total mass, with members lengths and area assignments is less than 30. All constraints are respected and a closed truss is formed—every node is part of at least two closed triangles.
