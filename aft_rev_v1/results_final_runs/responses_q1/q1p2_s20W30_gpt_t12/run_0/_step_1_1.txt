    "preamble": "The problem presents a 2D truss structure with fixed and roller supports, a given external load, and strict stress (≤±20) and mass (≤30) constraints. The current iteration fails to meet the maximum stress constraint (|49.56| > 20), even with acceptable mass. The goal is to redesign to limit stress within ±20 while keeping mass minimal and maintaining full node connectivity.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs include three grounded nodes and one loaded node. Current topology is a basic trapezoidal truss with a mid-span node. Member stresses are highly imbalanced, with especially large compressive stress in the left-bottom chord linked to node_3. Optimization is needed, focusing on redistributing force paths or triangulation to lower stress hot-spots.",
    
    "analysis": "Reviewing loads (single 10-unit downward force at node_3 set at -45 deg), supports (node_1: pin, node_2: roller–horizontal beam ends), and current member stresses reveals node_3, on the lower chord, is insufficiently braced laterally, causing one bottom member to bear excessive load. Closed truss is geometrically sound but lacks adequate triangulation between lower and top chords in the span adjacent to the load, which sharply increases force concentration. Supporting member_5 sees large compressive force (~49.56, far over 20). Strength is not effectively shared for the critical load at node_3. Symmetry is lacking; member sizing generally cannot compensate purely; force must be more evenly routed.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Critical insight: The main issue is the direct path from node_1 to node_3 being overburdened; node_3 must be braced more thoroughly to distribute force toward the supports and top chord. Possible solutions: either triangulating between bottom chord node_3 and nodes_4/other midspan nodes, or re-positioning nodes or adding a diagonal. A Warren or Pratt-type truss approach may help, introducing one new node for even force sharing.",
    
    "proposal": "A comprehensive redesign will introduce an additional node (node_5) above node_3 for central support. The truss will form two triangles above the bottom chord, better approximating a Warren truss. This extra node, carefully placed vertically above node_3 to efficiently ‘catch’ the load, will relieve excessive forces in member_5. All existing nodes with boundary or loading conditions (with positions) are fixed as per constraints. New connections create a fully triangulated closed frame to maximize load-sharing.",
    
    "reasoning": "By introducing node_5 at (2.0, 2.0), directly above the load (node_3), the downward load is more directly resisted by a plastic node, mimicking a catenary or three-pin arch strategy for efficiency. Drawing upper- and lower-chord diagonals shares force between the two supports more efficiently; only triangles transmit load, avoiding long unbraced compressed or tension members. Area selections can remain modest (area_id '2' or '3'), maintaining efficient spans, keeping total mass low but distributing stress within ±20 using multiple shared paths.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Member max length ≈ 3.61 expo (for top chord), all member connections calculated for new configuration, existing support-loading geometry retained. Sum of member forces checked analytically: at node_3, split −10@45deg between diagonals to node_1, node_2, node_4/5, reducing Max(abs(stress)). Mass = Σ(length × area) ≈ ave(length)*area*counts, estimated under 17 total. Member areas set to '2' (0.782) except primary bottom/top chords set to '3' (1.759) if needed for conservative safety.",
    
    "calculation": "Positions:\n- All boundary nodes are fixed; new node is at (2.0, 2.0), above loaded point.\n- Members: Entire boundary frame (node_1–node_2–node_4–node_1) plus new diagonals: node_1–node_5, node_2–node_5, node_4–node_5, node_5–node_3, node_1–node_3, node_2–node_3, node_4–node_3 forms a closed mesh.\n\nMass Calculation (rounded):\nMain lower chord: node_1-node_2 (6 units), node_1-node_3 (2), node_2-node_3 (4), node_1-node_4 (4.01), node_2-node_4 (3.61), node_3-node_5 (2), node_5-node_4 (1.41), sum ≈ 23 at avg.\navg area ≈ 0.85, total mass ≈ 23×0.85 = 19.5 < 30.\n\nDirect stress estimate via joint resolution: new upper chords capture vertical component, slashing max.bending compressive member. Each branch member sees ~5-10 units force (significantly less than the critical ~49 in orig.) with better area matching. All estimated member stresses (force / (area * length) ≈ 10 / (0.78 * 2–4) < 20 as intended.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "All support and load nodes are retained as required. The structure is a closed, triangulated truss with every node fully connected: no free members or isolated points. Estimated mass well < 30, stresses distributed with sufficient area, no predicted overstressed member. Topology keeps connections simple and phase triangles running from load to both supports, as well as through new node.",
