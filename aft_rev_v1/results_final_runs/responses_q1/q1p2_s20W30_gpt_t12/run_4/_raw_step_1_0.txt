The primary goal is a closed (fully connected) truss whose maximum member stress magnitude is ≤ 20 and whose total mass is ≤ 30, choosing from specified cross-sectional areas. Node positions at loads and supports must remain fixed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs are four nodes at fixed positions. Current closed structure distributes a 10kN diagonal load, yet one member\'s compressive stress is -49.56, far over the ±20 allowable. FEM data confirm stress-to-weight inefficiency. Objective is to maintain closure, guarantee strength at lowest feasible mass, and tweak member grouping, sizing, or topology to mitigate over-stression.",\n\n    "analysis": "Analysis reveals that the current diamond/triangular truss aims to triangulate the load at \'node_3\', but the slant of the loading vector and member sizes are not matched to equilibrate forces well—one very slender member (\'member_2\') receives nearly the full force in compression, leading to a vastly excessive negative (compressive) stress. Existing members use minimal area for economy, but do not use thicker sections where needed. All necessary connectivity is present, but suboptimal member sizing and maybe overemphasis on indirect paths (non-direct load-spread) render the stressed members vulnerable. There\'s likely insufficient direct bracing between support and loaded node, leading to peaked stresses in one leg.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The fact that a single member delivers -49.56 suggests a need for a direct force path (bracing, perhaps node position tuning is possible). Larger area usage in the most highly-stressed member would cap stress at 20. Revisiting member sizing—assigning the largest available area to the most loaded member and resizing the lightly-stressed members down—should improve feasibility.",\n\n    "proposal": "Retain overall diamond geometry (minimal nodes, maximal triangulation); upgrade only the over-stressed member\'s cross-sectional area (\'member_2\' between \'node_1\' and \'node_3\'), and modestly upsize its neighboring compression-tension partners as well to limit redistributed overstressing. Leave other member sizes as light as stress allows. Lengths and connections will be preserved to retain the efficient closed shape and symmetry over supports and load.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "The load at node_3 is diagonal and large. Members joining supports directly to node_3 must take high force. To reduce their stresses below ±20, their cross-sectional areas must be selectively increased according to S = F/A, using S ≤ 20. In this classic statically-determinate truss, wider compression/tension chord areas for \'member_2\' and \'member_4\' should ensure stresses reduce without introducing excessive extra mass. No new nodes or longer, heavier sections—just as much mass only as needed in the critical force paths.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume critical member force (originally -49.56) remains ~49.56kN with topology unchanged. Area needed for S=20: F/A→ A = |F|/20 = 49.56/20 = 2.478 square units required. The closest larger discrete area is 3.128 (area_id: \'4\'). Apply this for member_2. Similarly, check member_4 (originally 37.76); A = 37.76/20 = 1.89→ next level: 1.759 (AID: \'3\') or 3.128. Check \'member_1\' (was ~-15.7). Can downsize where possible: A = 15.7/20 = 0.785; use 0.782 (AID: \'2\'). Repeat checks for other members; assign minimal feasible area. Calculate total mass from new area × member lengths; sum for all members.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Key lengths (node_dict positions compute L):\\nmember_2 (node_1–node_3): distance = sqrt((2-0)²) = 2.00 units\\nmember_4 (node_1–node_4): distance = sqrt((3)^2 + (2.5)^2) = sqrt(9+6.25)= sqrt(15.25)=3.905\\nCompute mass for each member: length × assigned area. Simulate redistribution: upsized member_2 drops to max stress 49.56/3.128 = 15.86(<20, OK). Upsized member_4 (if at area 3.128, stress=37.76/3.128=12.08); can use the next smaller (1.759, S=21.48>20), so 3.128 is safe. Neighboring members check for needed reductions.
