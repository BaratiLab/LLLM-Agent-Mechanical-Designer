The objective is to minimize overall mass while ensuring max|stress| ≤ 20 and total mass ≤ 30 kg. Previous designs were overweight and/or overstressed, missing constraint satisfaction. The solution below is focused on feasibility.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given constraints (max|stress| ≤ 20, mass ≤ 30), area choices (1–19.5), and failure under load at node_3, the truss must be restructured for minimal and efficient load paths. Closing the truss and strong triangulation are promising, possibly reducing size or moving nodes to shorten members and lower mass.",\n    \n    "analysis": \n    "Historic failures indicate overreliance on large area factors for stress while ballooning mass, or using small areas and triggering over-stress. Nodes 4 and 5 previously made for excessive member length (heavy) or failed to address stress at critical loaded node_3. Structures with denser triangulation manage force transfer efficiently. Diagonal bracing with a Warren truss (or strongly triangulated Pratt), short, compact triangles around the loaded node, minimize both moments and member lengths. This type of configuration best dissipates -10 kN at node_3 into nodes 1 and 2 via short, efficient load paths, conforming to stress and mass limits.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": \n    "Critical regions remain around node_3, where load is applied, and near supports. To use material efficiently, arrange compact triangles focused around node_3. Limiting top chord height mitigates member lengths and keeps the structure light. Previous area selections (3–4) showed high stress; thus, slightly thicker crucial members at key diagonals with area_id ‘3’ (1.759) or ‘4’ (3.128) and ‘2’ (0.782) for others strikes balance. Using four primary nodes and minimal fifth node directly above node_3 offers compact closure, then assign minimal areas where force is demonstrably low. Avoiding large polygons (pentagons) cap member numbers, concentrating on triangle-and-diagonal schemes.",\n    \n    "proposal": \n    "Redesign the truss. Use five nodes: nodes_1, node_2, node_3 at the original positions (to respect supports and load application requirements); move node_4 upwards to center for compact overhead triangulation, and introduce node_5 if needed for further bracing while eliminating unhelpful overhangs present in previous attempts. Structure members in a near-Pratt/triangulated configuration, emphasizing efficient top and diagonal bracing for node_3. Choose areas carefully to balance tensions and compression, avoiding excess mass. All nodes are interconnected for closure, with triangles preventing any member from excessive tension/compression.",\n    \n    "reasoning": \n    "Symmetric, closely-braced trusses perform well balancing central load. Place node_4 (apex of main triangle) directly over node_3 to allow direct transfer of -10kN into both pinned and roller supports. Connect supports and apex to ensure all loads transfer efficiently. Secondary members (bottom chords and diagonals) induce redundancy and complete closure. Reduce vertical height as much as possible to minimize member length → minimize mass. Apply medium area to main vertical/diagonals, and next smallest feasible to horizontal and secondary diagonals.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": \n    "Assume node_4 at midspan above node_3: node_4 = (3.0, h), with h ~ 2.2–2.4m yields reasonable member angles minimizing length.
