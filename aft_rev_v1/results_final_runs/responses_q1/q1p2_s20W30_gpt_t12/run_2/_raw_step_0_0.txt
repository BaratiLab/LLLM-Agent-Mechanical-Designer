The main objective is to ensure that the Von Mises stresses in all members remain within ±20, and total structure mass (sum of member lengths × sectional areas) remains below 30, thereby achieving both safety and economy.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "We start with nodes node_1 (pinned, 0,0), node_2 (roller, 6,0), and node_3 (loaded, 2,0). To create a closed truss and distribute the given angular load safely, additional node(s) for triangulation will be required. Optimal member cross-sections will minimize mass while satisfying stress limits.",\n\n    "analysis": "The truss must carry a 10kN force at node_3 acting at -45°, supported by node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller—permits horizontal sliding). The three nodes given are collinear, making triangulation (for structural integrity) impossible without added nodes. Thus, optimal design demands at least one node above the x axis to directly resolve the downward and horizontal components. Trusses only with the base nodes would be unstable. The most effective configuration to handle the off-axis load and minimize compressive/tensile stress is a flat-bottomed triangle, with an added node_4 above the base (apex of the triangle). Members should connect all nodes into closed triangles.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "The load, node geometry, and constraints guide us toward adding a high node centrally above the base (midpoint between (0,0) and (6,0)) to minimize member forces. Positioning node_4 at (3, 2.5) is likely effective (this provides a shallow triangle, maximizing vertical angle for force transfer). All nodes must now be fully connected: [node_1, node_2], [node_2, node_3], [node_3, node_1], and all connected to new node_4.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Triangulation is necessary (non-collinear). By adding a node above the midpoint, each base node is tied to apex via diagonals which distribute both forces and moments. The loaded node\'s vertical/horizontal forces pass efficiently into these diagonals. All boundary nodes must be interconnected for closure, with adequate area allocation for load paths most stressed (diagonals from loaded node). Section sizes must be minimized for mass except where stresses are high.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions:\\n- All members pinned at ends.\\n- Material yield = ±20 (stress units match load units/m^2 assumed),\\n- Cross sections: as given; areas selected for each member using calculated required stress.\\nSet-up:\\n1. Determine internal forces for each member using method of joints or section (approximate for symmetry); for key diagonals transfer load.\\n2. Estimate member force = (load magnitude × geometry)\\n3. Select lowest-area_id such that force/area ≤ 20 (allowing lightest possible design).\\n4. Compute member lengths and mass (area × length).\\n5.

Lengths—base: 6.00 m (node_1 to node_2), side legs: ~3.90 m (using Pythagoras: sqrt(3^2+2.5^2)=3.90), base diagonals to node_3 (~2.92 m, from (2,0) to (3,2.5)).\\nStep 2: Calculate load transfer in all diagonals from node_3. As (node_3–node_4) is direct for upward support, expect maximum tension forces here, also moderate thrust to pinned/roller supports.\\nStep 3: Use F=σA ⇒ A = F/σmax.
