Additional nodes can be added (not on existing supports/load nodes), optimal areas (from the area list) must be selected per member, and all nodes must be fully connected (closed truss) with no constraint violations.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Three main nodes lie along a base (two supports) and load applied off-center at node_3. To minimize stress, a triangular/triangulated truss is typically best. With only three provided nodes, structural stability and stress minimization are at odds without additional nodes. Efficient member layout, possibly introducing one apex/top node to form two triangles, would distribute and reduce force in each member; areas must be chosen to barely meet but not greatly exceed required capacity for mass savings.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Nodes: node_1 (pinned, 0,0), node_2 (roller, 6,0), node_3 (free w/load, 2,0). Load magnitude is 10 units at node_3 at -45° (compression+shear downward/left). Classic Warren truss scheme: A new node above the span (increase vertical triangulation), forming triangles by connecting all to the load node, base, and to the new apex. All external nodes lie on the x-axis. Supports suitably spaced for path stability, roller at node_2 provided horizontal movement restraint. Proper member sizing required so no member exceeds ±20 stress. Avoid member redundancy to reduce dead weight. Delaunay-like triangulation is optimal for three base nodes and one apex.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key: stress is critical at lowest area, so set all new members\' areas close to the least needed for < 20 stress. Closed truss definition implies at least 4 nodes (triangle closure impossible for rigid 3-truss under off-axis load). Millennials in triangulation: connect all four nodes for maximum redundancy and closure (even a direct across-diagonal from base to apex). Apex/upper node position must be set to minimize max force—preliminary analysis places it somewhere above/between node_1 and node_2 to smooth force transfer from loaded node_3. Adding node_4 at x ≈ 4.0, y ≈ 2.75 distributes the load and allows optimal redistribution.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Propose node_4 at (4.0, 2.75)—well centered to form two triangles on left and right. Node_4 location chosen along a line towards all three lower nodes, placed according to direction of load for effective load transfer (forms a near-symmetric configuration relative to supports/lib). Members: node_1—node_3, node_1—node_4, node_3—node_4, node_4—node_2, node_3—node_2; forming two full triangles (1-3-4 and 2-3-4) plus base. Each area is optimized for load paths: largest for members likely to take the brunt of the -45 deg load (node_3—node_4), smaller where force is clearly low (base). Every member area is min-sized subject to F≤A*20. There is high redundancy and full closure.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Truss is pin-jointed; area always exactly as needed for the governing member to reach ±20 stress under computed internal forces. All bars steel; unit density for mass calculation (Sum L×A). Statics: Under -45° load at node_3, with triangular closure, key member forces are quickly estimated via vector decomposition. For member areas: Exploit high-efficiency ≈1.0 area on lightly loaded members; size upwards for main diagonal/vertical members accordingly. Identify each member’s length via Pythagorean rule, then F_member determined by simple vector statics (superposition, truss method of joints). Members: base (node_1-node_3-node_2), elevation (node_3-node_4, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4). Assign area_ids from area_lookup sufficient for max F/20.
