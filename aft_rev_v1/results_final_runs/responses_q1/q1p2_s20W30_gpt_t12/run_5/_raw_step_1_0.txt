The objective is to generate a closed truss with all nodes connected, max(abs(stress)) ≤ 20, and mass ≤ 30, optimizing the truss layout and cross-sections.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "The goal is to redesign or optimize a 2D truss supporting a diagonal load at node_3, with supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller), making sure each member\'s |stress| ≤ 20 and total mass ≤ 30. The structure must be closed (every node is structurally integrated). Strategically shape and size members for efficient load transfer and low mass.",\n    "analysis": "The previous layout is a basic 4-node, 5-member configuration—nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), and (4,2.35). Load is -10 kN, -45° (vector: ~(-7.1N, -7.1N)) applied to node_3, which is offset from line between supports—this is inherently destabilizing and creates very high bending and diagonal member forces. Highest absolute stress in the old layout is ~48 (over by ~2.4x). Node_4 sits high, but the load is distinctly off-center, generating large local forces—especially in diagonal/tension members. Fails closure criterion, and member sizing is inefficient: some oversized, others critically stressed.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "The primary issue is overstressing in diagonal or vertical members due to poor triangulation and suboptimal geometry. The truss must resist a non-vertical, off-center load. Common roof/truss-style layouts (triangulated webs, symmetric frame, redundant closing members) improve stress efficiency and redundancy. The best approach is adjusting node_4 for better load triangulation (closer to load transfer), introducing a bottom chord member for closure, and size all members carefully.",\n    "proposal": "Redesign: Shift node_4 farther upward for deeper truss height, add a closing \'bottom chord\' (node_1 to node_2), connect every node with at least two adjoining members, and triangulate between the supports and load node. Replace the midspan node (node_3) at optimal point between supports—in line with the applied force vector—so that load transfer is direct; broaden node_4 for maximum depth. Select smallest cross-sections consistent with constraints, and select largest allowed area only for highly stressed members.",\n    "reasoning": "A statically determinate (or minimally redundant) truss, symmetrical relative to the supports, and with a triangular/deep panel at midspan helps achieve good load distribution and ups closure. In this truss scenario, the ideal is to carry the gentler load lines directly to supports by triangulation. Move node_4 a little higher for depth and longer diagonals to reduce force densities. Add a \'chord\', close off with an extra member \'node_1-node_2\' which for previous truss is missing. Use area choices as stress estimates dictate.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume allowable stress: 20. Calculate estimated forces in diagonals assuming simple triangle equilibrium (project components along member directions: trigonometry on force vector— load at (2,0) distributed to nodes (0,0), (6,0), (4,3.5)). Chord (node_1-node_2) helps structural closure, reducing shear/bending. Estimate member mass = length × area; use lowest area (largest where necessary for heavy members). No change to support or load node locations per rules.",\n    "calculation": "Load at node_3 (2.0,0.0) splits between left and right supports plus node_4. For vertical separation, place node_4 at (3.0, 3.2):\xa0depth ~3.2 over 6 span. \'Bottom chord\': node_1-node_2. Connect node_3 to node_4 and to both supports for direct force flow. Separate major force-carrying diagonals—estimate <20 stress in all (geometry ensures longer inclined members, reducing absolute stress for same force). Sizing: Use 0.782 (area_id \'2\') for chords/major diagonals; use 1.759 (\'3\') for highest-stress member(s), lowest (0.195, \'1\') for lightly loaded links. Compute lengths: e.g., node_1 to node_2 = 6.0m; node_1 to node_4 = sqrt(9+10.24) = ~4.17m, etc. For example, summing mass: "\n                      "6*0.782 (bottom) "\n                      "+ 3*3.2 (left vertical chord) "\n                      "+ 3*3.2 (right inclined chord) "\n                      "+ etc. Total mass remains <30.",\n    "scratch_pad_final": "All supports/loaded nodes keep exact original coordinates. Node_4 moves up and centered to (3.0, 3.2) for deeper truss and better force paths. All nodes are interconnected for closure: a bottom chord,  and two main web diagonals. Apply largest section 1.759 (\'3\') to principal web; lightest legal 0.195 (\'1\') on lesser loaded web members.
