The objective is to minimize stress in all members while ensuring maximum stress magnitude remains within ±20 and total truss mass ≤30, by precisely selecting geometry and cross-sectional areas.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs give three key structural nodes: pinned at (0, 0), roller at (6, 0), loaded node at (2, 0) with a 10kN downward-left (-45°) force. Support types dictate reactions: pinned (node_1) resists both X and Y, roller resists Y. Notably, the three nodes are colinear, so a closed, triangulated system needs additional node(s).",\n\n    "analysis": "For static determinacy and effecient force transfer, truss triangulation is necessary. The load at node_3 (2, 0), with −10\u202fkN at −45°, imposes both X and Y force demand. Two original supports alone cannot form a stable or triangulated structure. Adding a node above the baseline — say at (4, ideal_y) — enables forming two triangles. Choosing an optimal height for this node balances mass vs. lowered member forces; diagonals reduce direct bending and distribute forces through tension/compression alone. Members will naturally direct load to the supports via the chosen geometry. Potential failure modes: tension/compression exceeding area over max stress, or member mass sum exceeding the limit.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Pattern emerges: the most efficient truss (minimum stress per mass) is symmetric, with all members either in direct path of the main load or providing necessary triangulation. With nodes aligned horizontally, introducing a higher node off the line creates typical \'truss arch\' efficiency. Increasing vertical offset decreases force in the diagonals by increasing their mechanical advantage, but weighs against greater member lengths increasing mass.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Introduced node_new1 at (4.0, 2.35) — offset above base to ensure triangulation (forms two triangles). This gathers the load path for node_3 and allows direct connection to both supports for effective force splitting. Keeping the new node symmetrically closer to load node_t (at x=2) and favoring right for minimum triangle height avoids unduly long member lengths, conserving mass. Six members will close (node_1↔node_3↔node_2↔node_new1↔node_1) and direct gusset from node_3↔node_new1, enabling full triangulation. Area allocations favor central members (with direct highest forces, e.g. node_3-to-node_1 and node_3-to-node_2) to be thickest; triangulating arms thinner for mass efficiency.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume node lineup: node_1 (0, 0), node_2 (6, 0), node_3 (2, 0), node_4 (4.0, 2.35). Key members: node_1↔node_3, node_3↔node_2, node_1↔node_4, node_3↔node_4, node_2↔node_4. Loads in each member resolved by static equilibrium: -10\u202fkN at 2,0 with direct triangles. For member stresses: σ=F/A; for total mass sum(L×A). Connectivity ensures members form a closed space with no unsupported node. Based on anticipated force levels (from load at node_3), estimate: (1) members node_1↔node_3, node_3↔node_2 carry highest force (bracing loaded node directly), then diagonals lower. Areas assigned accordingly (area_id 3 or 4 for primary, 1 for diagonals). All lengths systematic: e.g., l13 = ||(2,0)-(0,0)|| = 2.00; l32 = 4.00; l14 = sqrt(4.0²+2.35²) = ~4.62; l24= sqrt(2.0²+2.35²) = ~3.08; l34 = sqrt(2.0²+2.35²) = ~3.08.",\n\n    "calculation": "Compute member forces under single load.

Assuming triangles direct load mostly along nodes 1–3 and 3–2, both must resist large projections of 10 kN; dividing as per truss geometry and carry-over through upper node: for estimation assume main diagonal shares (7,7) kN, diagonal via upper node ~3 kN. Assign central members area_id \'4\' (3.128), triangles \'1\' (0.195). Stress: σ_main = maxF/A_main ≈ 7/3.128 = 2.24 N, well below 20. σ_diag ≈ 3/0.195 = 15.39 (still within 20).
