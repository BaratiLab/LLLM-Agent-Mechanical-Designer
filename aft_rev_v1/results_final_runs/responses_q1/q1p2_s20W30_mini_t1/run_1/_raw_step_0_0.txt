Supports allow equilibrium reactions. Objective is to minimize stress < ±20 and mass ≤ 30 using selected cross-sectional areas.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes: node_1(0,0,pinned), node_2(6,0,roller), node_3(2,0) with a -10N load at node_3 in -45°. The structure is currently a line which can\'t be closed or stable. Need at least one more node to form a closed, triangulated truss. Constraints include max stress ±20 and mass ≤ 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Linear arrangement is unstable under lateral loads; node_3 is loaded diagonally. Supports provide vertical and horizontal restraint at nodes 1 and 2. To form a closed truss, introduce node_4 above current line. With 4 nodes, form a quadrilateral split by diagonals to ensure triangulation and good load path. Members will share load, reducing stress. Area selection trades off mass and stress capacity.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a node at ~x=4.0, y=3.0 forms a trapezoid with triangulation inside. This adds effective load path for diagonal load at node_3. Choosing moderate area sizes initially to meet stress limits while controlling mass. Members connecting node_3, node_4, and the supports distribute forces well.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangulation of structure ensures stability and force redistribution. Location of node_4 near above node_3 captures load direction influence. Use diagonals node_3-node_4 and node_4-node_2 plus base and links to pinned and roller supports. Choose increasing area trade-offs from bottom chord to diagonals to manage stresses. Use area_ids near mid range except for key tension members which get larger areas.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear-elastic, static equilibrium. Calculate member lengths using distance formula. Forces calculated by resolving vertical and horizontal reactions at supports and internal force equilibrium at nodes. Stress = Force/Area, Mass = sum(length*area). Cross-section areas chosen from given IDs with values representing effective cross-section. Check stress against ±20 and mass ≤ 30.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node_4 at (4.0, 3.0). Members and lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_4 ≈ 3.606, node_4-node_2 ≈ 3.162, node_2-node_1 = 6.0, node_1-node_4 ≈ 5.0, node_3-node_2 ≈ 4.0. Assign area_id \'3\' (1.759) to top chords, \'5\' (4.887) to diagonals for strength, \'2\' (0.782) to bottom chord to reduce mass. Estimated mass ≈ 2.0*0.782 + 3.606*4.887 + 3.162*4.887 + 6.0*0.782 + 5.0*1.759 + 4.0*1.759 ≈ 1.56 + 17.6 + 15.47 + 4.69 + 8.79 + 7.04 = 54ish — too high. Reduce some areas: bottom chords \'1\' (0.195), diagonals \'3\' (1.759), top chord \'2\' (0.782). New mass ≈ 2*0.195 +3.6*1.759 +3.16*1.759 +6*0.195 +5*0.782 +4*0.782=0.39+6.33+5.56+1.17+3.91+3.13=20.5 < 30 and allows stress < 20 with moderate forces.
