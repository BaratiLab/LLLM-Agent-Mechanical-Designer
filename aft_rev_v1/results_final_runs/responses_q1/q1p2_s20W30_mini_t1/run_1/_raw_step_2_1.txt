The optimization goal is to create a closed 2D truss satisfying max stress ≤ ±20 and total mass ≤ 30 while respecting supports and applied loads, without relocating supported or loaded nodes.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given load at node_3 downward-left (-10N at 45°), supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller). Current nodes form a pentagonal layout with diagonal members. Stress peaks primarily in member_1 (-57.24). The structure is statically indeterminate with member areas varying from 1 to 3. Triangular sub-elements exist but stress concentration is high in member_1.",\n    "analysis": "Member_1 (node_1 to node_3) bears excessive compressive load (-57.24), likely due to geometry and load transfer path. Existing pentagon-like shape with diagonal bracing is not distributing load efficiently. The largest area members (3, 2) carry moderate load but not enough to relieve stressed member_1. History shows smaller, less complex trapezoidal structures lowered max stress but not below 52, and current complexity only increased mass without stress reduction. Load at node_3 tries to pull structure downward-left, requiring better triangulation and balanced force paths. Current layout\'s openness and slender diagonals likely create high member forces and buckling risks. Supports at ends fix horizontal and vertical positions, so internal force redistribution requires additional triangulation or geometry adjustment to shorten high-stress members or increase redundancy.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Insight: To reduce stress on member_1, either shorten it or add intermediate nodes creating stronger triangulated substructures transferring load through multiple members. Reducing member length and increasing member areas strategically on compression members will reduce stress. Symmetry in vertical plane and closed loop geometry will ensure stable, redundant load paths. Node_5 position and member_2-3-5 interplay needs review — possibly merging node_4 and node_5 to simplify. Maximum stress reduction is achievable by increasing cross-sectional area on heavily loaded members while lowering overall mass by removing underutilized or inefficient members.",\n    "proposal": "Redesign the structure into a strong closed quadrilateral with triangulated diagonals. Keep nodes 1 and 2 fixed (supports), retain node_3 load position, reposition node_4 to improve triangulation and remove node_5 for simplicity and mass saving. Propose a trapezoid with bottom nodes 1-3-2 and top node_4 elevated to form robust triangles with diagonal braces. Members: bottom chord 1-3-2, top chord 4-1-2, diagonals 3-4 and 4-2 for rigidity and force distribution. Use area_ids to assign large sections to high compression/tension members (esp. 1-3, 3-4), smaller areas to less critical.",\n    "reasoning": "Principles: Triangulation prevents mechanism collapse and distributes load. Axial forces better balanced by triangle members reduce max stress. Shorter compression members allow lower area to achieve strength. Node_4 raised to 3.5m provides leverage. Remove node_5 to reduce complexity and mass. Area selection is driven by member length and estimated axial force: largest areas for short, high stress members (e.g., 1-3), moderate for diagonals, smallest for chords parallel to supports. Load at node_3 pushes towards node_1 and node_2; diagonals and vertical chords enable vertical and horizontal reaction force transfer. Supports constrain displacement and rotation at node_1 and rolling at node_2, ensuring statical determinacy.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic behavior, uniform stress along each member. Force equilibrium in horizontal (∑Fx=0) and vertical (∑Fy=0) at each node. Basic trigonometric calculation for member lengths and angles. Member stress = axial force / area. Mass = sum(member length × area). Use areas from area_id with values: 0:1, 1:0.195, 2:0.782, 3:1.759, etc. Calculations aim for max stress ≤ 20, total mass ≤ 30. Use large area for short critical members, smaller area for longer less stressed. Node coordinates chosen to minimize member length but ensure triangulation.",\n    "calculation": "Nodes: node_1 (0.00, 0.00) pinned; node_2 (6.00, 0.00) roller; node_3 (2.00, 0.00) load; node_4 (3.00, 3.50) relocated higher for better triangulation. Members and lengths: member_1(1-3): 2.00m; member_2(3-4): sqrt((3-2)^2 + (3.5-0)^2)= ~3.04m; member_3(4-2): sqrt((6-3)^2 + (0-3.5)^2)= ~4.30m; member_4(2-1): 6.00m; member_5(1-4): sqrt((3-0)^2 + (3.5-0)^2)=4.30m.

Calculate approx axial forces based on load and equilibrium: assume member_1 takes large compression, member_4 small tension, diagonals moderate axial force. Estimated max axial force ~20 units translates to stress ≤20 due to chosen areas. Mass = sum(length*area): m1=6.256, m2=5.33, m3=3.36, m4=1.17, m5=7.56 total ~23.65 < 30.
