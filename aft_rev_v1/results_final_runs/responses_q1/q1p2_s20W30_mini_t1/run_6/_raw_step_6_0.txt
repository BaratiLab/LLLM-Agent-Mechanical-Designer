The current design violates max stress (3.51 < 20 allowed) but exceeds mass limit (56.8 > 30). Optimization objective is to create a feasible closed truss under constraints: max stress ≤ ±20 and total mass ≤ 30, minimizing stress and weight.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given structure has 5 nodes with internal complex triangulation, stress max 3.51 is acceptable but mass is too high. Prior designs show attempts varying node 4\'s height, member areas, and member connectivity. Failures stem mainly from excess mass and some overstress in specific members. The load is concentrated at node_3 with diagonal downward-left force.",\n\n    "analysis": "The supports and load induce bending moment and axial forces primarily around node_3 and nodes adjacent. Current 5-node design creates multiple load paths but member areas are too large leading to mass excess. Lowering members\' areas risks overstress. Historical data shows simpler 4-node trusses have large overstress, complicated 5-node sometimes succeeds. Node_5 may be redundant and increase weight without beneficial stress distribution. A symmetric, equilateral triangular or trapezoidal closed geometry with 4 nodes with carefully chosen cross-sections is preferred. Member connectivity must ensure stiffness (triangulation) and transfer load efficiently from node_3 to supports without overloading any single member. The pinned and roller supports constrain vertical and horizontal reactions adequately for statics.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Eliminate node_5 and reduce node_4 complexity. Focus on 4-node trapezoidal truss with diagonal members for triangulation. Cross-section areas must be selected from given area_id set, balancing stress and mass. Symmetry reduces bending eccentricities and helps distribute forces evenly. Use lower area_ids on less stressed members and increased areas on compressive/tensile members that see higher forces. Node_3 at bottom is loaded, nodes 1 and 2 at base support, node_4 elevated to transfer loads. This satisfies boundary and load conditions and keeps geometry compact to limit member length.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign truss with 4 nodes: node_1 and node_2 at base, node_3 at loaded base location, node_4 elevated approx 3.5m vertically at center. Members: base chord (node_1-node_2), two diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4), two verticals (node_3 to node_1 and node_3 to node_2), and top chord (node_3-node_4). Assign cross-sections to keep stresses ≤ 20 and mass ≤ 30. This symmetric trapezoid closed truss ensures efficient load path, minimal stress concentrations, and reduced mass.",\n\n    "reasoning": "A symmetric trapezoidal truss with triangulation minimizes bending moments and spreads load from node_3 to supports. The elevated node_4 provides vertical stiffness. Nodes at base fixed supports anchor structure. Members are sized according to expected axial forces, with shorter diagonals and chords using smaller cross-sections. Triangulation ensures no mechanism under load. Node_3 load distributed via vertical and diagonal members, achieving equilibrium with minimized member stress. Using area_id 2~4 mostly balances mass and strength. Member length calculated by Euclidean distance. Mass is sum of length × area density from area_id table. Stress estimated from axial force / area, axial force estimated by static equilibrium and trigonometric decomposition.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Load only at node_3 is 10N at -45°. Supports fix node_1 (pinned: both directions), and node_2 (roller: vertical only). Member lengths from node coords. Calculate member forces by statics: sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, sum Moments=0. Use symmetric load path to infer equal axial forces in diagonal members. Member area assigned to limit stress ≤ 20. Mass = sum(length * area_density). Areas chosen from area_id mapping: {\'0\':1, \'1\':0.195, \'2\':0.782, \'3\':1.759, \'4\':3.128, \'5\':4.887,...} Pick mostly area_id \'2\' (0.782) or less for light members, \'3\' (1.759) for high load members. Node coordinates fixed for supports and load nodes, others adjustable for geometry and efficient load transfer.",\n\n    "calculation": "Node coords: node_1(0.00,0.00), node_2(6.00,0.00), node_3(2.00,0.00) fixed.

Using static equilibrium and symmetry, estimate forces: Vertical reactions split between node_1 and node_2 supports; axial forces in diagonals ~3-4N. Assign area_id \'3\' (1.759) to diagonals to reduce stress; area_id \'2\' (0.782) to chords and verticals for mass saving. Calculate mass: sum(length*area_density) ≈ (6*0.782)+(4.61*1.759)*2+(2*0.782)+(4*0.782)+(3.64*0.782)=4.692+16.207+1.564+3.128+2.846=28.44 ≤ 30. Axial stresses estimated below 20 in magnitude.
