Objective is to minimize stress and mass within constraints while ensuring all nodes form a closed, stable truss.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes form a nearly linear layout along x-axis with node_3 offset at (2,0). Load of 10 units at -45° at node_3 requires load path transfer to pinned node_1 and roller node_2. Max stress ±20 and total mass ≤30 constrain area choices and member lengths. Initial truss is open (line of 3 joints), so closure by adding nodes/members needed for triangulation and stability.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The load at node_3 (-10 at -45°) generates tension/compression in members connecting node_3 to supports. Without diagonal bracing, the truss will be unstable. A triangular topology is ideal: nodes 1-2-3 + an added upper node (node_4) creating two triangles for rigidity. Node_4 vertically above node_3 near 3 units height will create equilateral or near-equilateral triangles, minimizing member length and stress. Supports at node_1 and node_2 fix displacements preventing rigid body modes. Stress central in diagonal members carrying load directly. Using higher area sections for critical diagonals and smaller areas for horizontal chords saves mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "A closed triangle formed by nodes 1-3-4 and 2-3-4 splits forces effectively, transferring node_3 load. Using node_4 at about (2.0, 3.0) enables direct triangular bracing. The member lengths are moderate (~3-4 units), and total mass should stay under 30 if low areas used for horizontal chords and medium areas for diagonals. Stress estimates will rely on load distribution and axial force calculation from simple statics.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Introduce node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) forming two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4 to close structure. Use area_id \'4\' (3.128) for diagonals (high load), area_id \'1\' (0.195) for horizontal members to minimize mass. This triangulation harnesses load paths efficiently with direct load transfer and minimal bending. Member length and stress remain low and within constraints. No nodes moved except new node_4; supports and loads fixed per instructions.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Truss members carry axial load only. Stress = Force / Area. Area in abstract units relates linearly to stress capacity. Mass = sum(length × area). Calculate member lengths via distance formula. Use basic statics: sum of vertical and horizontal forces = 0 at node_3. Maximum stress limit ±20 corresponds to maximum force in member divided by area ≤ 20. Calculate force in diagonal members by resolving load vector (-10 at -45° ~ -7.07 x and -7.07 y components). For conservative estimates, member forces in diagonals ~7.07. Use areas to keep stress ≤ 20. Total mass must be checked summing lengths × areas.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1(0,0)-node_3(2,0): 2.0 units; node_3-node_2(6,0): 4.0 units; node_3-node_4(2,3): 3.0 units; node_1-node_4: sqrt((2-0)^2+(3-0)^2)=3.606 units; node_2-node_4: sqrt((6-2)^2+(0-3)^2)=5.0 units. Assign areas: diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4) area_id \'4\'(3.128), horizontals (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2) area_id \'1\'(0.195). Mass = sum(length×area): (3.606+5.0+3.0)*3.128 + (2.0+4.0)*0.195 = (11.606)*3.128 + (6.0)*0.195 = 36.3 + 1.17 = 37.47 > 30 (too high). Reduce diagonal area to \'2\'(0.782): mass = 11.606*0.782 + 6*0.195 = 9.07 + 1.17 = 10.24 < 30 (satisfies). Stress check: max axial force ~7.07, stress = force/area = 7.07 / 0.782 = 9.04 < 20 (safe). For horizontal members, axial force is lower (support reactions balanced), so area \'1\' is acceptable. All constraints satisfied.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_final": "Design uses 4 nodes (original 3 + 1 new at (2.0, 3.0)) forming two triangles for stability.
