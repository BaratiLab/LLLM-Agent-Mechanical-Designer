Objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss with given supports and loads to satisfy max stress ≤ 20 and mass ≤ 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given a 4-node truss loaded at node_3 with a force of magnitude 10 at -45°, supported pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current design has mass 33.39 and max stress 15.57 but violates mass ≤ 30. History shows attempts to reduce stress increased mass significantly, or introduced extra nodes without full constraint satisfaction.",\n  "analysis": "Current structure is a trapezoidal shape with a diagonal member connecting loaded node_3 to apex node_4. Load is downward-left diagonal force at node_3. Members near node_3 have highest stresses (up to -15.57). Mass is dominated by long members with large cross sections. The structure is stable but bulky. Prior histories either increased mass or max stress. The main difficulty is balancing small member cross-sections to reduce mass but large enough to keep stress under 20. Additionally, node_4 placement and cross-sections need tuning to improve load distribution and reduce peak stresses. Closed format means all nodes interconnected. Current members: bottom chord, two diagonals from corners to node_4, and diagonals to node_3. The triangular substructures enhance stiffness.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Load path focuses on transferring diagonal force at node_3 mainly through members connecting to supports (node_1 pinned and node_2 roller). Main tension/compression members are bottom chord, diagonals to node_4, and diagonals involving node_3. Adding a single node near load to distribute stress reduces peak stress but increases mass. Slight repositioning of node_4 upwards and closer to node_3 reduces diagonal lengths and stress. Cross section area selection must balance minimal mass and stress constraints (from area_id choices).",\n  "proposal": "Redesign the 4-node truss with nodes 1,2 fixed; node_3 fixed (load); reposition node_4 up and left closer to node_3 to reduce diagonal lengths. Use a fully triangulated closed loop with bottom chord (node_1-node_2), two diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4), two diagonals connecting node_3 to node_1 and node_4 and to node_2, and cross-member (node_3-node_4) to stabilize. Select minimal areas to satisfy stress constraints and mass ≤ 30. Remove long heavy members. This will spread load better and reduce peak stress and mass.",\n  "reasoning": "Load at node_3 (-10 at -45°) creates tension in bottom chord and compression in diagonals. Triangulation ensures geometric stability and effective load transfer. Moving node_4 to [2.70, 2.25] shortens diagonals reducing member length and mass. Cross-member from node_3 to node_4 provides alternative load path and decreases stress on bottom chord. Cross sectional areas chosen from area_id such that larger areas in high-stress members (near load/supports) and smaller in less stressed members minimize mass while keeping stress < 20.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assume uniform density. Calculate member lengths by Euclidean distance. Calculate forces using statics and resolve components. Stress = force / area. Mass = length × area (assuming unit density). Areas assigned from allowed area_id mapping. Iterate to keep max stress ≤ 20 and mass ≤ 30. Use nodes at fixed positions for supports and loads. Equilibrium equations for nodes enforce zero net force except at loads.",\n  "calculation": "Node positions: node_1 (0.00, 0.00), node_2 (6.00, 0.00), node_3 (2.00, 0.00), node_4 (2.70, 2.25). Member lengths: 1-3=2.00, 3-2=4.00, 4-1 ≈ 3.61, 4-2 ≈ 3.36, 3-4 ≈ 2.50, 1-2=6.00.
