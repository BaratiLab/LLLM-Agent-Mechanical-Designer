  "preamble": "Optimize a 2D truss with 3 given nodes, two supports (one pinned, one roller), and a downward-left load at node_3. The goal is a fully closed structure minimizing stress under ±20 stress limit and total mass ≤30, using predefined area cross sections.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes lie mostly on x-axis: node_1 at (0,0), node_2 at (6,0), node_3 at (2,0) with a -10 force at 45° downward-left. Node_1 is pinned, node_2 is roller: typical boundary for a simply supported beam. Need a closed truss with minimal stress and mass ≤30. Initial members are edges (node_1,node_2), (node_1,node_3), and (node_2,node_3) forming a triangle, but only on the x-axis so far, limiting vertical support. Must add nodes to create vertical stiffness and triangulation for stability.",
  
  "analysis": "Load at node_3 acts diagonally left-down (-10 at 45°). This induces tension/compression primarily in horizontal members and those connected to node_3. With supports at node_1(pinned) and node_2(roller), horizontal reaction will mainly come from node_1. The all-zero-y nodes produce little vertical triangulation, likely causing bending stresses and high stress in members. To reduce stress and create a closed truss, adding at least one node above the x-axis between nodes_1 and 2 is critical. Triangulation will transfer load more effectively and reduce stress in members. Closed truss demands members connect nodes forming at least one cycle—triangulation is simplest. Mass constraint (≤30) suggests member areas should be minimized but strong enough to limit stress.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "To ensure the structure is closed, fully connected, and stiff under applied load, I will add one new node above node_3 around x=2, y>0 (the vertical coordinate). This creates two triangles: (node_1, new_node, node_3) and (node_3, new_node, node_2). This distributes load and allows pull/push forces in short inclined members. Using this triangulated form reduces stress in horizontal members. Selecting area ids that balance strength and mass is next; longer members need slightly larger sections but keep others minimal. Triangulation is effective in load path transfer and reduces bending by turning bending moments into axial forces, minimizing stress. No other nodes or members needed due to problem simplicity.",
  
  "reasoning": "Add node_4 at approx (2.0, 3.0) to form two triangular panels. Connect node_4 to node_1, node_2, and node_3. Members: (node_1-node_4), (node_4-node_3), (node_4-node_2), plus base horizontal members (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), and (node_1-node_2). This creates a closed polygon with multiple load paths and efficient axial force transfer. Use smaller areas (0:1, 1:0.195 etc.) for short members and moderate size (3:1.759 or 4:3.128) for longest member(s). This keeps mass below 30 and stress below ±20. Confirm with static equilibrium and mass calcs.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Nodes: \nnode_1: (0.0,0.0),\nnode_2: (6.0,0.0),\nnode_3: (2.0,0.0),\nnode_4: (2.0,3.0). \n\nMembers and lengths (approx):\nnode_1-node_2: 6.0\nnode_1-node_3: 2.0\nnode_3-node_2: 4.0\nnode_1-node_4: sqrt((2-0)^2 + (3-0)^2)=3.606\nnode_3-node_4: 3.0\nnode_4-node_2: sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-3)^2)=5.0\n\nMass = sum(length_i * area_i); stress ~ force/area.
