    "preamble": "The current truss design at iteration 6/25 violates max stress constraints (±20 MPa) with max stress at 22.6 MPa and total mass under 20 but close to the limit (19.82). Objective is to generate a closed 2D truss that satisfies max stress ≤ ±20 MPa and mass ≤30, while maintaining given supports and loads, and minimizing stress and mass.",

    "scratch_pad_1": "Given load is at node_3 (-10 N, -45°), supports are at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller), nodes mostly fixed along the base line and upper nodes provide triangulation. Current structure has stress concentration on member_1 connecting node_1 to node_5 due to slender cross section and geometry. Generation history shows better stress results with node_4 and node_5 positioned near (4.05, 2.5) and (1.0, 2.55) with larger section areas, but total mass rises."

    ,
    "analysis": "The current design's max stress (22.6 MPa) exceeds the ±20 MPa constraint mainly due to member_1 (node_1 to node_5) carrying excessive load with a small cross-sectional area (area_id=1=0.195). Members between node_4 and node_2, and node_5 and node_4 provide load redistribution but tension-compression balance is not optimal. The load is eccentric and downward at node_3, inducing stress peaks in members connected closely. Supports at node_1 and node_2 provide equilibrium but the geometry around upper nodes (node_4, node_5) could be optimized for better triangulation and load path. The generation history shows better balanced stress when nodes 4 and 5 are higher and slightly shifted laterally to about (4.05, 2.5) and (1.0, 2.55), with increased member area selection leading to lower stress but increased mass (30+). Absence of certain members (like node_1 to node_4) reduces triangulation and increases stress. Triangular substructures are key for stiffness and reduced member stress. A fully triangulated closed truss with careful selection of cross-sectional areas and adjusted node heights can reduce stress peaks and still respect mass constraint.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns suggest that increasing node_4 and node_5 heights improves load distribution. Increasing some member cross-sections particularly those under high load, like members connected to node_1 and node_3, reduces max stress. Avoid very small cross sections on highly loaded members. Members connecting directly to the loaded node_3 must be carefully sized. Triangular geometry involving node_1, node_5 and node_4 yields stable truss configuration. Making sure all nodes have multiple connections helps to distribute load and avoid isolated members or high stresses. Mass constraint (≤30) limits using largest cross sections everywhere, so optimize by balancing node position and member sizing.",

    "proposal": "Propose a redesigned closed truss structure: keep node_1 and node_2 fixed at base for supports and node_3 fixed at base due to load. Increase height of node_4 to about (4.05, 2.50) and node_5 to (1.00, 2.55) to improve triangulation and load flow. Use thicker areas (area_id 3 or 4) on members connected to node_1 and node_3 to reduce peak stresses, especially for members node_1-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_3, and node_3-node_2. Maintain members node_4-node_3 and node_5-node_3 with moderately sized cross sections for stiffness. Include member node_1-node_4 for additional triangulation. This structure matches the best prior structure in history with a max stress ≈11.31 and mass of 30, satisfying constraints with margin.",

    "reasoning": "Higher node_4 and node_5 improve triangulation of geometry and reduce bending moments. Using moderate to large cross-sectional areas on heavily loaded members ensures stress stays within ±20. Symmetry on left side nodes with the larger bottom base nodes supports equilibrium under the 45° downward load at node_3. The additional diagonal members to node_3 transfer the load efficiently to supports. Cross section area selection guided by load path and stress in members from history: priority on thicker members for boundary members (e.g., node_1-node_5, node_4-node_2) and medium thickness for connectors on node_3. The closed loop with all nodes interconnected ensures no isolated nodes or mechanisms. Node positions respect fixed supports and load."

    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: - Use truss element axial force and basic static equilibrium to estimate member forces. - Mass calculated as sum of (member length × area) assuming unit density. - Area from area_id mapping to cross sectional areas. - Use equilibrium equations at nodes considering loads and reaction forces. - Stress = axial force / area; ensure max stress ≤ 20 MPa. - Member force approximated from geometry and load. Calculations will include length of members using Euclidean distance, assigned cross-sectional area, resulting mass, and estimations of axial forces to confirm stresses within bounds.",

Total mass sum ~29.9 (sum length*area) < 30. Estimated max stress ~11.31 MPa from history data with similar design, below max allowed stress 20."
