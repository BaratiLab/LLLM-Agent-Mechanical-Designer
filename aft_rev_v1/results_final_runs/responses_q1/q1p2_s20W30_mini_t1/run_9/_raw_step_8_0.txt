Objective is to reduce max stress closer to zero and possibly lower mass while keeping structure closed and stable.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given current node and member layout and supports with a force applied at node_3, max stress and mass just meet constraints. Existing members predominantly sized area 3 or less, some members stressed near limit -11 compressive on member_7. Load path involves direct diagonal ties from loaded node to supports and vertical/load carrying members.",\n    "analysis": "Current design ensures all nodes connected. Loads induce high compressive stress (-11.31) in diagonal member_7 (node_1 to node_3). Members near load transfer paths sized at area 2-3. Lower area members exist in members connecting to node_2 and node_5. Mass is exactly at constraint (30). Load at node_3 downward and left (-10 @ -45deg) is transferred via diagonal braces to fixed supports. Symmetry limited as node_5 is left side with elevated height. History shows attempts to increase node_5 and node_4 heights reduce max stress but raise mass above 30. Attempts to reduce mass caused higher stresses over 20 violating constraints. Current design best balanced stress and mass. Member_7 is critical path with highest compressive stress; increasing its area or shortening length by slight node repositioning might help.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Stress concentration occurs primarily in member_7 (node_1 to node_3). Node_5 higher vertical position gives good triangulation but chosen member areas might be suboptimal for stress distribution. Nodes 4 and 5 could be marginally adjusted vertically to reduce stress on member_7, but node_3 must remain at (2,0) due to load. Member_8 (node_5 to node_2) and member_9 (node_1 to node_4) are smallest areas; they might be weak but have low stress currently. Need to keep the closed loop with triangulation for stability.",\n    "proposal": "Fine-tune node_4 position slightly downward reducing length of member_7, increase area of member_7 from \'2\' to \'3\' (1.759 to 1.759;) or \'4\' (3.128) to reduce stress. Adjust member_9 and member_8 areas if mass budget allows. Maintain all members to keep closure and triangulation. Node_5 position fixed in x and y due to structural balance. Node_3, node_1, node_2 fixed by supports and load. This minor adjustment aims to reduce max compressive stress below 11 and possibly reduce mass fraction on member_1 and member_5 areas if stress low there.",\n    "reasoning": "Load path directs force from node_3 diagonally to supports node_1 and node_2. Member_7 carries max compressive load, so increasing its cross-section reduces stress. Lowering node_4 height slightly (from 2.5 to ~2.4) shortens member_7 length, reduces bending moment. Slight area reduction possible in low-stress members to maintain total mass <=30. Triangulation and closed structure preserved. Supports and load node positions maintained per constraints.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assuming unit density and using member length × area for mass. Recalculate length after node_4 move: length_node1_node4 and node1_node3 member lengths. Member stresses proportional to member cross-sectional area and length. Areas chosen from dict area_id keys: 0 to 10. Calculate new lengths, assign area 4 (3.128) to member_7, area 2 (0.782) to some low stress load members to reduce mass, keep rest area 3 (1.759) or 4.
