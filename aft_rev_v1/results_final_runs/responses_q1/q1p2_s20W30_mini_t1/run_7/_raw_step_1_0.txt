Objective is to minimize stress while staying within max stress ±20 and total mass ≤ 30 by optimizing cross-sections and slightly adjusting free node positions.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Four nodes with members forming a closed quadrilateral. Load at node_3 is -10 N at -45°, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Current max stress is 12.15, total mass 18.18, well below limits. Members 2,3,4 tensile or moderate compression, member 1 high compression. Cross-sectional areas could be adjusted and node_4 could be repositioned slightly to reduce stress concentration and improve load path.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure: nodes 1 and 2 fixed supports define base, node_3 loaded horizontally and vertically (-45°). Members 1 and 4 carry significant compression, member 1 stress -12.15 is max in magnitude. Members arranged in two triangles sharing node_4 at (3,2). Longer members (2 and 3) have moderate tension. Closed shape ensures stability. The main load path runs from node_3 to supports via diagonals and vertical/horizontal members. Node_4 position affects stress distribution. Smaller cross-section for member_1 can reduce mass but raise stress; increasing adjacent areas or adjusting node_4\'s height can improve balance. History shows no better structures discovered yet. Constraints fully satisfied and mass well below max 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "To lower max stress, reduce compression in member_1 by increasing area or reducing length or redistributing load by raising node_4 slightly to increase member 4\'s angle, which may reduce stress on member_1. Adjust cross-sections using available discrete areas ensuring no member is undersized for stress. Avoid moving nodes with load or supports. Try area selection targeting member_1 with higher area and members with lower stress can be decreased in area to save mass. Node_3 fixed by load, node_4 free and critical for stress path optimization.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Modify current design by increasing area of member_1 to area_id \'4\' (3.128) from \'2\' (0.782) to reduce compression stress, slightly raise node_4\'s y-coordinate from 2.00 to about 2.30 to improve load path and reduce compression in member_1, decrease area of member_3 to \'1\'(0.195) from \'3\'(1.759) and member_2 to \'2\'(0.782) from \'3\'(1.759) to save mass as their stresses are below limits, keep member_4 area moderate at \'3\'(1.759). This balances stresses, keeps total mass under 30, and maintains a closed stable truss.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Increasing member_1 area decreases its stress (σ = F/A). Raising node_4 increases the inclination of members 1 and 4, distributing axial forces more evenly. Reducing cross-sections where stresses are low saves mass to compensate increased member_1 area. Member_3 and member_2 have tensile stresses lower than allowable, so reducing their areas is safe. Node_3 fixed by load so no change. Supports fixed. Geometry adjustments keep structure statically determinate and closed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Same load and boundary conditions, linear elastic response. Member length recalculated with new node_4 y=2.30. Updated lengths and areas give new masses = Length * Area.
