Objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss with reduced mass ≤30 and max stress within ±20, while preserving load and supports and ensuring full connectivity.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints require max stress ≤±20 and total mass ≤30. Current total mass 45.8 is excessive due to many heavy members and possibly suboptimal load paths. History shows simpler triangular trusses with fewer nodes have lower mass but may have stress issues. The structure must be closed (no open chains), fully connected and constrained by supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller), load at node_3 downward-left.",\n    "analysis": "Current load at node_3 (-10, -45°) induces compression/tension in members connecting nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Member_4 has max compressive stress -4.73 but member areas are large, causing high mass. History shows improved mass with fewer nodes (4 nodes in top-ranked structure). Top ranked has mass 18.18 but max stress 12.15 still high but within limits. Adding node_5 increases complexity and mass without improving stress. The problem is an unstable or poorly triangulated upper chord; members must triangulate between supports and load to transfer forces efficiently. The load path is from loaded node_3 to supports through triangulated members. Roller at node_2 allows horizontal displacement but prevents vertical. The pinned node_1 is fixed. Member cross section must be chosen to handle max stress ≤20 safely with minimal mass.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Avoid adding extra nodes that do not improve load paths. Triangular topology with 4 nodes is efficient. Load at node_3 near mid-span should be supported by diagonal bracing to nodes 1 and 2. Member areas can be smaller if forces are well distributed. Symmetry is less important due to load offset but triangulation is critical. The highest historical mass member was the longer chord members with large area. Reusing and modifying rank_1 structure with 4 nodes but increasing cross-sectional areas on high-stress members and adding stable triangulation may help. Keep nodes with loads and supports fixed in position. Possibly move node_4 slightly vertically to improve force distribution but avoid mass growth.",\n    "proposal": "Propose redesign based on rank_1 historic structure with 4 nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(3,2). Keep load at node_3, supports at node_1 and node_2. Members connect nodes 1-3, 1-4, 2-4, 3-4. Add member from node_3 to node_2 to close the structure and enhance triangulation. Assign area_ids to ensure max stress ≤20 and total mass ≤30. Keep nodes fixed except possibly lifting node_4 slightly to 2.2 for better force path.",\n    "reasoning": "Closed truss with 4 nodes and members forming triangles provides stable geometry and distributes load forces efficiently. Adding member_5: node_3 to node_2 closes the upper triangle preventing buckling modes. Node_4 slight repositioning vertically improves angle and reduces bending moments. Cross section areas are selected to maintain stress limits using known maximum forces, approximated by member length and load magnitude. Member areas chosen from area_ids to keep mass low but sufficient for strength. Mass calculated by summing member lengths × area and assuming unit density. Max stress estimated by force/member area using load and equilibrium assumptions.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Member forces linearly distributed, member area proportional to stress capacity, length calculated by Euclidean distance. Total mass = sum of (length * area). Max stress = max(F/A). Calculate lengths: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(3,2.2). Members: 1-3, 1-4, 2-4, 3-4, 3-2.
