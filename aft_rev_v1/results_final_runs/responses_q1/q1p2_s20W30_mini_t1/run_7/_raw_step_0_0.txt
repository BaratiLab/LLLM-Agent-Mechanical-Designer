The design must connect all nodes and possibly add nodes ensuring strong triangulation for load transfer minimizing stress.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "There are 3 original nodes along x-axis, with node_3 loaded negatively at -10N at -45°. Supports at node_1 and 2 fix structure horizontally and vertically. A closed structure requires at least a triangle. Current layout is collinear - no closed polygon, so at least one node above x-axis needed.",\n\n    "analysis": "To reduce stress, a stable triangular configuration is necessary. Original nodes are on x-axis (0,0), (2,0), (6,0). Load at node_3 acts diagonally down-left. Supports prevent horizontal and vertical displacement at ends. Without a top node, no closed truss forms. Failure mode is axial tension/compression beyond ±20. Direct members from loaded node to supports form base but don\'t form a closed polygon. Adding a new top node near midpoint above x-axis will provide triangulation, distributing loads efficiently and minimizing stress. Member lengths and cross-section areas affect mass. Optimization must balance length × area ≤ 30 mass and stress ≤ ±20.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns indicate that creating a triangle from nodes (0,0), (6,0), and a new node above x-axis near (3,2.0) gives effective force distribution. Load downward at 45° causes tension and compression in diagonals — area selection impacts stress. Choosing the right cross section area to keep stress low yet mass under 30 is crucial. Avoiding large cross sections to minimize mass but still support loads.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (3.00, 2.00) for triangulation (equilateral triangle approximation). Members between node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, and node_3-node_4 form stable closed truss. Member node_1-node_3 already exists for load path. Assign cross-section areas from given area_ids based on member length and expected force to keep stress ≤±20. Larger areas for longer/more stressed members. The base members (node_1-node_3) smaller, diagonals larger.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic behavior, axial forces only. Use force equilibrium in x and y at node_3. Calculate member lengths using distance formula. Stress = force / area. Area chosen from given discrete values to reduce mass. Mass = Σ length_i × area_i. Use trigonometry for force direction. Member forces estimated by method of joints. Try area_id 4 (3.128) for top diagonals, area_id 2 (0.782) for base, area_id 1 (0.195) for less stressed.",\n\n    "calculation": "Node positions: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(3,2). Member lengths: L13=2.0, L14=~3.606, L24=~3.605, L34=~2.236. Load at node_3: 10N at -45° → Fx=-7.07N, Fy=-7.07N. Solving equilibrium at node_3 considering members 13 and 34. Forces in members 13 and 34 satisfy Fx and Fy. Assume symmetrical loads in diagonals, cross section area id=4 (3.128) for diagonals to keep stress low. Base member 13 with area_id=2 (0.782). Mass = sum(length*area): 2.0*0.782 + 3.606*3.128 + 3.605*3.128 + 2.236*3.128 ≈ 1.564 + 11.28 + 11.28 + 6.99 = 31.114 (slightly above 30). Adjust diagonal area_id to 3 (1.759). New mass: 2*0.782 + 3.6*1.759*3 = 1.564 + 3*6.334 = 1.564 + 19.00 = 20.56 < 30. Calculate stresses: member force / area_id; forces below ±20.
