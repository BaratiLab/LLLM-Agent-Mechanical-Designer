Objective is to minimize stresses further while satisfying max ±20 stress and mass ≤30 constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Current truss: nodes fixed at node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0); free node_3 and node_4 positioned symmetrically. Members form a triangular prism topology with cross sectional areas varying (area_id 1 to 4). Load causes compressive stress up to -8.1, total mass 29.159 within constraints.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 directed downward-left (-10 N at -45°) transfers through members connecting node_3 to supports and node_4. Member_1 (-8.1 compressive) near max stress; stresses elsewhere moderate. History shows when node_4 is higher or moved right (rank_2), stress increases, possibly due to longer lever arms and less optimal triangulation. Mass near limit, largest mass contributor member_3 (13.8 units). Current topology stable: node_4 connects all corners forming a closed quadrilateral with triangular internal member_4. Supports correctly constrain DOFs. Load path from node_3 to pinned node_1 and roller node_2 well balanced. No isolated nodes. Improvement possible by reducing member_3 area moderately and adjusting node_4 slightly to lower stress in critical members while keeping mass ≤30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 carries highest compressive force; member_3 is heavy but has moderate stress. Reducing area in low stressed members (member_2, member_5) could cut mass. Slight repositioning of node_4 vertically and horizontally may improve load path and reduce member_1 stress. Avoid node positions that increase max stress beyond current 8.1 or increase mass. Member lengths and angles crucial for load distribution balance.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Optimize by slightly shifting node_4 position downward (~2.0 m y-coordinate) and slightly left (~3.6 m x-coordinate) to reduce lever arm length and compressive stress on member_1. Reduce member_3 area from \'4\' (3.128) to \'3\' (1.759) to cut mass, increase member_2 area from \'2\' to \'3\' to compensate stress, and keep other memberships same with slight area tweaks to remain in constraints.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Lowering node_4 reduces bending moment on node_3 members. Decreasing member_3 area reduces heavy mass contribution while keeping stress manageable. Increasing member_2 area compensates for load sharing from reduced member_3 area. Overall, triangulated structure retained with closed loop of nodes (1-3-4-2-1). Supports remain unchanged. Use principles of load path simplification and optimized material distribution to minimize stress and mass within constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic truss, stress inversely proportional to area, total mass sum(length_i * area_i) with given area values, total stress max 20 in abs. Calculate new member lengths from node coords using Euclidean distance. Member forces estimated based on load and geometry. Update member_3 area from 3.128 to 1.759 reduces mass by roughly 6 units. Move node_4 from (3.8,2.25) to approx (3.6,2.0). Member lengths recalculated; member stresses scaled by their areas accordingly. Check max stress and total mass to ensure <= constraints.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node_4 repositioned to (3.6, 2.0). Member lengths recalculated: member_3 length approx sqrt((3.6-0)^2+(2.0-0)^2)=4.12 m vs previous 4.3 m (slightly shorter); mass of member_3 = 4.12*1.759=7.24 (vs ~13.8 prior) reducing mass by ~6.6 units. Member_1 length (0,0)-(2,0)=2m unchanged, member_2 length (2,0)-(6,0)=4m unchanged, member_4 length (2,0)-(3.6,2.0)=2.56m approx, member_5 length (6,0)-(3.6,2.0)=3.7m approx, member_6 length (0,0)-(6,0)=6m.
