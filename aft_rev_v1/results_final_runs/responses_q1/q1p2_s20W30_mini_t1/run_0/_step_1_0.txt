    "preamble": "The current truss design with 4 nodes and 5 members violates max stress constraint (36.26 > 20) though total mass is within limit (27.64 < 30). The task is to redesign a closed 2D truss structure maintaining given supports and loads, while fully satisfying max stress ±20 and mass ≤30 constraints.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given load is a 10 units force at node_3 directed -45° (diagonal down-left). Supports are pinned at node_1(0,0) and roller at node_2(6,0). Nodes currently along x-axis with one node (4) elevated at y=3. Member 4 is overstressed at -36.26. Mass concentrated mostly in members connecting node_2. The structure is not optimally triangulated for load transfer from node_3 to supports.",
    "analysis": "Current truss lacks sufficient triangulation; the direct member_4 between node_3 and node_4 is highly stressed. Node_3 located at (2,0) under load, connected both to support nodes and node_4 above. Load transfer is inefficient; members near node_2 have large cross sections, adding mass but not sufficiently reducing stress. The open polygon does not optimally distribute tensile and compressive forces. Adding diagonal members to create two triangulated panels and repositioning node_4 closer horizontally to load node can distribute loads better. The load path: force at node_3 resolves into compression/tension in members connected to supports. Current history structure fails stress constraint mainly due to member_4.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "A closed triangulated structure with nodes positioned to form two triangles sharing the loaded node would improve force distribution and reduce stress concentration. Choosing suitable cross sectional areas that keep mass under 30 while controlling stress is essential. Supports fixed at node_1 and node_2, loaded node_3 cannot move, but node_4 can be repositioned. Minimizing the length of the most stressed members reduces maximum stresses. The member connecting node_3 and node_4 should shorten and member arrangement optimized for force balance.",
    "proposal": "Redesign with 4 nodes: node_1 (0.00,0.00, pinned), node_2 (6.00,0.00, roller), node_3 (2.00,0.00, load applied), node_4 repositioned to (4.20,2.40). Add new members creating two triangles - node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, and a diagonal member node_1-node_2 for closed triangulation and improved load paths. Adjust cross sectional areas from given presets to control stresses within ±20 and mass <30.",
    "reasoning": "Using a triangular truss distributing the diagonal load through node_4 positioned near the line between node_3 and node_2 allows the force at node_3 to split into components directed towards supports. Adding node_4 at (4.20, 2.40) forms two triangles: [node_1, node_3, node_4] and [node_2, node_3, node_4]. This geometry stabilizes the structure and shortens the highly stressed members. Cross sections: moderate area for longer members to reduce stress and maintain mass. The direct member between supports (node_1 to node_2) adds stiffness and helps load transfer. All nodes are connected, ensuring a closed structure.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Notation: Length L_ij = distance(node_i, node_j); stress σ = F/A; F computed via static equilibrium at nodes. Approximate force distribution by splitting load at node_3 along members to node_1, node_2, and node_4 according to geometry and load angle. Mass = Σ L_ij * area_density from area_id dictionary. Cross sectional areas chosen from {1:0.195,2:0.782,3:1.759,4:3.128}, higher areas for longer members or heavily loaded.
