Supports: pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Need closed truss (triangle or polygon). Current layout is a line; no closed shape exists. Minimum closed shape is a triangle. To resist lateral load, introduce a node above line to form apex, creating triangulation.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 acts down-left, causing bending moment and shear on the base. Supports provide vertical and horizontal restraints. Triangular truss best to minimize bending stresses, converting loads into axial forces. By adding apex node above node_3, we create two diagonal members that triangulate the system with base members. This reduces bending and stress concentrations. Using areas from given ID set balancing mass and strength. Triangulation ensures stability and closed structure. Stress limit ±20 and mass ≤30 restrain member sizing and lengths. Long base member (6m) suggests need to distribute forces in diagonals.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Triangular simple closed truss has 4 members connecting base nodes and apex. Placing apex approximately vertically above node_3 reduces horizontal forces in base, improves load path. Base member splits: node_1 to node_2, node_1 to node_3, node_3 to node_2 for better force distribution (forming 4 members instead of 3). Check mass impact: member lengths ~2 to 6m; choose moderate area sizes to stay within mass limit. Avoid large area except in longest base member. Symmetry of apex placement helps load equilibrium.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Introduce node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) above node_3 to form apex. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_2-node_4 form a closed polygon with triangulation. Larger apex height increases vertical member length but reduces horizontal bending. Use balance of cross-sectional areas: smallest area for short diagonals (0.195), mid areas for base members (1 or 0.782), largest allowed for longest member (node_2-node_4, ~3.6m) if needed to reduce stress. Calculate forces by static equilibrium, ensuring compressive/tensile stress below 20.
