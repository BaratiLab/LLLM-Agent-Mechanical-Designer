The objective is to generate a closed 2D truss with improved load paths, reduced max stress within ±20 and mass below 30, maintaining node loads and supports fixed.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Initial structure has 4 nodes: 2 supports pinned at node_1 (0,0), roller at node_2 (6,0), load -10N at 45° downward at node_3 (2,0), and node_4 at (3,2.5). Members form basic frame with diagonal member_5 showing max compressive stress (-39.05). Constraints violated: max stress. Mass acceptable.",\n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 causes compressive force on member_5, likely due to insufficient triangulation and large tensile/compressive differential stresses. Members connecting to node_4 have moderate stress. Structure is minimally triangulated but stresses concentrated in one diagonal member. Closed structure but uneven force distribution. Node_3 is close to base line, limiting geometry for efficient load transfer. Supports are well placed. Current design lacks adequate triangulation in loaded region causing member_5 overload. Mass is low due to small cross sections but that increases stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Need to increase triangulation and redistribute forces away from heavily stressed member_5. Consider repositioning node_4 higher to create more stable triangle and avoid high compression. Possibly add one more node for improved truss geometry. Member areas can be increased moderately but must stay under mass limit. Keep supports and loaded node positions fixed as per constraints.",\n  "proposal": "Redesign structure with 5 nodes: Keep node_1(0,0) pinned, node_2(6,0) roller, node_3(2,0) load. Add node_4 at (1.5,3.0) and node_5 at (4.5,3.0) to form two upper corners. Connect nodes to form two triangles sharing node_3 at base and connected to supports. Use proper triangulation: members along base, from supports and between top nodes. Assign areas to balance mass and stress.",\n  "reasoning": "Symmetrical trapezoidal truss shape over base with load at node_3, spreading load path from loaded node to supports through multiple triangulated members reduces max stress. Nodes 4 and 5 at upper elevation increase structural depth, lowering member forces. Triangulation ensures stability and redirects forces efficiently. Max stress constrained by increasing cross-section on members adjacent to load and reducing area on less loaded members to keep mass under 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Uniform material with linear elastic behavior. Member length from Euclidean distance. Member force estimated using static equilibrium vertical and horizontal force balances. Stress = Force / Area. Mass = sum(length*area).
