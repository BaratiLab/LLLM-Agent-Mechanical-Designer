Objective is to reduce max stress further under ±20 limit and keep mass <30 by smart area assignment and members retention.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Initial structure is a 4-node trapezoidal truss loaded downward-left on node_3, supported pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Members form two overlapping triangles: (1-3-4) and (3-4-2). Member 4 (1-4) has largest mass with area_id=3. Current max compressive stress on member_1 (-15.5), others have lower stresses.",\n\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-10 N at -45°) causes high compression in member_1 (1-3) and tension in member_4 (1-4). Members (3-4) and (4-2) carry moderate loads. Member_5 and member_6 with smaller areas carry small stress. Current mass distribution shows member_4 carries significant mass to reduce tension stress, which is reasonable for stability. Generation history shows adding more nodes increased stress or mass beyond limits, or violated constraints. Reducing max stress below 15.5 requires area adjustments or slight repositioning of unconstrained nodes without violating fixed nodes or support constraints.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "High stress is mainly concentrated in member_1 and member_4. Member 1 has high compression; increasing its area reduces stress but increases mass. Member 4 handles tension; can optimize by slightly adjusting node_4 position upward to reduce bending and stress in (1-4) and (3-4). Area of member_5 (3-2) is smallest but stress low, its size can remain minimal. Member_6 (1-2) could possibly reduce area to save mass. Overall structure is minimal and closed, triangular groups resist load well. Best to keep nodes 1, 2 fixed; adjust node_4 slightly upwards and optimize areas from given list to reduce max stress and total mass.",\n\n    "proposal": "Refine node_4 position to (4.00, 3.25) to improve force distribution and reduce stress in members 1 and 4. Retain current six-member topology ensuring the truss remains closed and stable. Adjust cross-sectional areas: increase area of member_1 slightly to reduce max compressive stress; reduce area of member_6 to reduce mass if stresses are low; maintain or slightly increase area of member_4 to control tension stress. This balances masses and stresses within constraints while keeping mass under 30.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Triangular configuration ensures stability and load paths. Moving node_4 higher increases vertical component in (1-4) and (3-4), reducing tensile stress peaks. Increasing member_1 area handles high compression directly. Decreasing member_6 area reduces unnecessary mass as its stress is moderate and negative. Area selections from given discrete options chosen to balance mass and stress within ±20 stress limits and total mass <30. Supports fixed nodes prevent repositioning of nodes 1 and 2, node_3 loaded fixed too. Node_4 free to reposition to optimize load path.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic behavior, stress ∝ force/area, member force varies approx. with geometry and load angle. Geometry: node_4 moved from (4.0,3.0) to (4.0,3.25). Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance. Member forces estimated by equilibrium and altered geometry. Area choices: member_1 from 2 (0.782) to 3 (1.759) reduces stress. Member_6 reduced from 1 (0.195) to 0 (1) or 1 for minimal area to keep stress low.
