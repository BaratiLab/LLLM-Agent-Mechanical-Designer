The current design is over-stressed (max(abs(stress)) = 60.44). The structure must remain closed and all nodes must be connected, with supports and loads at fixed nodes. The goal is to produce a feasible, efficient truss meeting all constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: Minimize max(abs(stress)) and total mass for a loaded/supported truss, keeping stress ≤ 30 and mass ≤ 30. Current and historic designs are either too stressed or heavy. Need to balance triangulation and member sizing for strength and efficiency.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current structure is a six-node, multi-bay truss with heavy, long diagonals and light, short horizontals. The highest stress (-60.44) occurs in a bottom chord member, indicating that the lower chord is too slender or under-supported. Historic designs with fewer nodes have lower stress but higher mass or still violate the stress constraint. Members with high area IDs contribute to mass but do not sufficiently reduce peak stress. The load at node_3 (-10 kN at -45°) requires robust, direct load paths to both supports (node_1: pinned, node_2: roller). The structure must be closed, with all nodes interconnected. The best approach is to introduce additional triangulation and optimize member areas, especially in the lower chord, to reduce stress concentrations.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Over-stress is recurring in the bottom chord near the loaded node. Adding a vertical at node_3 and better triangulation in the upper region should help. Avoiding large unsupported spans and distributing the load more efficiently will reduce peak stresses. Use minimum required area for lightly loaded members, but increase area in critical load paths. The structure should remain symmetric where possible for even force distribution.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss by adding a vertical member at node_3 (the loaded node), repositioning node_6 to form a more optimal triangle above the loaded region, and ensuring all nodes are connected by triangulated members. Increase the area of critical bottom chord members, and use minimal area for less stressed members. This reduces the moment arm and distributes load more efficiently. The structure will use six nodes, with a closed, fully triangulated configuration.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A Pratt-like truss with a vertical at the loaded node and diagonals from the top to supports will efficiently transfer load. Triangulation reduces unsupported lengths, lowering stress in bottom chord members. The vertical at the loaded node provides a direct path for the vertical load component, while diagonals handle the horizontal component. The upper node (node_6) is placed above node_3 for optimal force flow. Use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for critical members and \'1\' (0.195) for others to balance mass and strength.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Steel truss, load at node_3 (-10 kN at -45°: Fx = -7.07 kN, Fy = -7.07 kN). Node_1 (0,0) pinned, node_2 (6,0) roller. Place node_4 at (4,0), node_5 at (2,2), node_6 at (4,2.5). Members: bottom chord (node_1 - node_3 - node_4 - node_2), vertical at node_3, diagonals to node_5 and node_6, top chord (node_5 - node_6). Calculate member forces using static equilibrium. Assign area_id \'2\' to the most loaded members (bottom chord near node_3), \'1\' elsewhere. Estimate mass: sum(length × area). Check that max stress < 30, mass < 30.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Bottom chord (node_1-node_3-node_4-node_2): Main load path. Diagonals (node_1-node_5, node_3-node_5, node_4-node_6, node_2-node_6) transfer load to supports. Top chord (node_5-node_6) stabilizes. Vertical at node_3 (node_3-node_5) carries vertical load. Approximate member forces: Most loaded member is bottom chord between node_1-node_3 (expecting ~10-20 kN), assign area_id \'2\' (0.782). Diagonals and verticals expected to carry less, assign area_id \'1\' (0.195). Mass: All members\' length × area. Estimate: Bottom chord ~2m × 0.782 + 2m × 0.195 + ... ≈ 8-10 units total.
