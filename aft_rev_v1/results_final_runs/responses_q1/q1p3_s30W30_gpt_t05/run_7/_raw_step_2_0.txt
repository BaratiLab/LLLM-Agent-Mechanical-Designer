The current design exceeds the maximum allowable stress constraint (|stress| > 30), though the total mass is well below the limit (mass < 30). The objective is to redesign the truss to ensure all member stresses are ≤ ±30, while keeping the structure closed and mass minimized.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Initial review: The main constraint violation is excessive compressive stress in member_6 (-36.26). The design is a single-bay, triangular truss with an elevated node_4. Both current and historic structures fail the stress constraint, with member_6 or member_3 consistently overstressed. The pattern suggests a need to improve force distribution, possibly by altering geometry or section areas.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The load at node_3 is significant (-10 kN at -45°), creating both horizontal and vertical components. Node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) provide stability. The current design uses a simple triangular arrangement with node_4 above the base. Members connecting node_3 to node_4 experience high compressive force due to the load direction and geometry. Attempts to increase section area alone (history) led to excessive mass without resolving stress. The structure lacks redundancy and efficient force triangulation, causing localized overstress.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key insight: The force at node_3 is not optimally distributed—node_4 is too close to node_3, resulting in steep force angles and high compressive loads in member_6. To resolve this, node_4 should be repositioned further from node_3 to flatten the triangle, reducing the compressive component in member_6 and better distributing forces. Adding a fifth node (node_5) to form a double triangle (truss with a central vertical) could further reduce member forces by providing another load path.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss by moving node_4 higher and to the right (e.g., (3.5, 3.8)), and adding node_5 above node_3 (e.g., (2.0, 2.0)). Connect node_5 to all base nodes and node_4, forming a Warren truss with vertical. This increases triangulation and distributes the load more efficiently. Assign larger section areas only to highly stressed members, keeping others minimal to save mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By elevating node_4 and introducing node_5, the truss becomes a double triangle (Warren truss with vertical), an efficient geometry for spreading both vertical and horizontal load components. This reduces peak compressive/tensile forces in any single member. Member areas are chosen based on anticipated force magnitude: members likely to see high forces (e.g., those directly in the load path) get larger areas, while others use the minimum. This approach balances stress reduction with mass minimization.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All nodes except loaded and supported nodes can be moved. The load at node_3 (-10 kN @ -45°) creates Fx = -7.07 kN, Fy = -7.07 kN. Reposition node_4 to (3.5, 3.8) and add node_5 at (2.0, 2.0).
