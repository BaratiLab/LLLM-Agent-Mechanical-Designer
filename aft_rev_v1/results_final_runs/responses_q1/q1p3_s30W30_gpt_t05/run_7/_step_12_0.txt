    "preamble": "The task is to generate an optimal 2D closed truss structure supporting a single load at node_3, with pinned and roller supports at node_1 and node_2. The previous design violated the max stress constraint (|stress|=37.48 > 30), though mass was acceptable (24.17 < 30). The objective is to minimize stress and total mass while ensuring all nodes are connected and all constraints are satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: All member stresses within ±30, total mass ≤ 30, fully connected truss. Current and historic structures either overstress critical members or are inefficiently heavy. Need to improve force paths and triangulation for better load distribution.",
    
    "analysis": "Current and past designs show that the main constraint violation is excessive member stress, especially in members directly transmitting the load from node_3 to supports. Designs with minimal triangulation or direct, long members (e.g., node_1-node_3) see high stress. The best mass-efficient designs (e.g., constraint_not_met_4, _5, _6) are still overstressed. Designs with more triangulation (e.g., two vertical layers with nodes above the base) tend to distribute load better but often use unnecessarily large or long members, increasing mass. The load at node_3 is angled (-10kN @ -45°), requiring both horizontal and vertical reactions. Key failure modes are overstressed diagonal or direct base members. To satisfy constraints, a more efficient load path is needed, likely via a two-layer truss (Warren or Pratt) with optimized member areas.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: High stress in direct node_1-node_3 or node_3-node_2 members. Triangulation helps, but only if member areas are sufficient and nodes are positioned to minimize force magnitudes. The best chance is to use a double-layer truss with an upper chord, placing intermediate nodes above node_3 to reduce force in the longest span. Avoid excessively heavy designs by limiting member lengths and using minimum required areas.",
    
    "proposal": "Redesign the structure using a six-node, two-layer truss (Pratt/Warren hybrid): keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed; add node_4 above node_1, node_5 above node_2, and node_6 above node_3. Connect all nodes with triangulation to ensure a closed structure, optimizing node_6's height for best stress distribution. Assign member areas based on expected force paths, using larger sections only where needed.",
    
    "reasoning": "A two-layer truss spreads the load from node_3 more efficiently to both supports, reducing the force in any single member. Placing node_6 above node_3 allows vertical and diagonal members to share the load, lowering stress in the base chord. Triangulation ensures redundancy and stability. Member areas are chosen based on estimated force: base chord and diagonals near node_3 get higher areas; upper chords and less stressed diagonals get minimum area.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Load at node_3 is -10kN @ -45°, which splits equally into x and y components (~-7.07kN each). Node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) provide horizontal and vertical reactions. Set node_4 at (1.2, 1.7), node_5 at (4.8, 1.7), node_6 at (3.0, 2.5) to form a symmetric upper chord. Use area_id '2' (0.782) for base and main diagonals, '1' (0.195) for upper chords and less stressed diagonals. Calculate member lengths, estimate forces via method of joints, and check that no member stress exceeds ±30 and total mass < 30.",
    
    "calculation": "Member lengths: base = 6.0m, diagonals ≈ 2.08–2.92m, verticals ≈ 1.7–2.5m. For area_id '2' (0.782), stress = force / area: max force = 30 * 0.782 ≈ 23.46kN, so use '3' (1.759) for any member expected to see >23kN. Estimate: base chord (node_1-node_2) sees largest force, so use '3' for it. Diagonals and verticals near node_3 may see up to 15–20kN, so '2' is sufficient. Upper chords and remote diagonals get '1'. Mass = sum(length × area) for all members; total must be <30.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Final check: All nodes are connected; structure is closed and triangulated. No member expected to see >30kN. Assign areas conservatively based on load path. Node coordinates use precise floats. All constraints should now be satisfied. Ready to output.",
