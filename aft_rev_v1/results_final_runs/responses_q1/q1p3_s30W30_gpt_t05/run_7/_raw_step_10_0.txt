The current and historic structures either violate the stress or mass constraint. The objective is to generate a new, feasible, efficient truss.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The structure must support a single load at node_3 (-10.0, -45°), with pinned and roller supports at nodes 1 and 2. Constraints are strict: max|stress| ≤ 30, total mass ≤ 30. Current/historic designs are either too heavy or overstressed. Efficient triangulation and minimal member cross-sections are needed.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current and historic structures show two main issues: (1) excessive mass when using larger cross-sections to reduce stress, (2) excessive stress when using minimal cross-sections. Many structures are overbuilt (many members, high mass) or underbuilt (high stress in key members). The best historic structures (e.g., constraint_not_met_1 and _2) are light and close to the stress limit, but just over the allowable stress. The load at node_3, applied at -45°, induces both vertical and horizontal reactions. A compact, triangulated truss with short spans and efficient load paths is optimal. Redundant members and excessive area must be avoided.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Structures with 5–6 nodes and 10–13 members are common, but often overbuilt. The best mass/stress trade-off is seen in historic design \'constraint_not_met_1\' (mass ≈ 35, max stress ≈ 5.3), but mass is just over the limit. Using smaller areas increases stress above 30. The load is applied near the left support, so a compact, nearly equilateral triangulation above the base is likely optimal. Members with higher area should be used only where stress is highest, especially in direct load paths.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss as a compact, symmetric, Warren-type truss with 5 nodes: keep node_1, node_2 (supports), node_3 (load), and add two top nodes (node_4, node_5) forming a shallow triangle above the base. Connect all nodes to form a closed, triangulated structure. Use minimal area on low-stress members, increase area only on high-stress members. This reduces both mass and max stress, while ensuring closure and connectivity.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A Warren (triangular) truss efficiently distributes both vertical and horizontal components of the load, with short member lengths and good triangulation. Placing top nodes slightly above the base and centered between supports (but offset to avoid excessive moment arms) will minimize member forces. Connecting node_3 to both top nodes and supports closes the structure and allows force sharing. By estimating force ratios and distributing areas accordingly, the mass can be minimized while keeping all stresses below ±30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume node_1 at (0,0), node_2 at (6,0), node_3 at (2,0) (load).

Assign area_id \'1\' (0.195) to most members, area_id \'2\' (0.782) to those directly carrying the applied load (e.g., (3-4), (3-5)).

Assign area_id \'2\' (0.782) to (3-4), (3-5), (3-1), (3-2); area_id \'1\' (0.195) elsewhere.
