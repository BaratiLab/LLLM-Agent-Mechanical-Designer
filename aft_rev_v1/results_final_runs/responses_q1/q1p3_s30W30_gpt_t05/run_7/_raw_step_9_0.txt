The current and historic designs all violate the max stress constraint (|stress| > 30), though mass is well below the 30-unit limit. The objective is to minimize stress (≤30 in all members) and keep total mass ≤30, using precise node placement and area selection.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The problem involves a 6-node truss with a concentrated load at node_3 (-10 kN at -45°), and two supports. Prior attempts, including the current design, fail mainly due to overstressed members. The structure must be closed (no isolated nodes), and all members must meet the stress and mass constraints. The cross-sectional areas are discrete, so member sizing must be strategic.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current and historic structures are variations of Warren and Pratt-type trusses, with some verticals and diagonals. Most failures are due to overstressed diagonals or chords, especially near the loaded node_3. The mass is always well below the limit, so increasing member sizes is possible. The load at node_3 creates significant shear and moment at that point, demanding robust triangulation and sufficient member area. The best historic structure in terms of stress (constraint_not_met_1, max_stress=5.28) is very heavy (mass=35.05). The current design is light (8.32) but overstressed (34.19). Members near node_3 (especially those connecting to node_5 and node_6) are critical. The structure is closed, but some members are too slender for the high forces.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The key pattern is that stress is consistently too high in certain members, especially diagonals near the loaded node. There is ample mass budget to increase member sizes. The node layout is generally efficient, but could be improved by slightly raising the upper nodes (node_5 and node_6) to improve force distribution. Triangulation is good, but some diagonals may need thicker areas. All nodes are connected, so closure is satisfied.",\n    \n    "proposal": "To achieve all constraints, I will retain the current node layout (to respect support and load locations) but slightly adjust the y-coordinates of node_5 and node_6 upward for better triangulation and force path. I will increase the cross-sectional area of the most highly stressed diagonals (especially those connected to node_3 and node_5/6) to area_id=\'3\' or \'4\'. Chord members will be set to area_id=\'2\' for robustness. This will reduce stress in critical members while keeping total mass well below 30.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By raising node_5 and node_6 (the top nodes), the vertical component of the diagonal forces increases, reducing the force in each diagonal and distributing the load more efficiently. Increasing the area of critical diagonals directly reduces stress (stress = force/area). The bottom chord (nodes 1-2) should be robust, as it carries significant axial force. Using the available mass budget, I will optimize member areas to ensure no member exceeds ±30 in stress.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Load at node_3 is resolved into x and y components (-7.071, -7.071). Members near node_3 (especially node_3-node_5, node_3-node_6, node_5-node_6) will see the highest forces. Use area_id=\'4\' (A=3.128) for these, area_id=\'2\' (A=0.782) for less critical members. Raise node_5 to (2.0, 2.7) and node_6 to (4.0, 3.3) to improve force distribution. Compute member lengths and mass: mass = sum(length × area). Estimate member forces by static equilibrium and truss analysis (method of joints). Select areas so that max(force/area) ≤ 30.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_4 = 2.0, node_4-node_2 = 2.0, node_1-node_5 ≈ 3.36, node_3-node_5 ≈ 2.7, node_4-node_6 ≈ 3.08, node_2-node_6 ≈ 3.44, node_5-node_6 ≈ 2.24, node_3-node_6 ≈ 3.60, node_4-node_5 ≈ 2.83. Assign area_id=\'4\' (A=3.128) to diagonals near node_3 and top chord, area_id=\'2\' (A=0.782) to bottom chord and less stressed members. Total mass = Σ(length × area) ≈ (2.0+2.0+2.0)×0.782 + (3.36+2.7+3.08+3.44+2.24+3.60+2.83)×3.128 ≈ 4.692 + 67.55 ≈ 16.24, well below the 30 limit. Estimated max force in critical diagonals ≈ 70% of applied load = 7.07 kN, so stress = 7.07/3.128 ≈ 2.26 < 30.
