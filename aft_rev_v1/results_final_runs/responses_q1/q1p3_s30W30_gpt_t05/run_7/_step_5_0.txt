    "preamble": "The problem is to design a closed 2D truss structure supporting a load at node_3, with pinned and roller supports at node_1 and node_2, respectively. The current and previous designs violate the stress constraint (|stress| > 30) and sometimes have high mass. The objective is to generate a structurally efficient, closed truss with all member stresses ≤ 30 and total mass ≤ 30, using only the specified node positions for supports and loads.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "The truss must be closed, all nodes connected, and must efficiently transfer a -10kN load at node_3 (at -45°) to the supports. Current and previous designs show overstressed members, especially those directly connecting to node_3. The load path is not optimally triangulated, and member areas may not be efficiently distributed.",
    
    "analysis": "The current and historic designs primarily use a Warren or Pratt truss topology, but members connecting node_1, node_3, and node_2 are overstressed (up to 51.17). Most mass is concentrated in vertical and diagonal members. The load at node_3 is significant and off-axis, requiring strong triangulation for both vertical and horizontal components. Designs with more triangulation (e.g., additional node near the center/top) and better area allocation could reduce peak stresses. The best historic structure (constraint_not_met_1) used more members but had high mass and still exceeded stress limits. The main issue is insufficient triangulation near the loaded node and inefficient member sizing.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "A more efficient solution is needed: triangulate the upper region, add a top node to split the span, and distribute the load more evenly. Using smaller area members where stress is low, and larger areas only where needed, can reduce mass. The structure must remain closed, so all nodes (including node_3) must be included in triangles.",
    
    "proposal": "Redesign the truss by adding a central top node (node_6) above node_3, forming two main triangles between supports and the loaded node. Connect node_6 to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, forming a 'K-truss' or subdivided Pratt truss. This distributes the load more evenly and reduces peak member forces. Use minimum area for low-stress members, and larger areas for members expected to see higher forces (especially those connecting to node_3 and node_6). Node positions for supports and loaded node remain fixed.",
    
    "reasoning": "Triangulation is key: adding node_6 above node_3 creates two shorter load paths to the supports. This reduces the span of the highly stressed lower chord and allows for better force distribution. Members from node_3 to node_6, and from node_6 to supports, take the bulk of the load, so their areas should be larger. Diagonals and upper chords can be smaller. All nodes are connected, forming a closed structure. This approach minimizes both peak stress and total mass.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume: node_6 at (3.0, 3.8) (centered above node_3, slightly higher than previous top nodes for improved triangulation). Members: (1-2), (1-3), (2-3), (1-6), (2-6), (3-6), (4-6), (5-6), (4-5), (3-4), (3-5), (4-1), (5-2). Estimate member lengths and assign area_id based on expected force (higher area for members adjacent to node_3 and node_6, minimum area for others). Calculate mass as sum(length × area). Estimate stresses using equilibrium: load at node_3 splits into two diagonals (to node_1 and node_2) and up to node_6, reducing individual member force. Ensure no member exceeds ±30 in stress.",
    
    "calculation": "Key member lengths: node_3 to node_6 ≈ sqrt((3-2)^2 + (3.8-0)^2) ≈ 3.93; node_6 to node_1 ≈ sqrt(3^2 + 3.8^2) ≈ 4.84; node_6 to node_2 ≈ sqrt(3^2 + 3.8^2) ≈ 4.84; node_1 to node_2 = 6.0. Assign area_id '3' (1.759) to members node_3-node_6, node_6-node_1, node_6-node_2; area_id '1' (0.195) to diagonals and upper chords. Total mass: sum(length × area) ≈ (3.93+4.84+4.84)×1.759 + rest × 0.195 ≈ 24.1 + 5.0 ≈ 29.1 (within constraint). By splitting the load, max stress per member should be ≤ 30. All nodes are connected (closed structure).",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Double-check all nodes are connected, mass is under 30, and no member is likely to exceed stress constraint. Use only required area_ids. Ensure no isolated nodes. Finalize node_6 position for optimal triangulation and mass/stress balance. All instructions followed.",
