Previous designs failed due to excessive member stresses (>30) or insufficient member areas, despite low total mass. The objective is to minimize stress (≤30 in all members) and total mass (≤30), ensuring all nodes are connected and the structure is statically determinate and efficient.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs: Supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller), load at node 3 (-10, -45 deg), area_id options, and a need for a closed truss. Previous designs either had overstressed members (especially those directly linking supports to loaded nodes) or were overbuilt and heavy. The structure must distribute the load efficiently to avoid overstressing slender members.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current and historic structures often concentrate load paths through single members (e.g., node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2), causing high stresses. The load at node_3 is significant and diagonal, requiring robust triangulation to split and distribute forces. The best mass-efficient designs (e.g., constraint_not_met_5, constraint_not_met_11) are too slender and thus overstressed. More robust designs (e.g., constraint_not_met_1, constraint_not_met_2) are heavy but have low stresses. A well-triangulated Warren or Pratt truss, with some verticals and diagonals, can balance these factors. The geometry must ensure short load paths and avoid long, slender, highly stressed members. Members along the load path should have higher area_id (e.g., \'2\' or \'3\').",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key patterns: Direct members between supports and loaded node are always overstressed when using low area_id. Adding a top chord and triangulating between supports and the loaded node reduces peak member stress. Efficient triangulation and using higher area_id for critical members is necessary. The structure must remain closed, and all nodes must be connected.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss using a symmetric, closed Warren truss with an additional top node above node_3 (to form a triangle), and intermediate nodes between supports and the load. This will distribute the load via multiple triangulated paths, reducing peak member stress. Use higher area_id for main diagonals and chords, and smaller area_id for less critical members. Keep node_1, node_2, and node_3 fixed; introduce node_4 and node_5 as top chord nodes to form a stable, closed truss.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A Warren truss with a top chord node above node_3 and two intermediate nodes between supports and load (forming two triangles) will efficiently split the applied load into multiple paths. This reduces the force in any single member. The structure will be statically determinate, closed, and all nodes will be connected. Members directly in the load path will be assigned higher area_id. The geometry (node positions) will be chosen to keep member lengths moderate and angles favorable for force distribution.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Steel truss, all joints pinned, load at node_3 (-10, -45 deg). Force in members estimated using method of joints and equilibrium. For a Warren truss, the force in diagonals and chords can be estimated by resolving the applied load through the triangles. Mass = sum(length × area). Stress = force / area. Use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for main diagonals and chords, \'1\' (0.195) for verticals. Node_4 and node_5 placed at (1.5,1.7) and (4.5,1.7) to create a shallow triangle above node_3, distributing the load evenly to supports. All nodes connected to form a closed truss.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Estimate member forces by resolving the 10kN load at node_3. In this geometry, diagonals and top chords share the load. Main diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_2) and bottom chords (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2) will see the highest forces. Assign area_id \'2\' (0.782) to these. Verticals and shorter diagonals (node_4-node_5, node_1-node_2) can use area_id \'1\' (0.195). Calculate member lengths and check total mass: all members are <6.0m, and with conservative area use, total mass <30. Estimated max stress for main members: force ≈ 10/sqrt(2) ≈ 7.07 kN per main diagonal, stress ≈ 7.07/0.782 ≈ 9.0 (<30). All constraints satisfied.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "All nodes are connected, structure is closed and triangulated, load paths are efficient, no member overstressed, total mass estimated below 30.
