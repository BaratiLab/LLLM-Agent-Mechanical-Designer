The current and historical designs are either too heavy or overstressed. The objective is to redesign the truss for constraint satisfaction and efficiency.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: minimize mass and stress. Constraints: max(abs(stress)) ≤ 30, total mass ≤ 30. Must keep node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 (load) fixed. All nodes must be connected. Prior attempts failed due to high mass (39) or overstress (up to 51).",\n\n    "analysis": "The current design uses 6 nodes and 13 members, with high mass (38.97) and max stress (5.97). Most historic structures are either too light (underdesigned, overstressed) or too heavy (overdesigned, under-stressed). The load is at node_3 (2.0, 0.0), angled -45°, which will create both vertical and horizontal components. The supports at node_1 (pinned, 0,0) and node_2 (roller, 6,0) define a 6m span. The most efficient structures in history use triangular arrangements but often lack vertical/horizontal bracing or use excessive cross-sectional area. The best mass among feasible stresses is 35.05 (still over the 30 limit). Closed truss geometry is vital for stability and constraint satisfaction.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Triangulated forms are most efficient, but member sizing needs to be optimized. Many members are oversized. The current 6-node, 13-member design is overbuilt. Reducing node count and optimizing member areas can reduce mass. Diagonal bracing is essential to resolve the -45° load. The top chord should be as short as possible for weight savings. A Warren truss (triangulated) or a Pratt truss (verticals and diagonals) can be effective. Avoid long, lightly-braced members. Use minimal area (area_id \'1\' or \'2\') where possible.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign as a compact, closed triangular truss with 5 nodes: supports at node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), load at node_3 (2,0), and two top nodes (node_4 and node_5) forming an upper chord. Connect all nodes with triangulation and minimal member count. Assign minimal area (area_id \'1\' or \'2\') to most members, increasing only if required for stress. Avoid heavy chords. Place top nodes just high enough to ensure triangulation and short member lengths.",\n\n    "reasoning": "A 5-node, 8-member (double triangle) truss will create a closed, efficient structure. The load at node_3 will be shared by diagonals to node_4 and node_5, distributing the -45° force efficiently. The top nodes will be placed symmetrically above node_3, forming two triangles with supports. This reduces bending moments and member lengths. Assign area_id \'1\' (0.195) for most members, area_id \'2\' (0.782) for diagonals if needed. This will ensure mass stays below 30 and stress below 30.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Steel truss, all members pinned. Calculate force in each member using method of joints. Estimate vertical height for top nodes (2.0m typical for 6m span). Member lengths: horizontal (2-3m), diagonals (~2.8m), verticals (2m). Mass = sum(length × area). For stress: F = P/(A*cosθ) for diagonals under -45° load. Choose area so that max stress < 30. Use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for diagonals, \'1\' for others. All nodes must be connected for closed structure.",\n\n    "calculation": "Top nodes at (2.0,2.0) and (4.0,2.0). Member lengths: node_1-node_2 (6.0m), node_1-node_4 (2.83m), node_2-node_5 (2.83m), node_4-node_5 (2.0m), node_3-node_4 (2.0m), node_3-node_5 (2.0m), node_1-node_3 (2.0m), node_2-node_3 (4.0m). Assign area_id \'2\' (0.782) to diagonals (node_3-node_4, node_3-node_5), \'1\' to others. Mass estimate: (6+2.83+2.83+2+2+2+2+4) × area (mostly 0.195, diagonals ×0.782). Total mass ≈ (6+2.83+2.83+2+2+2+2+4)×0.195 + 2×2×(0.782-0.195) = 23.6×0.195 + 2.348 = 4.60 + 2.348 = 6.95. Well under 30. Stress in diagonals: P=10kN at -45°, so each diagonal sees ~7.07kN.
