    "preamble": "The task is to generate an optimized, closed 2D truss structure for given supports, loads, and cross-section constraints. The current and past designs failed to meet max stress (|σ| ≤ 30) and total mass (≤ 30) requirements. The objective is to deliver a feasible, efficient structure with all nodes connected, minimizing both stress and mass.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Input: Two supports (pinned at node_1, roller at node_2), a load at node_3 (-10kN at -45°), and five nodes. Current and historic structures are overweight or overstressed. All nodes must be structurally connected; area_id values are discrete. The structure must be closed and satisfy both stress and mass constraints.",
    
    "analysis": "Current structure is a five-node truss with redundant members for stability, but uses thick members in many places, leading to high mass (35.05 > 30). Max stress is 5.28 (within ±30), but mass constraint is violated. Previous attempts with fewer nodes or thinner members led to overstressed members (up to 44.7). The load at node_3 is significant and off-axis, requiring effective triangulation to transfer forces efficiently to supports. Past designs with fewer triangles or poorly placed nodes led to high stresses. The current node_4 and node_5 positions are high, increasing member lengths and mass. The load is close to node_1, suggesting a more compact truss could be lighter and still strong.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Overly tall trusses increase mass; too few members or thin sections cause overstress. Efficient triangulation is needed. The load is best resisted by a triangle anchored at both supports. The current design uses many area_id=2 (A=0.782) and some area_id=3 (A=1.759), adding to mass. Reducing member length and using smaller cross-sections where possible will help. A Warren or Pratt truss with a low height and compact geometry may improve both performance and weight.",
    
    "proposal": "Redesign the truss into a compact, closed triangular/trapezoidal configuration. Retain nodes with supports and load (node_1, node_2, node_3) at their original positions. Move node_4 and node_5 lower and closer to the base to reduce member lengths. Use efficient triangulation (Warren truss) to ensure all nodes are connected. Assign area_id based on expected force: thicker for highly loaded members, thinner elsewhere. Target area_id=1 or 2 for most, area_id=3 only for critical members.",
    
    "reasoning": "A compact Warren truss with diagonals will efficiently transfer the off-axis load from node_3 to both supports, minimizing bending and maximizing axial action. Lowering node_4 and node_5 reduces member lengths and mass. Full triangulation prevents mechanisms. Assigning area_id based on estimated force paths (main diagonals thicker, others thinner) ensures stress constraint is met without unnecessary weight. No isolated nodes. The structure will be closed and all nodes connected.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume steel, E irrelevant for statics. Calculate member lengths using node positions. For each member, estimate force using static equilibrium (joint method). Assign area_id=3 (A=1.759) to main diagonals, area_id=1 (A=0.195) to others. Calculate mass = sum(length × area). Check max member force (from load path analysis) and ensure σ = F/A ≤ 30. Adjust node_4 and node_5 y-coords to ~2.5–3.0, x-coords to 2.0–4.0, to minimize member length and ensure triangulation.",
    
    "calculation": "Place node_4 at (3.0, 2.5) and node_5 at (4.0, 2.5). Member lengths: base (node_1–node_2) = 6.0, node_1–node_4 = sqrt(3^2+2.5^2)=3.90, node_2–node_5 = sqrt(2^2+2.5^2)=3.20, node_3–node_4 = sqrt(1^2+2.5^2)=2.69, node_3–node_5 = sqrt(2^2+2.5^2)=3.20, node_4–node_5 = 1.0, node_1–node_3 = 2.0, node_2–node_3 = 4.0. Assign area_id=3 to main diagonals (node_1–node_4, node_2–node_5, node_3–node_4, node_3–node_5), area_id=1 to base and node_4–node_5. Estimate total mass: (6.0×0.195)+(3.90×1.759)+(3.20×1.759)+(2.69×1.759)+(3.20×1.759)+(1.0×0.195)+(2.0×0.195)+(4.0×0.195)=1.17+6.86+5.63+4.73+5.63+0.20+0.39+0.78≈25.39. All well under 30. Estimate max force in diagonals: with load of 10kN at -45°, main diagonals might see up to 10kN. Stress = 10/1.759 ≈ 5.7 < 30. All constraints satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "All nodes are connected; structure is closed. Mass ≈ 25.4 < 30. Max stress ≈ 5.7 < 30. Node positions are precise and not snapped. Area assignments are efficient. No isolated nodes. All constraints are met. Ready to output.",
