The current structure exceeds the allowable stress constraint (|stress| ≤ 30) with a max member stress of 60.44. The objective is to generate a closed truss design that satisfies all constraints (stress and mass) while minimizing stress.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given: Nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), (2,2); supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller); load at node_3 (-10, -45°). Current structure is a quadrilateral with a diagonal. Constraints: |stress| ≤ 30, mass ≤ 30. Current design is over-stressed.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current truss is a basic rectangle with a vertical member and a diagonal tie. The load at node_3 is both downward and leftward, creating significant moment and shear. The most stressed member is member_1 (node_1 - node_3), which is highly compressed. The structure is not optimally triangulated; the diagonal (member_5) is not ideally placed to distribute the applied load efficiently. The load path from node_3 to the supports is not direct, causing high stress in horizontal members. The structure is closed but not optimally braced for the load orientation.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key insights: The main issue is excessive compressive stress in the bottom chord. The current rectangle is not efficiently triangulated to resist the off-axis load. Adding a second diagonal and/or repositioning node_4 can improve load distribution. Increasing area sizes alone would increase mass unnecessarily. A Warren truss (triangulated) or K-truss pattern may be more effective.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss to a fully triangulated (Warren-type) configuration. Add a fifth node above node_3 to create two triangles, allowing the load at node_3 to be shared by more members. Connect node_3 to node_4 (top), node_4 to node_2, and add a new member from node_4 to node_1. This configuration provides a direct load path to both supports and reduces stress concentration. Use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for diagonals and verticals, and \'1\' (0.195) for less loaded members to minimize mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation is key for truss efficiency. By adding a node above node_3 (say, node_5 at (2, 2.5)), the load can be distributed through two triangles, reducing stress in any single member. The vertical and diagonal members will carry axial forces more efficiently, and the structure remains closed. The new configuration ensures all nodes are connected and the load path is more direct. Area selection is based on expected force: higher for diagonals, lower for horizontal top/bottom chords.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All joints are pin-connected; self-weight is negligible compared to applied load. Calculate member forces using method of joints. Member length = sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2). Mass = sum(length × area). Assign area_id based on expected force. Target: keep max |stress| ≤ 30 and mass well below 30. Use geometry to minimize member lengths and maximize load sharing.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node_3 load: 10 kN at 45° = (Fx, Fy) = (-7.07, -7.07) kN. By raising node_4 to (2, 2.5), triangles are formed: (node_1, node_3, node_4), (node_3, node_2, node_4). Members: (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), (node_2-node_4), (node_4-node_1), (node_3-node_4). Add member (node_1-node_2) for closure. Estimated forces: diagonals carry major share; horizontals less. Assign area_id \'2\' (0.782) for diagonals/verticals, \'1\' for horizontals. Compute lengths: bottom/top chords = 6.0; vertical = 2.5; diagonals ≈ sqrt(2^2 + 2.5^2) ≈ 3.20. Mass ≈ (2×6×0.195) + (2×3.20×0.782) + (2.5×0.782) ≈ 2.34 + 5.01 + 1.96 ≈ 9.31 < 30. Stresses: load is now distributed among two triangles, estimated max member force ≈ 14.1 kN, stress ≈ 14.1/0.782 ≈ 18.0 < 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Final check: Structure is fully triangulated and closed.
