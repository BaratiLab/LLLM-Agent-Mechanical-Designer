    "preamble": "This problem requires the design of a minimal-stress, closed, fully-connected 2D truss using three given nodes, a single oblique load, and two supports. The aim is to minimize maximum member stress (<= ±30) and total mass (<= 30), using only specified cross-sectional areas and node positions.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three nodes in a line (node_1 at (0,0), node_3 at (2,0), node_2 at (6,0)), with a downward and leftward load at node_3, and supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). The truss must be closed and all nodes connected. Triangulation is necessary for stability and stress minimization. The structure must be lightweight and satisfy area constraints.",
    
    "analysis": "The nodes are collinear, so a simple triangle cannot be formed without introducing a new node. The load at node_3 (-10 at -45°) induces both horizontal and vertical reactions. Directly connecting all nodes results in a single line, which is unstable for 2D trusses. To close the structure and provide triangulation, a new node above the line (say, at (3,1.5)) is needed. Members should connect all original nodes and the new node to form two triangles, minimizing the force in each member. The member sizes must be chosen to keep stress under ±30 while keeping total mass under 30.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "The key is to introduce a new node above the base to form a stable, triangulated structure. The new node should be positioned symmetrically above the midspan to efficiently distribute the load. All nodes (original and new) must be connected in a closed loop. Member areas should be as small as possible to minimize mass, but large enough to keep stress below 30. The critical members are those directly in the load path (node_3 to new node, new node to supports).",
    
    "reasoning": "Adding a node above the line (at (3.0, 1.5)) allows for two triangles: (node_1, node_3, new_node) and (node_2, node_3, new_node). This geometry efficiently distributes the load at node_3 to both supports. All members are connected, forming a closed truss. Member areas are selected based on estimated force: members in primary load path (node_3 to new_node, new_node to supports) get larger areas, while diagonals get smaller ones.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All members are pin-jointed; self-weight is negligible. Calculate member forces using method of joints. Estimate load distribution: the oblique load at node_3 is split between the two triangles. Mass = sum (length × area). Choose area_ids to keep all member stresses <=30, and total mass <=30. Position of new node is (3.0, 1.5) for symmetry and optimal force angles.",
    
    "calculation": "Load at node_3: Fx = -10*cos(45°) ≈ -7.07, Fy = -10*sin(45°) ≈ -7.07. Geometry: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (3,1.5). Members: (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), (node_1-node_4), (node_2-node_4), (node_3-node_4). Estimate member lengths: node_1-node_3: 2.0, node_3-node_2: 4.0, node_1-node_4: sqrt(3^2+1.5^2)=3.35, node_2-node_4: sqrt(3^2+1.5^2)=3.35, node_3-node_4: sqrt(1^2+1.5^2)=1.80. Assign area_ids: main load path (node_3-node_4, node_4-node_1, node_4-node_2) get '2' (0.782), others get '1' (0.195). Mass = (2.0+4.0)*0.195 + 3.35*0.782*2 + 1.80*0.782 ≈ 1.17 + 5.24 + 1.41 ≈ 7.82 < 30. Estimated max member force ≈ 10, so stress = force/area ≈ 10/0.782 ≈ 12.8 < 30. All constraints satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "The design introduces a single new node above the base for triangulation. All members are assigned area_ids to keep stress and mass within limits. All nodes are connected in a closed loop, and no duplicate members exist. The design is efficient, stable, and satisfies all constraints.",
