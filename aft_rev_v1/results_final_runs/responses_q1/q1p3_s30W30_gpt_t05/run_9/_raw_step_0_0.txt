The truss must be fully connected, and optimal member areas must be selected from a discrete set.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes form a triangle; all must be connected. Applied load (10 units at -45°) on node_3, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Objective: triangulate, minimize stress, and stay under mass limit. Only three nodes, so closed truss is a triangle. Need to select optimal member areas for all three sides.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The three nodes are colinear on the x-axis (0,0), (2,0), (6,0), so a direct triangle is not possible unless a new node is introduced off the x-axis. However, instructions allow new nodes; thus, to form a closed triangulated truss, add a fourth node above the x-axis. The load at node_3 (-10, -45°) will generate both x and y components. The supports will resist vertical and horizontal reactions. Members must be sized to keep max stress within ±30, and total mass ≤30. The optimal configuration is a triangle with the fourth node above node_3, forming two triangles for rigidity.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Colinear nodes require a new node for closure and triangulation. Placing node_4 above node_3 creates two triangles: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_2-node_3-node_4. This allows efficient load transfer and keeps member lengths moderate. Area selection must balance stress and mass; thinner members may be overstressed, thicker ones may violate mass constraint.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Adding node_4 at (2.0, 2.0) above node_3 creates a symmetric, efficient truss. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_2-node_1 (base), node_3-node_4 (vertical), node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4. This configuration triangulates the structure, provides direct load paths, and distributes forces efficiently. Area selection for each member is based on estimated force (using static equilibrium) and stress constraint. Members carrying higher force (e.g., those directly under load) get larger area IDs.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: E = 1 (unitless, since only stress ratios matter), all forces in plane. Node_4 at (2.0, 2.0) is chosen for symmetry and short member lengths. Forces at node_3: Fx = -10*cos(45°) ≈ -7.07, Fy = -7.07. Members to check: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_2 (base), node_3-node_4 (vertical), node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4. Use method of joints to estimate member forces. For initial sizing, assign area_id \'2\' (0.782) to main members, upgrade to \'3\' (1.759) if stress exceeds 30. Calculate each member\'s length, force, stress = force/area, mass = length*area. Sum total mass, verify stress in all members ≤30.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1 (0.0, 0.0), node_2 (6.0, 0.0), node_3 (2.0, 0.0), node_4 (2.0, 2.0).

Assign area_id \'2\' (0.782) to all members except node_3-node_4, which takes more vertical load—assign area_id \'3\' (1.759). Estimated member forces (from symmetry and statics): node_3-node_4 ≈ 10 (vertical), node_1-node_3 ≈ 7, node_3-node_2 ≈ 7, others ≈ 5. Stress checks: 10/1.759 ≈ 5.7 < 30, 7/0.782 ≈ 9 < 30.
