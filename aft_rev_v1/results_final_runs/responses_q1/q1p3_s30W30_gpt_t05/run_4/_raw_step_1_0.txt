The current design is over-stressed (|stress|max = 39.89) and not constraint-satisfying. The objective is to create a closed, efficient truss that meets all constraints by adjusting member arrangement, areas, and possibly node positions (excluding supports/loads).",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "The structure has a concentrated load at node_3 (-10kN @ -45°), pinned/roller supports at nodes 1 and 2, and a rectangular-triangular layout. The main constraint violation is excessive compressive stress in member_2 (-39.89). The mass is well below the limit (10.49 < 30). Objective: reduce max member stress below 30 by design changes while keeping the structure closed and mass low.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current truss: nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), (2,2.5). Members connect all nodes, forming a closed structure. The most critical member is member_2 (node_1–node_3), with -39.89 stress, likely due to high compression from the angled load at node_3 and insufficient triangulation or cross-bracing. The structure is essentially a triangle with an elevated fourth node, but the load at node_3 (midspan, bottom chord) creates large compressive forces in short members. The structure is already light; the issue is force distribution, not mass.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key insight: The high compression in member_2 is due to the direct transfer of the load at node_3 through a short, nearly horizontal member. To distribute forces and reduce peak compression, we can (a) add a diagonal brace from node_3 to node_2 or node_4, (b) increase the area of member_2 (but that\'s inefficient), or (c) reposition node_4 for better triangulation. Since node positions with supports or loads can\'t be changed, consider adding a fifth node above node_3 to form a steeper triangle and introduce diagonals to share the load.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign by adding a fifth node above node_3 at (2.0, 1.5) to form a double triangle (Pratt truss style), and add new diagonals connecting node_3 to node_2 and node_5 to node_4. Adjust member areas to optimize stress distribution. Retain all original nodes and connections for closure and stability.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Adding node_5 above node_3 creates two smaller, steeper triangles, reducing the span of high-stress members and introducing new load paths. Diagonal bracing ensures load at node_3 is shared among more members, reducing the peak force in any single member. This follows truss optimization principles: triangulation, direct load paths, and short compression members. Member areas are assigned based on expected force magnitude, using larger areas for highly loaded members and smaller for less critical ones.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Steel truss, all joints pinned, static equilibrium. Forces at node_3 split between new diagonals and verticals. Members: bottom chord (node_1–node_3–node_2), top chord (node_1–node_4–node_2), verticals (node_3–node_5), diagonals (node_5–node_2, node_3–node_4). Use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for diagonals, \'1\' (0.195) for less loaded members, \'3\' (1.759) for bottom chord. Estimate: member_2 (was -39.89) now shares load with two diagonals, so expect stress reduction by factor ~2–3. Mass increases slightly but remains below 30.",\n\n    "calculation": "Force at node_3: -10kN @ -45° = (-7.07, -7.07) kN. With node_5 at (2.0, 1.5), vertical member_3–5 and diagonals 5–2, 5–4, the load is split. Assuming symmetry, each diagonal takes ~5kN, vertical takes ~5kN. For member_2 (node_1–node_3): new force ≈ -15kN × (old: -39.89/2.5). With area 1.759, stress = 15/1.759 ≈ 8.5 < 30. Mass: sum of (length × area) for all members, estimate < 18.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Verify: All nodes connected, structure closed, no isolated nodes. All member stresses < 30. Total mass < 30. No supports/loads moved. Node coordinates precise. Assign area_ids to match force paths.
