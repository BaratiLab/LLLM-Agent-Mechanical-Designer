All nodes must be connected in a single closed structure, and new nodes may be introduced for optimal load transfer and triangulation.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes form a base (nodes 1 and 2 at y=0) and a loaded node (node 3 at (2,0)). Load is applied at node 3 at -45°, so both x and y force components are present. Supports: node_1 is pinned, node_2 is roller. Objective is a closed, triangulated truss with minimal mass and stress. Area IDs are discrete. All constraints must be strictly satisfied.",\n    \n    "analysis": "With only three nodes in a line, a closed truss is impossible without adding at least one more node. To effectively transfer the diagonal load at node_3, and to close the truss, add a node above the base (e.g., above node_3) to form two triangles. This will allow direct diagonal members to carry the load efficiently, minimize bending, and ensure all nodes are connected. The load at node_3 (-10, -45°) splits to equal x and y components (~-7.07 each). The most effective structure is a triangle with a top node, forming two triangles: (node_1, node_3, new_node_4) and (node_2, node_3, new_node_4). Members: node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_2 (base), node_3-new_node_4, node_1-new_node_4, node_2-new_node_4. This forms a closed structure.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a node above node_3 (say at (2, 2.5)) allows for triangulation and direct force transfer from the loaded node. This node position is chosen to balance load paths and keep member lengths moderate, minimizing mass. All nodes will be connected, forming a closed truss. The load at node_3 will be shared between the diagonals to the supports and the new top node. The base (node_1-node_2) resists horizontal reactions. The truss is statically determinate.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation is essential for stability and stress minimization. Placing the new node vertically above node_3 ensures symmetric force distribution and efficient load transfer. Member areas will be assigned based on estimated forces: diagonals from node_3 to supports and to the new node will have slightly larger areas to avoid overstress, while the base can use a smaller area. The total member length and area will be checked to keep mass under 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All members are pin-connected; self-weight is neglected. Member forces estimated via method of joints. Key equations: For node_3 (loaded), sum forces in x and y = 0. For new node_4 (above node_3), vertical and diagonal members split load. Calculate member lengths using distance formula. Assign area IDs to ensure max force/area ≤ 30. Mass = sum(length × area). Try to keep areas minimal but sufficient for stress constraint.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node positions: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2,2.5). Member lengths: node_1-node_2: 6.00, node_1-node_3: 2.00, node_2-node_3: 4.00, node_3-node_4: 2.50, node_1-node_4: sqrt(2^2 + 2.5^2)=3.20, node_2-node_4: sqrt(4^2 + 2.5^2)=4.72. Assign area IDs: For main diagonals and vertical (node_3-node_4, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4), use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for low mass but adequate stress, for base and short members (node_1-node_2, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3) use area_id \'1\' (0.195). Estimate member forces: diagonals and verticals will carry most load, but with 0.782 area, max stress ~|force|/0.782 ≤ 30, so max force per member ≈ 23.5. With load of 10 at node_3, split between three members, max force per member ≈ 7-10. Total mass = (6.00+2.00+4.00)×0.195 + (2.50+3.20+4.72)×0.782 = (12.00)×0.195 + (10.42)×0.782 = 2.34 + 8.15 = 10.49 < 30. All constraints satisfied.
