    "preamble": "We are tasked with optimizing a closed 2D truss structure, currently satisfying all constraints, to further minimize maximum member stress while maintaining total mass below 30 and stress below ±30. The structure is loaded at node_3, supported at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller), and must remain closed and efficient.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "The initial structure is constraint-satisfying with max stress 9.04 and mass 23.21. The structure is already triangulated, with reasonable area allocation. The load at node_3 is substantial and off-axis, requiring effective force distribution.",
    
    "analysis": "Current design uses five nodes, with node_3 at (2,0) receiving the load. Members are well connected, forming two triangles above and below node_3. Most stresses are moderate, but members 6 and 7 (-9.04) are the most stressed, suggesting these diagonals are critical for carrying the load. Generation history shows a lighter but overstressed design, confirming the current design is more robust and constraint-compliant.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "The structure is well-closed and triangulated, but there is potential to reduce peak stresses by slightly adjusting the internal node positions (node_4 and node_5) to better align with force flow. The mass is well below the limit, so we have room to increase area in critical members if needed. No obvious redundancy or inefficiency.",
    
    "proposal": "Fine-tune node_4 and node_5 positions to optimize load path from node_3 to supports, reducing stress in diagonals. Slightly raise node_4 and adjust node_5 vertically to rebalance internal force distribution. Increase area of most stressed members (6/7) to further reduce peak stress, while keeping mass under 30.",
    
    "reasoning": "By raising node_4 (currently at (2,2.5)) slightly and increasing node_5's y-coordinate, we can make the top triangle more equilateral, reducing force concentrations in diagonals. Increasing area for members 6 and 7 (the most stressed) will directly lower their stress, leveraging available mass budget. This approach maintains closure, connectivity, and efficient triangulation.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume node_1, node_2, and node_3 positions are fixed (supports and load). Move node_4 to (2,2.8) and node_5 to (2,1.8) to distribute forces more evenly. Increase area_id for members 6 and 7 from '2' (0.782) to '3' (1.759). Recalculate member lengths, update mass, and estimate new stresses (expect reduction in max(abs(stress)) to ~7.5-8).",
    
    "calculation": "Updated node_4: (2.00, 2.80), node_5: (2.00, 1.80). Length member_6/7: |2.00,0.00 - 2.00,1.80| = 1.80m. Mass for each: 1.80*1.759 = 3.17. Total mass increases by (3.17-1.17)+(3.17-0.78)=4.39, new total ≈ 27.60. With area doubled, stress in members 6/7 drops to about -4.0. All other members unchanged, so max(abs(stress)) now ~7.72 (member_4). All constraints satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Design remains closed, all nodes connected. No isolated or floating nodes. Max stress reduced, mass within constraint. No further significant improvement possible without exceeding mass or making structure less efficient. Ready to finalize.",
    
    "stop": "True", # The design meets all constraints and further improvements would not significantly reduce stress without exceeding mass or altering the efficient topology.
