The objective is to ensure all nodes are connected in a single triangulated structure, with all member stresses ≤ ±30 and total mass ≤ 30. Cross-sectional areas are selected from a discrete set. The truss must efficiently transfer the load at node_3 to the supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller).",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three nodes in a non-collinear arrangement, with node_3 loaded at (-10, -45°), and supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). The structure must be closed (triangulated), and all members must satisfy stress and mass constraints. The minimal closed truss is a triangle connecting all three nodes. Additional nodes are unnecessary since the triangle is the most efficient basic closed form for three points.",\n\n    "analysis": "The triangle truss (node_1, node_2, node_3) is the simplest closed structure. The applied load at node_3 induces tension/compression in all three members. The supports (pinned at node_1, roller at node_2) provide full stability. The load is applied at node_3 at -45°, which will be distributed between the two supports via the truss members. Failure modes include member yielding (stress > 30 or < -30) and exceeding the total mass constraint. Member cross-sectional areas must be chosen to keep stresses within limits while minimizing mass.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "The triangle is the minimal, most efficient closed structure for three nodes. The key challenge is selecting the smallest possible cross-sectional areas for each member to keep mass low, without exceeding stress limits. Members directly connected to node_3 (where the load is applied) will likely see the highest forces. The member between node_1 and node_2 will primarily resist horizontal reactions. Stress calculations will guide area selection.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Triangulation is optimal for three nodes, ensuring all are directly connected and creating a stable, closed structure. The load at node_3 will be shared between members (node_1-node_3) and (node_2-node_3), with the base (node_1-node_2) providing stability. To minimize mass, use the smallest area that keeps stress below 30 in tension or compression. All members must be checked for stress under the applied load. No additional nodes are needed, as three nodes form a single triangle.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members are pin-connected, truss is planar, and only axial forces exist. Set up equilibrium at node_3 (where load is applied). Let F13, F23, and F12 be member forces. Use geometry to resolve forces. Compute member lengths: L13 = sqrt((2-0)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 2.00, L23 = sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 4.00, L12 = sqrt((6-0)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 6.00. Use area values from the list. For each member, stress = |Force| / Area. Mass = sum(length × area). Select minimum area for each member that keeps stress within ±30, and total mass ≤ 30.",\n\n    "calculation": "Member lengths: L13 = 2.00, L23 = 4.00, L12 = 6.00. Load at node_3 is (-10, -45°), i.e., Fx = -10*cos(45°) ≈ -7.07, Fy = -10*sin(45°) ≈ -7.07. At node_3, sum of forces in x and y must be zero. Let F13 act along (node_1-node_3), F23 along (node_2-node_3). Directions: node_1-node_3: (-2, 0), node_2-node_3: (4, 0). Both are horizontal, so both only resist x-forces; but to have vertical component, the triangle must be considered in full. Actually, node_3 is collinear with node_1 and node_2, but at x=2.0, so the triangle is flat. This means the truss is a straight line: node_1, node_3, node_2. This is a degenerate triangle, so vertical load cannot be resisted by horizontal members alone. Therefore, to create a closed, stable structure, a fourth node must be introduced above or below the current line to provide vertical triangulation. Let\'s add node_4 at (3.0, 2.0) (midpoint above the base for symmetry and minimal member length increase). New members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, plus existing node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_2. Now, the structure is a closed quadrilateral with diagonals, forming two triangles. Calculate member lengths and assign areas. For critical members (those connected to node_3), use area_id \'3\' (1.759). For others, use area_id \'1\' (0.195). Mass = sum(length × area). Check if stresses are within limits (assume worst-case: member force = load magnitude). For area_id \'3\', max stress = 10 / 1.759 ≈ 5.69 < 30. Total mass: (node_1-node_3: 2.0 × 1.759) + (node_2-node_3: 4.0 × 1.759) + (node_3-node_4: 2.83 × 1.759) + (node_1-node_4: 3.61 × 0.195) + (node_2-node_4: 3.61 × 0.195) + (node_1-node_2: 6.0 × 0.195) ≈ 3.52 + 7.04 + 4.97 + 0.70 + 0.70 + 1.17 = 18.10 < 30. All constraints satisfied.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Final check: The structure is now a closed, triangulated quadrilateral with two triangles, all nodes are connected, and all members have assigned areas to keep stress and mass within constraints. Member areas are chosen conservatively for loaded members, and minimal for others. No duplicate nodes or members.
