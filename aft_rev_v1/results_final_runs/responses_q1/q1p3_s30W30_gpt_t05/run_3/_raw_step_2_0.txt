The current structure is a closed, 4-node truss supporting a (-10 kN, -45°) load at node_3, with pinned and roller supports at nodes 1 and 2. The objective is to minimize the maximum absolute member stress (currently 12.0) and total mass (currently 17.95), while keeping all member stresses within ±30 and total mass ≤ 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The structure is constraint-satisfying. Loads and supports are clearly defined. The current design uses moderate area members (area_id \'2\'), and all nodes are connected in a closed, triangulated configuration. The structure is stable and statically determinate.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The truss forms a closed quadrilateral with diagonals, ensuring stability. The highest stress is -12.00 in member_2 (node_1-node_3), which is well below the ±30 limit. The mass is also well below the constraint. The load at node_3 is downward and left, so load paths from node_3 to both supports (nodes 1 and 2) are critical. Member_2 and member_6 (node_3-node_4) are the most stressed. All members use area_id \'2\' (0.782), which may be conservative for lightly loaded members (e.g., member_3). Historic lighter designs failed stress constraints. There is potential to reduce mass by optimizing member areas, especially where stresses are low.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Members with low stress (e.g., member_3: 0.39, member_1: -3.74) can use smaller areas. Members with higher stress (e.g., member_2: -12.00, member_4: 9.01, member_6: -9.64) should retain area_id \'2\' or higher. Node positions are already efficient; moving node_4 higher would increase vertical components and reduce compressive forces, but the current configuration is already close to optimal given constraints.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Retain the current node positions (as they are already efficient and fixed by supports/loads), but optimize member areas based on actual stress. Assign the smallest area that keeps max stress below ±30 and provides a safety margin. This will reduce total mass while maintaining all constraints.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By tuning member areas to match their stress demands, mass can be reduced without increasing max stress. Members with low stress can use area_id \'1\' (0.195). Members with moderate stress can use area_id \'2\' (0.782). Members with highest stress can use area_id \'3\' (1.759) if needed, but current max stress is only 12.0, so area_id \'2\' suffices for all. For very low-stress members, area_id \'1\' is justified. Node positions are not changed to preserve boundary/support/load conditions and efficient load path geometry.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Member stress = Force / Area. For each member, select the smallest area_id such that abs(stress) < 30. For example, for member_3 (0.39 kN), area_id \'1\' gives stress = 0.39/0.195 = 2.0, which is safe. For member_2 (-12.00 kN), area_id \'2\' gives stress = -12.00/0.782 = -15.35, which is also safe. Calculate each member\'s mass as length × area. Update total mass and verify all constraints.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Assign area_id \'1\' (0.195) to member_3 (0.39 kN), member_1 (-3.74 kN), and member_5 (4.51 kN). Assign area_id \'2\' (0.782) to member_2 (-12.00 kN), member_4 (9.01 kN), and member_6 (-9.64 kN). Calculate member lengths using node coordinates: member_1 (node_1-node_2): 6.00 m, member_2 (node_1-node_3): 2.00 m, member_3 (node_2-node_3): 4.00 m, member_4 (node_1-node_4): sqrt(3.0^2+2.7^2)=4.03 m, member_5 (node_2-node_4): sqrt(3.0^2+2.7^2)=4.03 m, member_6 (node_3-node_4): sqrt(1.0^2+2.7^2)=2.87 m. Compute mass for each member and sum. All stresses remain below ±30, and mass is further reduced.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "All node positions conform to constraints (supports/loads fixed, geometry efficient).
