    "preamble": "This is a 2D truss optimization problem. The current structure is a closed, 4-node truss supporting a (-10 kN, -45°) load at node_3, with pinned and roller supports at nodes 1 and 2. The objective is to minimize the maximum absolute member stress (currently 12.0) and total mass (currently 17.95), while keeping all member stresses within ±30 and total mass ≤ 30.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "The structure is constraint-satisfying. Loads and supports are clearly defined. The current design uses moderate area members (area_id '2'), and all nodes are connected in a closed, triangulated configuration. The structure is stable and statically determinate.",
    
    "analysis": "The truss forms a closed quadrilateral with diagonals, ensuring stability. The highest stress is -12.00 in member_2 (node_1-node_3), which is well below the ±30 limit. The mass is also well below the constraint. The load at node_3 is downward and left, so load paths from node_3 to both supports (nodes 1 and 2) are critical. Member_2 and member_6 (node_3-node_4) are the most stressed. All members use area_id '2' (0.782), which may be conservative for lightly loaded members (e.g., member_3). Historic lighter designs failed stress constraints. There is potential to reduce mass by optimizing member areas, especially where stresses are low.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Members with low stress (e.g., member_3: 0.39, member_1: -3.74) can use smaller areas. Members with higher stress (e.g., member_2: -12.00, member_4: 9.01, member_6: -9.64) should retain area_id '2' or higher. Node positions are already efficient; moving node_4 higher would increase vertical components and reduce compressive forces, but the current configuration is already close to optimal given constraints.",
    
    "proposal": "Retain the current node positions (as they are already efficient and fixed by supports/loads), but optimize member areas based on actual stress. Assign the smallest area that keeps max stress below ±30 and provides a safety margin. This will reduce total mass while maintaining all constraints.",
    
    "reasoning": "By tuning member areas to match their stress demands, mass can be reduced without increasing max stress. Members with low stress can use area_id '1' (0.195). Members with moderate stress can use area_id '2' (0.782). Members with highest stress can use area_id '3' (1.759) if needed, but current max stress is only 12.0, so area_id '2' suffices for all. For very low-stress members, area_id '1' is justified. Node positions are not changed to preserve boundary/support/load conditions and efficient load path geometry.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Member stress = Force / Area. For each member, select the smallest area_id such that abs(stress) < 30. For example, for member_3 (0.39 kN), area_id '1' gives stress = 0.39/0.195 = 2.0, which is safe. For member_2 (-12.00 kN), area_id '2' gives stress = -12.00/0.782 = -15.35, which is also safe. Calculate each member's mass as length × area. Update total mass and verify all constraints.",
    
    "calculation": "Assign area_id '1' (0.195) to member_3 (0.39 kN), member_1 (-3.74 kN), and member_5 (4.51 kN). Assign area_id '2' (0.782) to member_2 (-12.00 kN), member_4 (9.01 kN), and member_6 (-9.64 kN). Calculate member lengths using node coordinates: member_1 (node_1-node_2): 6.00 m, member_2 (node_1-node_3): 2.00 m, member_3 (node_2-node_3): 4.00 m, member_4 (node_1-node_4): sqrt(3.0^2+2.7^2)=4.03 m, member_5 (node_2-node_4): sqrt(3.0^2+2.7^2)=4.03 m, member_6 (node_3-node_4): sqrt(1.0^2+2.7^2)=2.87 m. Compute mass for each member and sum. All stresses remain below ±30, and mass is further reduced.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "All node positions conform to constraints (supports/loads fixed, geometry efficient). All members are connected, no isolated nodes. Member areas are optimized for stress, minimizing mass. All constraints are satisfied. No further meaningful reduction possible without violating constraints or efficiency.",
    
    "stop": "True", # All constraints met, mass minimized by area optimization, node geometry already efficient and fixed by boundary/loads. No further improvement possible.
