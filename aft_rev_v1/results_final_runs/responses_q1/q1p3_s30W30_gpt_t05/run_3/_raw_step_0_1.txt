The design must ensure all nodes are connected and the structure is statically and structurally efficient under the applied load.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs specify three colinear nodes: node_1 (pinned, 0,0), node_2 (roller, 6,0), node_3 (loaded, 2,0). The applied load on node_3 is (-10, -45°), i.e., with both x and y components. The structure must be closed (triangulated), so at least one new node is needed off the x-axis. The truss must be light and have low stresses. Area selection is discrete; mass is length × area sum. All connections must be unique and reference existing nodes.",\n    \n    "analysis": "With three colinear nodes, a basic triangle is required for closure and triangulation. The load on node_3 is downward and to the left, requiring efficient load transfer to both supports. Adding a fourth node above the x-axis (forming a triangle) will provide triangulation and direct load paths. The critical members will be those connecting node_3 to the supports and to the new node. The structure must resist both compression and tension, and member areas must be chosen to keep all member stresses within ±30, while total mass remains ≤ 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The optimal place for the fourth node is above the x-axis, likely near the centroid of the triangle formed by the supports and the loaded node, to minimize member lengths and distribute forces efficiently. This layout will allow short, direct load paths and proper triangulation. Stress will be highest in members directly opposing the applied load, so these may require larger cross-sectional areas. Efficient use of the smallest adequate area will minimize mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "To achieve a closed, triangulated truss, introduce node_4 at (3.0, 2.5) (above the midpoint between the supports). Connect all nodes to form two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4). This configuration provides direct load paths from node_3 to both supports and effective triangulation. Choose the smallest area IDs that satisfy the stress constraint for each member, prioritizing members carrying the largest force for larger areas if necessary.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume E = 1 (since only stress and mass matter here). Calculate load components at node_3: Fx = -10*cos(45°) ≈ -7.07, Fy = -10*sin(45°) ≈ -7.07. Calculate geometry: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (3.0, 2.5). Members: (node_1-node_3), (node_2-node_3), (node_1-node_4), (node_2-node_4), (node_3-node_4). Compute lengths. Use method of joints for equilibrium at node_3 and node_4. Start with area_id \'2\' (0.782) for members likely to have higher force, area_id \'1\' (0.195) for less loaded members, and increase if stress exceeds 30.
