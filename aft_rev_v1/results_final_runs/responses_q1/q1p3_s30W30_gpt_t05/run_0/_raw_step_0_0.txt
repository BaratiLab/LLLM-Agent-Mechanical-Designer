The objective is to minimize member stresses while keeping total mass under 30 and ensuring all member stresses are within ±30. The design must be fully connected and triangulated, with area selections from a discrete set.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes are given: two at the base (0,0) and (6,0), and one at (2,0) with a load of 10 units at -45°. Supports are pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. The structure must be fully closed, so a triangle is required. The load path suggests a need to transfer vertical and horizontal forces efficiently to supports. Mass and stress constraints are strict, requiring careful area assignment.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Node_3 is loaded and lies between the two supports. The most efficient way to close the truss and maintain triangulation is to add a fourth node above the base, forming a triangle with the three base nodes. This classic Pratt or Warren truss form allows for direct load transfer and minimizes bending. The load at node_3 will be resolved into horizontal and vertical components. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) mean horizontal and vertical reactions are possible at node_1, but only vertical at node_2. Potential failure modes include excessive stress in the diagonal or vertical members, so area selection is critical.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a fourth node above the base (around x=3.0, y=h) creates a stable triangle. For symmetry and optimal load path, place node_4 above node_3. Height h is chosen to minimize member lengths while improving force distribution. This also helps to reduce the required area for the most heavily loaded members, keeping mass low. All members will be checked for stress and mass constraints.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation is essential for stability and stress minimization. Placing node_4 at (3.0, 2.0) (midway between node_1 and node_2, slightly above the base) creates two symmetric triangles. This configuration ensures direct load transfer from node_3 to both supports via node_4, reducing member forces. The vertical and diagonal members will be sized based on estimated force magnitudes. All nodes are connected, forming a closed truss.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume node_4 at (3.0, 2.0). Members: (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), (node_1-node_4), (node_2-node_4), (node_3-node_4). Calculate member lengths. Resolve the 10-unit load at node_3 into x and y components: Fx= -10*cos(45°)= -7.07, Fy= -10*sin(45°)= -7.07. Use joint equilibrium at node_3 and node_4 to estimate member forces. Assign minimum area to lightly loaded members, larger area to most loaded. Check mass: sum(length × area). Ensure all member stresses <30.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_2 = 4.0, node_1-node_4 = sqrt(3^2 + 2^2)=3.61, node_2-node_4 = sqrt(3^2 + 2^2)=3.61, node_3-node_4 = sqrt(1^2 + 2^2)=2.24. Assume the main diagonal (node_3-node_4) carries the bulk of the load. Distribute load using method of joints: estimate max force in node_3-node_4 as ~10 units. To keep stress <30, area ≥ 10/30 = 0.34, so use area_id \'2\' (0.782). Assign area_id \'1\' (0.195) to less loaded members. Mass = 2.0*0.195 + 4.0*0.195 + 3.61*0.195 + 3.61*0.195 + 2.24*0.782 ≈ 0.39+0.78+0.70+0.70+1.75=4.32. Well below mass constraint. All stresses estimated <30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Structure is fully connected and closed. All nodes are unique and all members reference existing nodes.
