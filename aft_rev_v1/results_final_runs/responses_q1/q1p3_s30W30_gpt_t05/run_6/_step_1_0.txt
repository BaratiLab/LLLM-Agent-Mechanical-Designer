    "preamble": "The task is to redesign a 2D truss structure with four nodes (two supports, one loaded node) to minimize stress and mass while meeting constraints: max|stress| ≤ 30 and total mass ≤ 30. The current structure is over-stressed (max|stress|=55.6), though mass is acceptable. The goal is to generate a closed, constraint-satisfying truss.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Starting with the provided node positions and member connections. The current design is a quadrilateral (nodes 1-2-4-1) with a diagonal (node_3-node_4). The main issue is excessive compressive stress in member_1 (node_1-node_3). The objective is to reduce this stress below 30 by improving load distribution and member sizing.",
    
    "analysis": "Supports: node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Load: node_3, (-10, -45°), i.e., a downward and leftward force. The current structure forms a single bay with a top chord (node_2-node_4-node_1) and a bottom chord (node_1-node_3-node_2), with a diagonal (node_3-node_4). The highest stress is in member_1 (node_1-node_3), likely due to insufficient triangulation and inefficient force paths. The structure is closed, but the stress is not distributed efficiently, and the diagonal's area is small. The structure history only includes this design, which does not meet constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "The main stress issue is in the bottom chord (node_1-node_3). The diagonal (node_3-node_4) could be more effective if the structure is better triangulated. Adding a second diagonal (node_2-node_4) would create two triangles, improving the load path. Increasing the area of the most stressed member is also an option, but the current area_id=1 (0.195) is already small; using a larger area is feasible since mass is not a constraint. Alternatively, repositioning node_4 closer to the load could help, but node positions with supports and loads are fixed.",
    
    "proposal": "Redesign the structure to form two triangles by adding a diagonal from node_2 to node_4. Increase the cross-sectional area of the most stressed members (node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2) to area_id=2 (0.782). Keep existing nodes, as supports and loads are fixed. This should lower stress in all members by providing alternate load paths and larger areas.",
    
    "reasoning": "Adding the diagonal (node_2-node_4) creates a Warren truss (two triangles), which is efficient for handling oblique loads. Increasing the member areas for the bottom chord distributes the load better, reducing stress. This approach keeps the structure closed and symmetric, ensuring all nodes are connected. The new configuration should reduce the max|stress| below 30, as load is now shared by more members and critical members are stronger.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All joints are pinned, members are only loaded axially. Use area_id=2 (0.782) for bottom chord and diagonals, area_id=1 (0.195) for top chord. Member forces estimated via method of joints; load at node_3 splits between bottom chord and diagonals. Mass is calculated as sum(length × area). For each member, stress = force/area. For a typical triangle with 45° load, stresses should drop by ~50% with doubled load paths and larger areas.",
    
    "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3: 2.00m; node_3-node_2: 4.00m; node_2-node_4: sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-2.5)^2) ≈ 4.72m; node_4-node_1: sqrt((2-0)^2 + (2.5-0)^2) ≈ 3.20m; node_3-node_4: sqrt((2-2)^2 + (0-2.5)^2) = 2.50m. Assign area_id=2 (0.782) to node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_2-node_4, and node_3-node_4; area_id=1 (0.195) to node_4-node_1. Mass: (2.00+4.00+4.72+2.50)×0.782 + 3.20×0.195 ≈ (13.22×0.782)+(3.20×0.195) ≈ 10.34+0.62=10.96 < 30. Stress: With doubled load path and increased area, expect max|stress| < 30.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "All nodes are connected, structure is closed. Mass is well under 30. The most stressed members have increased area, and load paths are improved. The structure should now satisfy all constraints. No isolated nodes or duplicate members. All node coordinates are precise floats.",
