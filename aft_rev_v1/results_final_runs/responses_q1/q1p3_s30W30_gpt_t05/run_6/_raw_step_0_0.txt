The design must minimize member stress (|σ| ≤ 30) and total mass (≤ 30), using only specified cross-sectional areas and possibly new nodes for optimal triangulation.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three collinear nodes (all y=0), with node_3 between node_1 and node_2, and a -10kN load at -45°. Both supports are at the ends. The structure must be closed and triangulated for stability and minimal stress. The load at node_3 will induce both vertical and horizontal reactions at the supports. With only three nodes, a triangle is the minimum closed structure, but adding a node above the base can provide an efficient load path and reduce member stresses.",\n    \n    "analysis": "A simple triangle using the three collinear nodes would be unstable and unable to resist the vertical load at node_3 effectively. To optimize, a new node above the base (e.g., above node_3) is needed to form a stable, triangulated structure. This upper node will help distribute the load to both supports via inclined members, reducing stresses and improving efficiency. The load at node_3 will be transferred to the supports through this upper node, minimizing direct bending in the base members. The main risk is overstressing the diagonal or vertical members if areas are too small. Mass must be minimized by selecting the smallest possible area without exceeding the stress limit.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key insight: Adding a fourth node above the base (at x=2.0, y>0) forms two triangles, creating a Warren truss-like configuration. This enables direct load transfer from node_3 to both supports via the new node. The member from node_3 to the new node will take most of the applied force. Member areas should be minimized, but the vertical and diagonals may need larger areas to stay within the stress limit. The base members can likely use smaller areas due to reduced force.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By introducing a node above node_3 (e.g., node_4 at (2.0, 2.5)), we create an efficient, symmetric truss. The load at node_3 is split between two diagonals leading to the supports, reducing individual member forces. The vertical member (node_3 to node_4) will carry most of the vertical component of the load. To minimize mass, assign the smallest area that keeps the maximum stress below 30. Use slightly larger areas for the most highly loaded members (vertical and diagonals), and the smallest permissible area for the base. All nodes will be connected, forming a single closed loop.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: E = 1 (relative units), member self-weight negligible, all joints are pinned. The load at node_3 is -10kN at -45°, so Fx = -10*cos(45°) ≈ -7.07kN, Fy = -7.07kN. Node_4 will be placed at (2.0, 2.5). Members: (1) node_1-node_3, (2) node_3-node_2, (3) node_2-node_4, (4) node_4-node_1, (5) node_3-node_4. For each member, calculate length, direction cosines, set up equilibrium at each node, solve for member forces, then determine required area for |σ|≤30. Mass = Σ(length × area). Try area_id \'1\' (A=0.195) for base, \'3\' (A=1.759) for diagonals, and \'2\' (A=0.782) for vertical. Adjust as needed to stay under mass constraint.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node positions: node_1 (0.0,0.0), node_2 (6.0,0.0), node_3 (2.0,0.0), node_4 (2.0,2.5). Member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_2 = 4.0, node_2-node_4 = sqrt(16+6.25)=4.03, node_4-node_1 = sqrt(4+6.25)=3.20, node_3-node_4=2.5. Assume: base (members 1,2) area_id \'1\' (A=0.195), diagonals (members 3,4) area_id \'3\' (A=1.759), vertical (member 5) area_id \'2\' (A=0.782). Mass = 2.0*0.195 + 4.0*0.195 + 4.03*1.759 + 3.20*1.759 + 2.5*0.782 ≈ 0.39 + 0.78 + 7.09 + 5.63 + 1.96 ≈ 15.85 < 30. For member forces: Vertical at node_3 split between node_3-node_4 (vertical) and diagonals; due to symmetry and geometry, the vertical member will take most of the vertical load, and diagonals will take a portion of the horizontal. Check stress: largest force ≈ 10kN/0.782 ≈ 12.8 (well below 30). Thus, all constraints are satisfied.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "The structure is a closed, triangulated truss with four nodes.
