The structure must support a -10kN load at node_3 (2.0, 0.0) at -45°, with pinned and roller supports at node_1 (0.0, 0.0) and node_2 (6.0, 0.0). Previous iterations failed due to overstressed members (>30 MPa). The objective is to optimize geometry and member areas for a feasible, efficient truss.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives: Minimize stress and mass, ensure closed connectivity, and satisfy all constraints. The first iteration\'s structure was a basic quadrilateral with a diagonal; stress exceeded limits, especially in member_4. Need to triangulate and possibly adjust node_4\'s position for better force distribution.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Given the load at node_3 directed down and left, node_1 and node_2 as supports, and node_4 at (2.0, 2.5), the current structure forms a quadrilateral with a diagonal. The load path mainly goes from node_3 to the supports via node_4. Member_4 (node_4 to node_1) is overstressed (30.96), indicating poor force distribution or insufficient triangulation. Both historic structures violate constraints (max stress 30.96 and 55.6). Current area assignments may also be suboptimal.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The stress concentration in member_4 suggests the need for improved triangulation. Adding a diagonal between node_2 and node_1 (closing the lower chord) can help redistribute forces. Increasing the height of node_4 improves the truss\'s ability to resist vertical and horizontal components. Member areas may be slightly increased for highly loaded members, but staying close to minimum mass is preferable.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss by raising node_4 to (2.0, 3.2) for a steeper, more efficient top chord, and add a new node_5 at (4.0, 2.5) to create two triangles above the bottom chord. Members will connect all nodes to form a closed, triangulated structure. Assign area_id based on expected force: use \'2\' (0.782) for diagonals and top chords, \'1\' (0.195) for less loaded, and \'3\' (1.759) for bottom chords. This should yield a feasible, light, and robust truss.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation is key for stability and efficient force transfer. By raising node_4 and introducing node_5, the span is divided into two triangles, reducing member length and stress. The new geometry ensures that the load at node_3 is shared between two top chords and two diagonals, lowering peak stresses. Area assignments are matched to anticipated force magnitude to minimize mass while ensuring safety.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All joints are pinned. Member forces estimated by method of joints; critical members are those directly between loaded node and supports. Mass = sum(length × area) for all members. Node_4 moved to (2.0, 3.2) and node_5 added at (4.0, 2.5). Members: bottom chord (node_1-node_3-node_2), top chord (node_4-node_5), diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_3-node_5, node_2-node_5), vertical (node_3-node_4, node_3-node_5).",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3: 2.0m; node_3-node_2: 4.0m; node_1-node_4: sqrt(2.0^2+3.2^2)=3.78m; node_3-node_4: 3.2m; node_2-node_5: sqrt(2.0^2+2.5^2)=3.20m; node_3-node_5: 2.5m; node_4-node_5: sqrt(2.0^2+0.7^2)=2.12m. Assigning area_id \'2\' (0.782) to diagonals and verticals, \'1\' (0.195) to less loaded, \'3\' (1.759) to bottom chord. Mass = Σ(length × area). Max member force estimated to be <30kN per triangle. Total mass ≈ (2.0+4.0)×1.759 + (3.78+3.2+3.2+2.5+2.12)×0.782 ≈ 10.55 < 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "All nodes are connected; structure is closed and triangulated.
