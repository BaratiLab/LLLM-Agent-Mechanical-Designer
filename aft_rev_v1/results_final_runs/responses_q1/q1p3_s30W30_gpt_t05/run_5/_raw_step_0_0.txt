The design must use given cross-sectional areas and keep max stress within ±30 and mass under 30 units.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes at (0,0), (6,0), and (2,0). Node 1 is pinned, node 2 is roller, node 3 has a significant (-10, -45°) load. We must connect all nodes in a closed truss, possibly with additional nodes to enable triangulation and direct load transfer. Constraints on max stress and mass are strict.",\n    \n    "analysis": "With only three colinear nodes, a direct connection would not form a stable, closed truss. The load on node_3 is downward and leftward; the supports are both at y=0. To create a stable, triangulated structure, an additional node above the base is needed. This will allow for a triangle, distributing the load efficiently and reducing individual member stress. The load path should go from node_3 to the new node and then to both supports. Member areas must be chosen to keep stress <30 and mass <30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation is essential for stability and minimal stress. Placing a new node (node_4) above node_3, say at (2.0, 2.5), creates a triangle with the base (node_1-node_2). This allows for three main members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, and base members node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3. Efficient area assignment is critical to keep mass and stress within constraints.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Adding node_4 at (2.0, 2.5) creates two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4), ensuring closure and stability. Members from supports to node_4 will help carry vertical and horizontal components of the load. The base members (node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3) provide additional stiffness. Area selection will prioritize the members with highest load for larger sections, others get minimal area.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume E=1 for simplicity. Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_4: sqrt(2^2+2.5^2)=3.20, node_2-node_4: sqrt(4^2+2.5^2)=4.72, node_3-node_4: 2.5, node_1-node_3: 2.0, node_2-node_3: 4.0. Assign area: main diagonals get area_id \'2\' (0.782), base get \'1\' (0.195). Estimate forces: load splits to both diagonals, assume ~7 units per diagonal. Stress = F/A, so 7/0.782=8.96 <30.

Mass: (3.20+4.72+2.50)*0.782 + (2.00+4.00)*0.195 = (10.42*0.782)+(6.00*0.195)=8.15+1.17=9.32 <30. Max force per main member ~7, stress=7/0.782=8.96<30.
