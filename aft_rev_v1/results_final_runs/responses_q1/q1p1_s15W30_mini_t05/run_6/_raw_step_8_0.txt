Objective is to minimize max stress and total mass while satisfying max stress ±15 and mass ≤30 constraints.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 6.03 < 15 and mass 28.6262 < 30, so constraints are met. Load applied at node_3 downward-left, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Members connect nodes forming a closed shape with diagonal member_7. Cross-sectional areas vary from 2 to 3 mostly. Structure is stable and all nodes connected.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure efficiently distributes load with triangulation via member_7 (node_3-node_5). Highest compressive stresses near members 1 and 2 (~6.03), indicating critical load paths. Member_4 (node_3-node_2) carries zero stress, indicating possible area reduction or removal candidate. Mass is close to limit, so reducing unnecessary area or slightly repositioning nodes to reduce member lengths could reduce mass and stress. Node_3 is loaded and fixed in position; node_1 and node_2 are supports and fixed. Nodes 4 and 5 can be adjusted slightly to optimize geometry. History shows attempts with larger areas increase mass without stress improvement; smaller areas increase stress beyond limits.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Member_4 zero stress suggests area reduction to minimum or removal if stability maintained. Node_5 position can be slightly adjusted to reduce member lengths of members 5, 6, and 7 without violating constraints. Member areas around 2 to 3 are effective; avoid large areas to keep mass low. Triangulation is essential for stability and stress distribution. Maintain closed structure with all nodes connected.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Retain current node positions for supports and load nodes. Slightly move node_5 closer to node_2 and node_4 to reduce member lengths and stresses. Reduce area of member_4 to minimum (area_id \'1\' = 0.195) since it carries zero stress. Adjust areas of members 1 and 2 to slightly smaller values to reduce mass without exceeding max stress. Keep triangulation member_7 with moderate area to maintain stability. This fine-tuning aims to reduce mass and stress while respecting constraints.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Reducing member_4 area reduces unnecessary mass as it carries no load. Slight repositioning of node_5 towards (5.80, 2.90) shortens members 5, 6, 7, reducing stress and mass. Members 1 and 2 areas can be reduced from 3 (1.759) to 2 (0.782) to reduce mass, as their stresses are near but below limits. Node_4 remains at (2.00, 3.00) for stability. Symmetry and triangulation are preserved. Load path from node_3 to supports is maintained via members 1, 2, 7.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elasticity, uniform material density, stress proportional to force/area. Calculate member lengths from node coordinates. Mass = sum(length × area). Stress estimated by force/area; forces from load equilibrium. Member_4 area set to 0.195 to minimize mass without load. Node_5 moved from (6.00, 3.00) to (5.80, 2.90). Areas: member_1 and member_2 set to 0.782, member_3 and member_5 kept at 1.759, member_6 at 0.782, member_7 at 0.782.
