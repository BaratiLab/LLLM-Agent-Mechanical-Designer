    "preamble": "The current truss structure at iteration 6/25 violates the max stress constraint (±15) with max stress ~19.79 and has a total mass of 23.06, which is within mass limit. The objective is to generate a closed 2D truss structure that satisfies both max stress ≤ ±15 and total mass ≤ 30, minimizing stress while maintaining supports and load positions fixed.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given load is a -10 unit force at node_3 at -45°, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller), nodes mainly aligned on base (y=0) and top nodes at ~3m height. Current max stress is driven by member_7 (node_3 to node_5) with high tensile stress (-19.79). The mass is acceptable but stress exceeds limits. History shows best feasible design had max stress ~6.03 but higher mass (~28.6). The current design has a lightly loaded base but weak diagonal tension member causing stress violation.",
    
    "analysis": "The load at node_3 (-10 at -45°) induces tension in diagonal members from node_3 to top nodes and compression in base members. The current member_7 from node_3 to node_5 is overstressed due to insufficient cross-sectional area ('1' = 0.195) and possibly long length (5.8,3.1). The base members and vertical members have moderate stresses. The historical best design uses node_5 at (6.0,3.0) instead of (5.8,3.1), and assigns larger cross sections (area_id '2' or '3') to diagonal members, reducing stress. The structure is a closed truss with triangulation, which efficiently distributes loads. The current design's diagonal member_7 is too slender and too long, causing stress violation. Also, member_4 (node_3-node_2) has small cross section ('1') causing minimal support reaction transfer.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: increasing cross section on key diagonals reduces stress; positioning node_5 directly above node_2 (at x=6.0) improves load path symmetry and reduces eccentricity; using triangulation with members node_1-node_4 and node_4-node_5 stabilizes the top chord. Concern: member_7 length and area must be balanced to reduce stress. Insight: use proven historic design with node_5 at (6.0,3.0), assign area_id '2' or '3' to diagonal members, and keep base members sufficiently strong (area_id '3').",
    
    "proposal": "Adopt the historic best design with node_5 at (6.0, 3.0), keep node_1 and node_2 fixed at base, node_3 at (2.0, 0.0), node_4 at (2.0, 3.0). Use a closed truss with members connecting node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4, node_5 forming triangulated panels. Assign cross sections to keep max stress ≤ ±15 and total mass ≤ 30, prioritizing larger areas on diagonals and base chords for load distribution.",
    
    "reasoning": "Symmetry and triangulation ensure stable load paths and reduce bending. Positioning node_5 vertically above node_2 (x=6.0) reduces eccentricity and bending moments. Increasing cross section of critical diagonals (node_3-node_5, node_3-node_2) reduces stress. Base chord members (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2) with moderate area provide stable support. Top chord members (node_4-node_5, node_4-node_1) maintain geometric stability. This approach balances stress and mass effectively.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members are axial force only, linear elastic behavior, load applied at node_3 at -45°. Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance. Member mass = length × area (area from area_id table). Stress proportional to axial force / area. Use area_id '3' (1.759) for base chords and top chords, '2' (0.782) for diagonals except the critical diagonal node_3-node_5 which uses '2' or '3' depending on stress. Total mass sum must be ≤30. Calculate forces by static equilibrium (sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, sum moments=0).",
    
    "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1 (0.0,0.0), node_2 (6.0,0.0), node_3 (2.0,0.0), node_4 (2.0,3.0), node_5 (6.0,3.0). Member lengths: m1 (node_1-node_3): 2.0m, m2 (node_3-node_4): 3.0m, m3 (node_4-node_1): sqrt(2^2+3^2)=3.606m, m4 (node_3-node_2): 4.0m, m5 (node_4-node_5): 4.0m, m6 (node_2-node_5): 3.0m, m7 (node_3-node_5): sqrt(4^2+3^2)=5.0m. Assign areas: m1=3(1.759), m2=2(0.782), m3=3(1.759), m4=2(0.782), m5=3(1.759), m6=2(0.782), m7=2(0.782). Mass sum = sum(length × area): 2×1.759 + 3×0.782 + 3.606×1.759 + 4×0.782 + 4×1.759 + 3×0.782 + 5×0.782 = 3.518 + 2.346 + 6.342 + 3.128 + 7.036 + 2.346 + 3.91 = 28.626 ≤ 30. Estimated max stress from member forces using equilibrium is ≤ ±6.03 (from history). Thus constraints satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Final design uses historic best structure with node_5 at (6.0,3.0), triangulated closed truss, cross sections assigned to keep max stress ~6.03 and total mass ~28.63. Nodes with load and supports unchanged. Structure is fully connected with no isolated nodes. All constraints met. Ready for output.",
