The objective is to generate a closed 2D truss structure that satisfies both max stress ≤ ±15 and total mass ≤ 30, minimizing stress while maintaining supports and load positions fixed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given load is a -10 unit force at node_3 at -45°, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller), nodes mainly aligned on base (y=0) and top nodes at ~3m height. Current max stress is driven by member_7 (node_3 to node_5) with high tensile stress (-19.79). The mass is acceptable but stress exceeds limits. History shows best feasible design had max stress ~6.03 but higher mass (~28.6). The current design has a lightly loaded base but weak diagonal tension member causing stress violation.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The load at node_3 (-10 at -45°) induces tension in diagonal members from node_3 to top nodes and compression in base members. The current member_7 from node_3 to node_5 is overstressed due to insufficient cross-sectional area (\'1\' = 0.195) and possibly long length (5.8,3.1). The base members and vertical members have moderate stresses. The historical best design uses node_5 at (6.0,3.0) instead of (5.8,3.1), and assigns larger cross sections (area_id \'2\' or \'3\') to diagonal members, reducing stress. The structure is a closed truss with triangulation, which efficiently distributes loads. The current design\'s diagonal member_7 is too slender and too long, causing stress violation. Also, member_4 (node_3-node_2) has small cross section (\'1\') causing minimal support reaction transfer.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: increasing cross section on key diagonals reduces stress; positioning node_5 directly above node_2 (at x=6.0) improves load path symmetry and reduces eccentricity; using triangulation with members node_1-node_4 and node_4-node_5 stabilizes the top chord. Concern: member_7 length and area must be balanced to reduce stress. Insight: use proven historic design with node_5 at (6.0,3.0), assign area_id \'2\' or \'3\' to diagonal members, and keep base members sufficiently strong (area_id \'3\').",\n    \n    "proposal": "Adopt the historic best design with node_5 at (6.0, 3.0), keep node_1 and node_2 fixed at base, node_3 at (2.0, 0.0), node_4 at (2.0, 3.0). Use a closed truss with members connecting node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4, node_5 forming triangulated panels. Assign cross sections to keep max stress ≤ ±15 and total mass ≤ 30, prioritizing larger areas on diagonals and base chords for load distribution.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Symmetry and triangulation ensure stable load paths and reduce bending. Positioning node_5 vertically above node_2 (x=6.0) reduces eccentricity and bending moments. Increasing cross section of critical diagonals (node_3-node_5, node_3-node_2) reduces stress. Base chord members (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2) with moderate area provide stable support. Top chord members (node_4-node_5, node_4-node_1) maintain geometric stability. This approach balances stress and mass effectively.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members are axial force only, linear elastic behavior, load applied at node_3 at -45°. Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance. Member mass = length × area (area from area_id table). Stress proportional to axial force / area. Use area_id \'3\' (1.759) for base chords and top chords, \'2\' (0.782) for diagonals except the critical diagonal node_3-node_5 which uses \'2\' or \'3\' depending on stress. Total mass sum must be ≤30.
