Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Current max stress 6.03 and mass 28.63 meet constraints. Objective: minimize max stress further while keeping mass ≤ 30 and stress ≤ ±15.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given constraints are satisfied. Current design is a closed truss with triangulation around loaded node_3 and nodes_4,5 forming upper chord. Members have varied cross-sectional areas. Load path mainly through members 1,2,3,7. Member_4 has zero stress, indicating possible inefficiency.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-10N at -45°) induces compression in member_2 (-6.03) and tension in member_1 (-5.81). Member_4 is unloaded, suggesting it can be removed or area reduced. Members 3,5,6 carry moderate stress. Member_7 carries notable compression (-5.02). Total mass close to constraint (28.63 < 30). History shows increasing mass reduces stress but inefficient. Node positions fixed for supports and load; node_5 can be slightly adjusted for better load distribution. Current triangulation is good, but member_4 redundancy and member_7 area can be optimized.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_4 zero stress suggests removing or reducing its area to save mass. Member_7 area might be reduced to lower mass without exceeding stress limits. Slight repositioning of node_5 upwards and leftwards may improve force distribution. Member areas can be fine-tuned from available discrete values. Maintain closed loop and connectivity. Avoid increasing mass significantly. Prioritize reducing member_4 area and possibly member_7 area.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Optimize current design by reducing area of member_4 from \'2\' to \'1\' (0.195) or remove if possible, reduce member_7 area from \'2\' to \'1\', keep other areas as is. Slightly reposition node_5 to (5.80, 3.10) to improve triangulation and load path without violating boundary conditions. This should reduce mass and keep stress within limits.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing or reducing member_4 area saves mass without load penalty. Reducing member_7 area reduces mass while stress remains under limit. Moving node_5 upwards and slightly left improves geometry for load transfer from node_3 through node_5 to node_2 and node_4, improving force distribution and reducing peak stress. Triangulation remains intact, maintaining structural stability.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic behavior, stress proportional to force/area, mass proportional to length × area. Calculate member lengths with new node_5 position (5.80, 3.10). Calculate member forces assuming same load and supports. Estimate stress = force / area. Calculate mass = sum(length × area). Check max stress ≤ 15 and total mass ≤ 30. Areas chosen from area_id keys: \'1\' = 0.195, \'2\' = 0.782, \'3\' = 1.759.
