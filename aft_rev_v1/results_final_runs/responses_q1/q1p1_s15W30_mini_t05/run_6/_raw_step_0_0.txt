Objective is to minimize stress within ±15 limit and mass ≤30 using discrete area options, ensuring full connectivity and structural stability.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes: node_1 (0,0, pinned), node_2 (6,0, roller), node_3 (2,0, load -10 at -45°). Only 3 nodes initially colinear, no closed polygon formed. Need to add nodes to form a closed truss. Constraints: max stress ±15, total mass ≤30. Areas from 0 to 10 available. Load at node_3 acts diagonally downward-left, so structure must efficiently transfer load to supports.",\n\n    "analysis": "Initial structure is a line; no closed loop exists so no triangulation or moment resistance. Load at node_3 is diagonal, causing bending if only linear members. To ensure stability and minimize stress, a triangular or polygonal closed truss must be formed. Adding nodes above the baseline to form a triangle or trapezoid will distribute forces better. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) fix vertical and horizontal displacements respectively, allowing reaction forces to resist loads. Failure modes likely tension/compression in members connected to node_3 and newly added nodes. Mass constraint limits large cross sections; need efficient geometry to minimize member lengths and use moderate areas.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "A minimal closed polygon with 4 nodes (adding one node above baseline) can form two triangles sharing node_3. This creates a stable truss with direct load paths. The new node should be near the load node horizontally but elevated vertically to reduce bending and shear. Use triangulation to reduce stress. Member lengths and areas must be balanced to keep stress ≤15 and mass ≤30. Avoid large areas on long members to save mass.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 above node_3 at (2.0, 3.0) to form two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_3, node_4, node_2). This closed shape distributes load from node_3 to supports via node_4. Members: (1-3), (3-4), (4-1), (3-2), (4-2). Triangulation ensures stability. Choose areas: smaller for shorter members, larger for longer members carrying more load. Use trigonometry to estimate member forces under load. Calculate stresses as force/area, mass as sum(length×area). Adjust areas iteratively to meet constraints.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic, static equilibrium, uniform material density. Calculate member lengths: dist between nodes. Calculate reaction forces at supports by resolving load components. Use method of joints to find member forces. Stress = force / area. Mass = Σ(length × area). Areas selected from given set. Target max stress ≤15 and total mass ≤30. Start with moderate areas for main load paths, smaller for less loaded members. Check stress signs for tension/compression.",\n\n    "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1 (0.0, 0.0), node_2 (6.0, 0.0), node_3 (2.0, 0.0), node_4 (2.0, 3.0). Member lengths: (1-3)=2.0, (3-4)=3.0, (4-1)=3.6056, (3-2)=4.0, (4-2)=4.4721. Load at node_3: magnitude 10 N at -45°, components Fx = -7.07 N, Fy = -7.07 N. Reactions at supports: node_1 pinned (Rx1,Ry1), node_2 roller (Ry2). By equilibrium: Rx1 = -7.07 N, Ry1 + Ry2 = 7.07 N, moment equilibrium about node_1 yields Ry2 ≈ 3.54 N, Ry1 ≈ 3.53 N. Using method of joints at node_3 and node_4, solve member forces. Estimated max member force ~10 N. Choose areas to keep stress ≤15: For force ~10 N, area ≥ 10/15=0.6667. Assign area_id \'2\' (0.782) for main load members (3-4), (3-2), (4-2). For shorter members (1-3), (4-1), assign smaller area \'1\' (0.195) to save mass. Calculate mass: sum(length×area): (2×0.195)+(3×0.782)+(3.6056×0.195)+(4×0.782)+(4.4721×0.782)=0.39+2.346+0.703+3.128+3.499=10.066 < 30.
