Objective is to minimize stress under ±15 limit and total mass ≤ 30, using given discrete cross-section areas.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes form a line: node_1 (0,0), node_3 (2,0), node_2 (6,0). Load of -10 units at 45° downward-left on node_3. Supports: pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Need closed truss (cycle), so must add at least one new node to form a triangle. Cross-section areas discrete from 0.195 to 19.548. Stress limit ±15 and mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current nodes lie colinear on x-axis, no closed polygon. Load at node_3 is downward-left, causing bending moment and shear. Supports at ends fix vertical and horizontal reactions. To resist load efficiently, form a triangle by adding a node above the line near node_3 to create two diagonals. This triangulation will provide direct load paths and reduce bending. Members should have sufficient area to keep stress ≤15. Mass is sum of length × area; must select minimal area members to stay ≤30.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding one node above node_3 at (2.0, 2.0) creates a triangle: nodes_1, 2, and new node_4. Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_4. This closed polygon distributes load better. Members connected to loaded node_3 should have larger area to reduce stress. Members forming triangle can be smaller area. Avoid long members with large area to minimize mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Introduce node_4 at (2.0, 2.0) to form a triangle with node_1 and node_2. Connect node_4 to nodes_1, 2, and 3 to create a closed truss with triangulation. Keep node_3 connected to nodes_1, 2, and 4 to transfer load efficiently. Assign larger area to members connected to node_3 to reduce stress from load. Use smaller areas for less stressed members. This configuration balances stress and mass constraints.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic behavior, axial forces only, uniform stress distribution in members. Calculate member lengths by Euclidean distance. Calculate forces by static equilibrium at nodes. Stress = force / area. Mass = sum(length × area). Use area_id from given set. Target max stress ≤15 and mass ≤30. Use trigonometry for member angles and force components.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths (approx): node_1-node_3: 2.0; node_3-node_2: 4.0; node_1-node_4: sqrt((2)^2+(2)^2)=2.828; node_4-node_2: sqrt((4)^2+(2)^2)=4.472; node_3-node_4: 2.0. Assign areas: node_3 connected members area_id \'7\' (9.578) for low stress; others area_id \'1\' (0.195) to save mass. Calculate forces by equilibrium: load at node_3 (-10 at -45°) splits into members. Approximate max force ~10 units, stress = force/area. With area 9.578, stress ~1.04 <15. Mass = sum(length × area): (2×9.578)+(4×9.578)+(2.828×0.195)+(4.472×0.195)+(2×9.578) = 19.156+38.312+0.551+0.872+19.156=78 approx >30. Too heavy. Reduce areas on node_3 connected members to \'4\' (3.128): stress ~3.2 still <15. Mass now: (2×3.128)+(4×3.128)+(2.828×0.195)+(4.472×0.195)+(2×3.128)=6.256+12.512+0.551+0.872+6.256=26.447 <30. Acceptable. Max stress ~3.2 <15. All constraints met.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_final": "Final design: node_4 at (2.0, 2.0) added to form triangle. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4. Areas: node_3 connected members area_id \'4\' (3.128), others area_id \'1\' (0.195).
