The objective is to generate a closed 2D truss satisfying all constraints with minimal stress and mass.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given a downward-left load at node_3, pinned support at node_1 and roller at node_2 on the base. Current structure is complex with 5 nodes and 9 members, mass too high and stress near limit. History shows simpler 4-node truss violates stress constraints (max 34.19).",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current design has high mass due to large areas (mostly 6) and redundant members causing inefficient load paths. Load at node_3 induces high stress in members connecting node_3 to supports. The structure is statically indeterminate with complex triangulation but inefficient. History suggests simpler 4-node truss is lighter but overstressed. Supports at base nodes fix vertical and horizontal reactions, load at node_3 requires strong triangulation to distribute forces. The 5-node design with members connecting node_5 below base adds mass without stress relief. Member areas are oversized causing heavy mass. The load path should be direct from node_3 to supports via triangulated members with optimized areas. Closed truss is required, so all nodes must connect in loops.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing number of nodes to 4 reduces mass but risks stress violation. Increasing area reduces stress but increases mass. Need a balance with minimal nodes, efficient triangulation, and moderate cross-sections. Node_3 is loaded and must remain at (2.0, 0.0). Supports at node_1 (0,0) pinned and node_2 (6,0) roller fixed. Node_4 can be used as apex for triangulation at (3.0, 3.0) to better distribute load. Remove node_5 to reduce complexity and mass. Use moderate areas for members forming triangles. Symmetry and direct load paths will reduce stress and mass.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign with 4 nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (3,3). Connect members to form two triangles: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_2-node_3-node_4, closing the truss. Assign moderate cross-sectional areas to balance mass and stress. Remove node_5 and associated members. This closed triangular truss should better distribute load, reduce mass below 30, and keep max stress under 15.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulated truss with apex node_4 elevated at (3,3) creates stable load path from loaded node_3 to supports. Members node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4 carry tension/compression to supports. Base members node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2 carry shear and compression. Using moderate areas from area_id {2,3,4} balances mass and stress. Pinned and roller supports at base nodes ensure statical determinacy. The structure is closed with 5 members forming two triangles sharing node_3 and node_4. This reduces member length sum and mass, and improves stress distribution compared to 5-node design.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic members, axial forces only.
