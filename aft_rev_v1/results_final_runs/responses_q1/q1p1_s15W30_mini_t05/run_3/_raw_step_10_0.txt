The objective is to generate a closed 2D truss structure that satisfies max stress ±15 and total mass ≤ 30 while minimizing stress and maintaining the given supports and load.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "The load is a -10N force at node_3 at -45°, with node_1 pinned and node_2 roller supports. Current nodes are spread on the base line and elevated points. Constraints require max stress ≤ 15 and total mass ≤ 30. Current design is heavy and overstressed, especially member_6. History shows simpler structures with fewer nodes and members have high stress or mass violations.",\n  "analysis": "The load at node_3 induces significant stress in members connected to it, especially member_6 (node_1-node_3) which is overstressed. The current design has many members with large cross-section areas increasing mass. The structure is a pentagon with internal diagonals, but the load path is not efficiently distributed, causing localized high stress. The supports at node_1 and node_2 fix the base but the mid-span node_3 under load is critical. Previous designs with fewer nodes or less triangulation had stress or mass violations. Notably, the structure needs better triangulation and load transfer from node_3 to supports with moderate member sizes to reduce mass and stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "The key is to maintain a stable triangulated closed truss with nodes positioned for balanced load paths. Node_3 must be supported by well-distributed members to node_1, node_2, and upper nodes. Reducing member areas where possible and repositioning nodes slightly upwards to reduce member lengths and stress is beneficial. The structure should avoid long slender members under tension or compression. Prioritizing a symmetric triangular truss with 4 or 5 nodes, carefully sized members, and minimal redundant members will help meet constraints.",\n  "proposal": "Redesign the truss as a closed 5-node structure with nodes at base (node_1 and node_2), load node_3 fixed at given position, and two upper nodes positioned to form a symmetric trapezoidal shape. Use triangulation connecting node_3 to these upper nodes and supports. Select moderate cross-section areas from available area_id to keep mass ≤ 30 and stress ≤ 15. Keep node_3 fixed as loaded and supports fixed. Adjust upper nodes to optimize load transfer and reduce member lengths.",\n  "reasoning": "A trapezoidal truss with node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) at base, node_3 fixed loaded in between, and two upper nodes forming triangles with node_3 and supports will distribute load efficiently. Triangulation avoids bending and reduces stress concentrations. Moderate member areas reduce mass. Node_3 fixed at (2.00, 0.00) ensures load application point stability. Upper nodes positioned near (1.50, 2.50) and (4.50, 2.50) balance load paths and maintain structural symmetry. Members: base (node_1-node_2), diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_5), verticals (node_4-node_3, node_5-node_3), and top chord (node_4-node_5) form closed truss.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assume linear elastic behavior, axial forces only. Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance. Estimate member forces by static equilibrium at loaded node_3 and supports. Use force balance in x and y directions. Calculate stress = force / area. Total mass = sum(length × area). Choose area_id from {\'1\':0.195, \'2\':0.782, \'3\':1.759, \'4\':3.128} to balance mass and stress. Target max stress ≤ 15 and total mass ≤ 30.

Member lengths: node_1-node_4 ≈ 2.91, node_4-node_3 ≈ 2.50, node_3-node_5 ≈ 2.50, node_5-node_2 ≈ 2.91, node_4-node_5 = 3.00, node_1-node_2 = 6.00. Assign areas: high force members get area_id \'3\' (1.759), moderate force members area_id \'2\' (0.782), low force members area_id \'1\' (0.195). Estimated total mass ≈ 27.5 (below 30).
