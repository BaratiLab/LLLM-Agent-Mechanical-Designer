Objective is to generate a closed 2D truss with max stress ≤ ±15 and total mass ≤ 30, minimizing stress and mass while respecting supports and loads.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given load is a -10N force at node_3 at -45°, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) at base line y=0. Current node layout is asymmetric with node_3 on baseline between supports. Existing members show stress violations mainly in member_2 (node_4-node_5) and high mass mainly from many large area members.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure is a trapezoidal shape with a diagonal bracing through node_3. Load at node_3 induces high stress in member_2 and some diagonals. Mass is excessive due to large cross-sections in multiple members. History shows attempts with fewer nodes and different node locations but all violate stress or mass constraints. The load path is primarily from node_3 diagonally to supports, but the mid-span node_3 on baseline causes stress concentration. The structure is not fully optimized for load distribution and mass. The closed truss must redistribute load more evenly and reduce member sizes.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns show that placing node_3 on baseline causes stress concentration and high mass. Using a symmetric layout with nodes elevated above baseline to form triangles helps distribute load better. Smaller cross-section areas on longer members reduce mass. Triangulation and symmetry are key. Avoid mid-span nodes on baseline under load. The 4-node trapezoid with diagonal bracing and two supports is promising but needs node repositioning and member re-sizing.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Redesign structure with 4 nodes: supports at node_1 and node_2 on baseline, two top nodes elevated symmetrically to form a trapezoidal truss with diagonal bracings forming triangles. Load node_3 fixed at original position on baseline to respect constraints. Members sized with moderate areas to keep mass ≤ 30 and stress ≤ 15. Closed truss with all nodes connected.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Use symmetry about centerline between supports to balance load. Top nodes at y=3.0m for good height to span ratio. Members: bottom chord (node_1-node_2), two verticals (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_5), top chord (node_4-node_5), and two diagonals (node_4-node_3, node_5-node_3). This creates two triangles sharing node_3 at baseline. Load at node_3 shared by diagonals to supports. Cross-sectional areas selected to maintain stress ≤ 15 and reduce mass. Node_3 fixed as load point and baseline node; supports fixed. Node_4 and node_5 repositioned for better triangulation.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic, axial forces only.
