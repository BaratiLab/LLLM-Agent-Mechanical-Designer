The objective is to generate a closed 2D truss with improved load distribution and reduced stress, while keeping total mass ≤30 and max stress ≤±15.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given loads: a 10N force at node_3 downward-left (-45°). Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller on ground. Current nodes form a trapezoidal shape with a lower chord (node_1, node_3, node_2) and upper chord (node_4, node_5). Members connect these nodes with some diagonals. Max stress ~12.21 (close to limit), total mass ~30.2 (close to limit).",\n  \n  "analysis": "The load at node_3 induces compression and tension in members connecting node_3 to supports and upper nodes. Member_3 (node_5-node_2) has very high tensile stress (12.21), likely due to insufficient cross section or load path inefficiency. The structure is nearly a trapezoid with diagonals but the load path is not fully optimized. The upper chord is nearly horizontal, causing bending stresses. The existing design has some long members with small area (area_id \'1\') leading to high stress. The structure is closed but not fully triangulated for optimal load transfer. History shows attempts with different node heights and member configurations, with stress often exceeding 15 or mass exceeding 30. Designs with more triangulation and moderate node height (~2.8 to 3.0) reduce stress but increase mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns show that increasing triangulation and adjusting node heights improves stress but often increases mass beyond 30. The load at node_3 requires strong diagonals to distribute forces to supports. Members with area_id \'1\' or \'0\' are under-sized for high stress members. Node positions at y~3.0 for upper nodes provide good geometry for triangulation. The current design lacks a diagonal member from node_1 to node_5, which can improve load path. Also, member areas need adjustment to reduce stress below 15 while keeping mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Redesign the truss with 5 nodes: keep supports and loaded node fixed. Set upper nodes at y=3.0 for good triangulation. Add diagonal members to fully triangulate the structure: node_1 to node_5, node_4 to node_2, and node_4 to node_3. Use moderate cross-sectional areas, increasing area for members under high stress and reducing for others to keep mass ≤30. This closed, fully triangulated design will better distribute load and reduce max stress below 15.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "A fully triangulated truss with symmetrical geometry ensures better load distribution and stability. The load at node_3 can be transferred via diagonals to both supports. Using node_4 and node_5 at y=3.0 creates a strong top chord. Diagonals from node_1 to node_5 and node_4 to node_2 provide alternate load paths. Member cross sections are selected from area_id set, balancing stress and mass. Members carrying higher forces get larger areas (e.g., area_id \'3\' or \'4\'), others get smaller areas (\'1\' or \'2\'). This approach reduces peak stress and keeps mass within limits.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic behavior, members carry axial forces only, static equilibrium. Calculate member lengths from node coordinates. Mass = sum(length * area). Stress estimated from axial force / area. Axial force from equilibrium equations: sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, sum moments=0. Use trigonometry for member angles. Area selection from given area_id keys. Target max stress ≤15 and total mass ≤30. Node_3 load fixed at (-10N, 45° down-left).

Member lengths calculated. Assign areas: members under high tension/compression get area_id \'3\' (1.759), others \'1\' (0.195) or \'2\' (0.782).
