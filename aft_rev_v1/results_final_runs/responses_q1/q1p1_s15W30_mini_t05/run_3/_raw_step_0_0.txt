Objective is to minimize stress and mass while respecting max stress ±15 and total mass ≤30.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes form a line: node_1(0,0), node_3(2,0), node_2(6,0). Load at node_3 is -10 units at -45°, i.e. down-left diagonal. Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Areas from 0:1 to 10:19.548 available. Need closed truss (closed polygon), so must add at least one new node off the line to form a triangle.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current nodes are colinear, no closed polygon formed. Under diagonal load at node_3, bending moments and shear forces will be significant without triangulation. To minimize stress, a triangular truss is optimal, distributing load efficiently. Adding a node above the line near node_3 creates two triangles sharing node_3, improving load path. Supports at ends provide vertical and horizontal reactions. Failure likely in tension/compression of members connecting node_3 to new node and new node to supports. Mass constraint (≤30) limits large cross-section use.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding one node above the line near node_3 creates a triangle with nodes 1 and 3 and another with nodes 2 and 3, forming a closed polygon. Using larger area for members carrying highest forces (near load) and smaller areas for others balances stress and mass. Member length and area product must keep total mass ≤30. Stress ≤15 limits max force per area. Directional load suggests members from node_3 to new node and supports should be sized accordingly.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Place new node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) above node_3 to form triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4. Triangulation ensures stability and closed polygon. Assign area_id \'4\' (3.128) to members connected to node_3 to handle higher forces, area_id \'1\' (0.195) to longer members to save mass. This configuration should keep mass under 30 and stresses under 15.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Material linear elastic, uniform cross-section per member, stress = force/area. Calculate member lengths by Euclidean distance. Estimate forces by static equilibrium: sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, sum moments=0. Use vector decomposition of load (-10 at -45°) at node_3. Calculate reaction forces at supports. Use truss method (joint equilibrium) to find member forces. Calculate stress = force/(area × unit area factor assumed 1). Calculate mass = sum(length × area). Adjust areas to satisfy constraints.",\n\n    "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1(0.0,0.0), node_2(6.0,0.0), node_3(2.0,0.0), node_4(2.0,3.0).

Calculate mass: (2×3.128)+(4×3.128)+(3.6056×0.195)+(4.4721×0.195)+(3×3.128) = 6.256+12.512+0.703+0.872+9.384=29.727 <30 OK.
