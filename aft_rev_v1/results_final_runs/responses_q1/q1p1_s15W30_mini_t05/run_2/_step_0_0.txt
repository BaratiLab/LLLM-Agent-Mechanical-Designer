  "preamble": "Design a closed 2D truss using three given nodes and one load at node_3, with supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). The goal is to minimize stress under ±15 limit and total mass ≤30, by adding nodes and members as needed for structural triangulation and load path efficiency.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes are collinear along x-axis: node_1(0,0), node_3(2,0), node_2(6,0). Load at node_3 is -10N at -45°, supports at ends. To form a closed truss, need at least one additional node above or below to create triangles. Triangulation will reduce bending and distribute forces. Must choose cross-sectional areas from given discrete values. Initial design will add one node above node_3 to form two triangles: node_1-node_4-node_3 and node_3-node_4-node_2.",
  
  "analysis": "Load at node_3 has horizontal and vertical components (~ -7.07 N horizontal left, -7.07 N vertical down). Pinned at node_1 restrains both directions, roller at node_2 restrains vertical only. The structure must transfer load efficiently to supports. Current collinear nodes are unstable under vertical load. Adding node_4 above node_3 creates two triangles, providing stable load paths. Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_4 form a closed loop. Stress in members depends on geometry and area selection. Mass is sum(length × area).",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation by adding node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) creates two triangles: node_1-node_4-node_3 and node_3-node_4-node_2. This avoids buckling and bending. Member lengths and angles calculated to find forces. Areas selected to keep stress ≤15 and mass ≤30. Members carrying higher loads get larger areas. The diagonal members carry shear and reduce bending. Horizontal members carry axial forces from load transfer.",
  
  "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) to form stable triangular geometry. Connect node_4 to node_1, node_2, and node_3. Keep existing nodes and members between node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2. This produces a closed truss with 5 members. Select areas: smaller for short members, larger for longer or highly stressed members. Check forces by static equilibrium and choose area_id accordingly. This approach balances stress and mass effectively.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic, axial forces only, uniform material density. Calculate member lengths by distance formula. Resolve load at node_3 into components Fx = -7.07N, Fy = -7.07N. Use static equilibrium at nodes to find member forces. Stress = Force / Area. Mass = sum(length × area). Areas chosen from given discrete set. Adjust areas to keep max stress ≤15 and total mass ≤30.",
  
  "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1(0.0,0.0), node_2(6.0,0.0), node_3(2.0,0.0), node_4(2.0,3.0). Members: m1(node_1-node_3), m2(node_3-node_2), m3(node_1-node_4), m4(node_4-node_3), m5(node_4-node_2). Lengths: m1=2.0, m2=4.0, m3=√(2^2+3^2)=3.606, m4=3.0, m5=√(4^2+3^2)=5.0. Assign areas: m1=0.782 (id '2'), m2=0.782 (id '2'), m3=1 (id '0'), m4=0.782 (id '2'), m5=1.759 (id '3'). Calculate forces from equilibrium: approximate max axial force ~10N; stress = force/area ≤ 15 → area ≥ force/15. With chosen areas, max stress ~10/0.782=12.8 <15 OK. Mass = sum(length×area) = (2×0.782)+(4×0.782)+(3.606×1)+(3×0.782)+(5×1.759)=1.564+3.128+3.606+2.346+8.795=19.44 <30 OK.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Design meets constraints: closed triangulated truss with 4 nodes and 5 members, max stress ≤15, mass ≤30. Supports and loads unchanged. Node_4 added for triangulation. Areas selected to balance stress and mass. No duplicate members or nodes. Coordinates precise to 2 decimals. Ready for output.",
