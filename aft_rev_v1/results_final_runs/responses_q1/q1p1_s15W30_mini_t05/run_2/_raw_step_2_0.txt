The goal is to generate a closed 2D truss structure that satisfies both max stress and mass constraints while minimizing stress and maintaining supports and load positions.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Initial structure has 4 nodes with a vertical load at node_3 and supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Max stress is high on member_4 connecting node_4 and node_3. History shows a similar structure with node_4 moved up to 3.0 and slightly different member areas reduced max stress to 13.06 but with mass above 19. The challenge is to reduce max stress below 15 and keep mass below 30 with a closed truss.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-10 N at -45°) induces tension/compression in members connected to node_3. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) provide boundary conditions. Current member_4 (node_4-node_3) is overstressed likely due to insufficient cross-section or poor geometry causing high axial load. The structure is a quadrilateral with diagonals forming triangles but node_4 is low (2.5 m) causing a steep angle and high stress in diagonal members. History shows raising node_4 to 3.0 m and adjusting areas helped but mass increased. To reduce stress, better triangulation and more balanced load paths are needed. The structure must remain closed (fully connected) and nodes with loads/supports fixed in position.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Raising node_4 vertically to about 3.0 m increases leverage and reduces axial forces in diagonals. Using moderate cross-sectional areas (area_id 2 or 3) on diagonals and chords balances mass and stress. The existing member_3 (node_1-node_4) has low area causing high stress; increasing its area reduces stress. Adding a second diagonal (node_1-node_2) can improve triangulation and load distribution. The load direction at -45° requires members arranged to resist combined horizontal and vertical components effectively.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Adopt the historic structure with node_4 moved to (2.0, 3.0) to improve geometry. Add a diagonal member from node_1 to node_2 to form two triangles sharing node_4 and node_3. Assign moderate areas to chords and diagonals to keep mass under 30 while reducing max stress below 15. Keep node_1 and node_2 fixed as supports and node_3 fixed due to load. This closed quadrilateral with two diagonals will distribute load efficiently and satisfy constraints.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangulation principle ensures structural stability and reduces bending. Raising node_4 to 3.0 m increases vertical height, reducing axial forces in diagonals. Adding diagonal member_6 (node_1-node_2) creates two triangles: (node_1-node_3-node_4) and (node_2-node_3-node_4), improving load paths. Assign area_id \'2\' (0.782) to chords and diagonals except one diagonal with area_id \'3\' (1.759) for better stress distribution. This balances cross-sectional area and mass. Supports and load nodes remain fixed to maintain boundary conditions. Estimated mass remains below 30 and max stress below 15 based on proportionality with cross-section and member length.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic axial members, uniform material density, stress proportional to axial force / area.
