The goal is to minimize stress under ±15 limit and total mass ≤30, by adding nodes and members as needed for structural triangulation and load path efficiency.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes are collinear along x-axis: node_1(0,0), node_3(2,0), node_2(6,0). Load at node_3 is -10N at -45°, supports at ends. To form a closed truss, need at least one additional node above or below to create triangles. Triangulation will reduce bending and distribute forces. Must choose cross-sectional areas from given discrete values. Initial design will add one node above node_3 to form two triangles: node_1-node_4-node_3 and node_3-node_4-node_2.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 has horizontal and vertical components (~ -7.07 N horizontal left, -7.07 N vertical down). Pinned at node_1 restrains both directions, roller at node_2 restrains vertical only. The structure must transfer load efficiently to supports. Current collinear nodes are unstable under vertical load. Adding node_4 above node_3 creates two triangles, providing stable load paths. Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_4 form a closed loop. Stress in members depends on geometry and area selection. Mass is sum(length × area).",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation by adding node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) creates two triangles: node_1-node_4-node_3 and node_3-node_4-node_2. This avoids buckling and bending. Member lengths and angles calculated to find forces. Areas selected to keep stress ≤15 and mass ≤30. Members carrying higher loads get larger areas. The diagonal members carry shear and reduce bending. Horizontal members carry axial forces from load transfer.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) to form stable triangular geometry. Connect node_4 to node_1, node_2, and node_3. Keep existing nodes and members between node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2. This produces a closed truss with 5 members. Select areas: smaller for short members, larger for longer or highly stressed members. Check forces by static equilibrium and choose area_id accordingly. This approach balances stress and mass effectively.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic, axial forces only, uniform material density. Calculate member lengths by distance formula. Resolve load at node_3 into components Fx = -7.07N, Fy = -7.07N. Use static equilibrium at nodes to find member forces. Stress = Force / Area. Mass = sum(length × area).
