Current max stress is 11.66 < 15 and mass 22.75 < 30. Objective is to minimize max stress and mass while maintaining constraints and closed geometry.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "The structure is a trapezoidal frame with diagonal bracing. Load at node_3 induces compression in some members and tension in others. Supports fix nodes 1 and 2. Mass and stress constraints are met currently. Member areas range from 1 to 3 (area_id 1 to 3). Current max stress is from member_1 at -11.66, close to limit but not exceeded.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-10N at -45°) creates tension in members connecting to node_3 and compression in others. Member_1 (node_1-node_3) carries highest compressive stress (-11.66). Member_3 and member_5 are larger area (3) indicating higher load. Member_6 (node_1-node_2) is smallest area (1) and likely less stressed. The structure is stable and closed with 4 nodes and 6 members forming triangles. History shows alternative designs with fewer members but higher max stress and lower mass. Current design balances mass and stress well. No constraint violations. Node positions are fixed for supports and load node; node_4 is free and can be adjusted for better load distribution.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 stress is highest and compressive. Increasing its area would reduce stress but increase mass. Alternatively, repositioning node_4 vertically may redistribute forces to reduce member_1 stress. Current node_4 is at (2.0, 3.0). Slightly raising node_4 may better triangulate load paths. Members_3 and 5 have largest areas; can these be optimized? Member_6 is minimal area and low stress, could area be reduced further? The structure is symmetric about vertical line through node_3 and node_4, which is beneficial. History shows removing member_6 or changing connections increases max stress beyond limits.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Maintain current node positions for supports and load. Slightly increase node_4 y-coordinate from 3.00 to 3.20 to improve load path and reduce member_1 stress. Adjust member_1 area from 2 to 3 to reduce max compressive stress. Reduce member_3 area from 3 to 2 to save mass while keeping stress within limits. Keep other areas same. This should reduce max stress and keep mass within 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Raising node_4 vertically increases triangle height, reducing axial forces in member_1 by better load transfer through member_4 and 5. Increasing member_1 area reduces its stress by increasing cross-sectional area. Reducing member_3 area compensates mass increase. Member_6 area kept minimal as it is low stressed. This balances stress and mass optimally. Symmetry and closed geometry preserved.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Stress inversely proportional to area, directly proportional to force.

Recalculate stresses by force/area. Check max stress ≤ ±15 and total mass ≤ 30.
