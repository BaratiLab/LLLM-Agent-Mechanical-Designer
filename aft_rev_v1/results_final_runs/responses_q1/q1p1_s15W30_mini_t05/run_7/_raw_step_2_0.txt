The objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss with given loads and supports, ensuring max stress ≤ 15 and mass ≤ 30, while keeping support and load node positions fixed.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given load at node_3 is -10 N at -45°, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Current nodes form a quadrilateral with diagonal members. Max stress violation mainly on member_3 (node_4 to node_1) at 27.03. Mass is acceptable. History shows attempts with different node heights and member areas but constraints not met.",\n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 induces tension/compression in members connected to node_3 and node_4. Member_3 (node_4 to node_1) is overstressed, likely due to insufficient cross-section or unfavorable geometry. The structure is a quadrilateral with a diagonal, which is good for triangulation but node_4 is at 4.0 height causing long members and high stress. History shows that reducing node_4 height to 3.0 reduced max stress but increased mass. The load direction suggests a force component pulling down-left, so members on left side must resist tension/compression. Current design may have inefficient load paths and uneven stress distribution. The structure is closed but may be improved by better triangulation and node placement.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing height of node_4 reduces member length and stress but increases mass due to larger areas needed. Using a symmetric triangular configuration with node_4 lowered closer to node_3 may improve stress distribution. Using moderate cross-sectional areas on critical members can reduce stress while keeping mass under 30. Member area choices should be optimized to balance stress and mass. Avoid very small or very large areas that cause high stress or mass.",\n  "proposal": "Redesign the truss with node_4 lowered to 3.0 (like best historic design) to reduce stress on member_3. Use a closed quadrilateral with diagonal members forming two triangles for triangulation. Fix node_1 and node_2 as supports, node_3 fixed as load. Use cross-sectional areas from area_id set to keep max stress ≤ 15 and mass ≤ 30. Increase area of critical members (e.g. member_3) moderately, reduce area of less stressed members. Remove member_6 (node_2 to node_3) to reduce complexity and mass, as it was less effective in history. This yields a 5-member closed truss with good triangulation.",\n  "reasoning": "Lowering node_4 reduces member length and bending moment on member_3, reducing stress. Triangulation ensures structural stability and load path efficiency. Fixing node_1 pinned and node_2 roller supports static determinacy. Removing member_6 simplifies load paths and mass. Choosing areas: member_3 needs larger area due to high stress, members connecting node_4 to node_2 and node_1 can have moderate areas, base member_5 (node_2 to node_1) can remain minimal. The load at node_3 is balanced by tension/compression in members to node_1 and node_4. This configuration optimizes stress distribution and mass under constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Member forces calculated by static equilibrium at nodes, ignoring bending and shear. Lengths from node coordinates. Mass = sum(length × area). Stress = force / area. Cross-sectional areas chosen from area_id keys. Calculate member lengths, assign areas, estimate forces by equilibrium at node_3 (load node), check max stress ≤ 15, total mass ≤ 30. Iteratively adjust areas if needed.
