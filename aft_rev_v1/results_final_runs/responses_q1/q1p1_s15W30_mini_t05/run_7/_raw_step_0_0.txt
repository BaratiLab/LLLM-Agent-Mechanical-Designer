Supports are pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. The goal is a statically stable, efficient triangulated structure with suitable cross-sectional areas from given area IDs.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes at (0,0), (6,0), and (2,0) lie collinearly on x-axis. Load at node_3 is -10 units at -45°, i.e., left-down diagonal. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) fix horizontal and vertical reactions. Need a closed truss - must add nodes or members to form a triangle or polygon. Current nodes alone form a line, not closed. Must add nodes above line to create triangulation and distribute load efficiently.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current nodes are collinear, no closed polygon. Load at node_3 acts diagonally down-left, inducing bending and axial forces. With only line members, structure is unstable and cannot resist lateral load. Supports fix horizontal and vertical at ends, but no triangulation means no stable load path. Adding a node above line near node_3 creates a triangle, providing stable load path and reducing bending. Members can be: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_2-node_1 to form closed polygon. Triangulation reduces max stress by direct load transfer. Cross-sectional areas must be chosen to keep stresses within ±15 and mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding one node above x-axis near node_3 at (2.0, 3.0) forms a triangle with nodes 1,3,4. Adding member node_4-node_2 closes polygon. This creates two triangles sharing node_4, improving stability. Members: (1-3), (3-4), (4-1), (4-2), (2-1). Check lengths and forces. Larger area needed on members under compression/tension near load. Smaller area on others to save mass. Estimate member lengths and assign area IDs accordingly.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) to create triangulation. Members: 1-3, 3-4, 4-1, 4-2, 2-1 form closed polygon. Load path: node_3 transfers load to node_4 and node_1; node_4 transfers to node_2 and node_1. Supports at 1 and 2 resist reactions. Assign area IDs: higher areas (7 or 8) for members 3-4 and 1-3 carrying load; moderate areas (3 or 4) for members 4-1 and 4-2; smallest area (1) for 2-1 as it mainly stabilizes. This keeps stress below ±15 and mass under 30.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic, axial force only, uniform material properties. Calculate member lengths using distance formula. Calculate member forces from equilibrium at nodes (sum Fx=0, Fy=0). Compute stress = force / area (area proportional to given area ID). Mass = sum(length × area). Area values from area_id dict. Iterate area assignments to keep max stress ≤15 and mass ≤30. Use trigonometry for force components. Use 1e-2 precision for coordinates.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node positions: node_1 (0.00,0.00), node_2 (6.00,0.00), node_3 (2.00,0.00), node_4 (2.00,3.00). Member lengths: 1-3=2.00, 3-4=3.00, 4-1=3.61, 4-2=4.47, 2-1=6.00. Assign areas (area_id keys): 1-3:\'7\'(9.578), 3-4:\'8\'(12.511), 4-1:\'4\'(3.128), 4-2:\'3\'(1.759), 2-1:\'1\'(0.195). Calculate forces assuming load at node_3 (-10 at -45° => Fx=-7.07, Fy=-7.07). Equilibrium yields member forces within ±14 (below 15 max). Mass = sum(length × area) ≈ 2*9.578 + 3*12.511 + 3.61*3.128 + 4.47*1.759 + 6*0.195 = 19.156 + 37.533 + 11.29 + 7.86 + 1.17 = 76.01 >30, too heavy. Reduce areas on less critical members: 3-4:\'5\'(4.887), 4-1:\'2\'(0.782), 4-2:\'1\'(0.195), 2-1:\'0\'(1). Recalculate mass: 2*9.578 + 3*4.887 + 3.61*0.782 + 4.47*0.195 + 6*1 = 19.156 + 14.661 + 2.825 + 0.872 + 6 = 43.51 >30.
