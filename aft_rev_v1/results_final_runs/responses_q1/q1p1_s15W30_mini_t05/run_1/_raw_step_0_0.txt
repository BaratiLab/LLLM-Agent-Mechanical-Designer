Objective is to minimize stress within ±15 and total mass ≤30, using given discrete cross-sectional areas, ensuring full connectivity and structural stability.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Load of -10 units at 45° down-left on node_3. Supports: pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Constraints: max stress ±15, mass ≤30. Current nodes lie on x-axis, so no vertical triangulation exists. A closed truss requires at least a triangle. Need to add nodes to form a stable triangular shape and distribute load effectively.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current nodes form a straight line, which is unstable under lateral loads. The load at node_3 acts diagonally downward left, inducing bending and shear if unsupported. Supports at ends provide vertical and horizontal reactions but no triangulation means no stable load path. To minimize stress, a triangular configuration is necessary, preferably with a node above the line to triangulate and transfer load efficiently. Members should be chosen to balance tension and compression. Cross-sectional areas must be chosen to keep stress within ±15 and mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a node above the line near node_3 will create two triangles: node_1-node_3-new_node and node_2-node_3-new_node, forming a closed truss. This will distribute load through axial forces. The vertical height of the new node should be optimized to reduce member forces and mass. Member areas must be chosen carefully to keep stress low but mass under limit. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-new_node, node_2-new_node, node_3-new_node to close the loop.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Add a new node (node_4) at (2.0, 3.0) above node_3 to form a triangle. This creates a stable truss with members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4. This triangulation efficiently transfers the diagonal load into axial forces. Use moderate cross-sectional areas from area_id to keep stress ≤15 and mass ≤30. Larger areas for members with higher force, smaller for others. This configuration avoids bending, maximizes axial load paths, and keeps mass low.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Material is linear elastic; stress = force/area; force calculated from static equilibrium. Equilibrium equations at nodes for vertical and horizontal forces. Calculate member lengths using distance formula. Estimate member forces by method of joints or sections.
