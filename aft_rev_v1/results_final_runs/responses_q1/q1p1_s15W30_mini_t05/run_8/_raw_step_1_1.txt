Objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss satisfying max stress ±15 and total mass ≤ 30 with given supports and load.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given load at node_3 (-10N at 45° down-left), pinned support at node_1, roller at node_2. Current structure has a trapezoidal shape with diagonal members but member_1 is overstressed. Mass is below limit but stress violation is critical.",\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 induces tension/compression in members connected there. Member_1 is highly compressed (-15.07), likely due to long unsupported span and load direction. The current structure is not symmetric and lacks sufficient triangulation around loaded node_3. The support conditions fix node_1 fully and node_2 horizontally only, so vertical load transfer must be via node_3 and node_4. The current members do not optimally distribute forces, causing overstress. The structure is closed but inefficient. Historic structure shows similar pattern with overstress on member_1. Mass is acceptable but stress constraint violated.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Need to improve triangulation around node_3 and node_4 to distribute loads better. Possibly add an additional node or reposition node_4 for better geometry. Increase cross-sectional areas of critical members or shorten long members. Symmetry about the horizontal axis can help balance forces. Use of diagonal members in both directions to form stable triangles is essential.",\n    "proposal": "Redesign closed truss with 4 nodes: keep node_1 and node_2 fixed at supports, keep node_3 fixed at load position, reposition node_4 higher to create better triangulation. Add one more node (node_5) above node_3 to form a triangular truss with better load path. Connect members to form closed loops with diagonal bracing. Assign cross-sectional areas to reduce stress below ±15 while keeping total mass ≤ 30.",\n    "reasoning": "By adding node_5 above node_3, we create two triangles sharing node_3, improving load transfer. Node_4 is raised to 3.0m height to increase vertical support and reduce member length stress. Members arranged as: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_3-node_5, node_4-node_5. This creates multiple load paths and triangulation. Using areas from area_id with moderate sizes (2,3,4) balances mass and strength. Supports and load nodes remain fixed to satisfy constraints. Assumed uniform material and linear stress distribution. Member lengths calculated by Euclidean distance, mass by length × area. Stress estimated by load distribution and member force equilibrium.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Load at node_3 decomposed into Fx = -10*cos(45°) = -7.07N, Fy = -10*sin(45°) = -7.07N. Support at node_1 pinned (both directions fixed), node_2 roller (vertical free, horizontal fixed). Force equilibrium equations at nodes to solve member forces. Member forces = axial force = stress × area. Stress limit ±15. Mass = Σ(length × area). Choose areas to keep max stress within limits.
