The objective is to generate a closed 2D truss structure that satisfies max stress ±15 and mass ≤30 while maintaining given supports and loads.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "The load is a downward-left force (-10, -45°) at node_3 on a truss with 5 nodes and 7 members. Supports are pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current max stress is 34.19 (exceeds limit), total mass 21.65 (within limit). History shows a simpler 4-node structure with lower max stress (15.07) but higher mass (26.88).",\n  \n  "analysis": "The current structure has a node_5 at (2.0,4.0) that adds complexity and some zero-stress members, indicating inefficient load paths. The high stress (34.19) occurs at member_3 (node_1 to node_4), suggesting poor load transfer in upper members. The structure is not optimally triangulated for the applied load direction. The historic 4-node structure is simpler, fully triangulated and has max stress near the limit but higher mass. The load at node_3 (between supports) induces bending, so a stable triangular or diamond shape with good load paths is needed. Supports at nodes 1 and 2 fix horizontal and vertical reactions, so the truss must efficiently transfer load from node_3 to these supports. The current design\'s extra node_5 and members may cause stress concentrations and inefficient force distribution.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "A simpler, fully triangulated closed structure with four nodes forming a diamond or trapezoid shape could reduce max stress while keeping mass under 30. Node positions should maintain supports and load node fixed. Using history, the 4-node design with nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), (2,2) is promising but node_4 height can be adjusted to balance stresses. Member cross sections should be chosen to keep stresses within ±15 and mass minimal.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Adopt a 4-node closed truss with nodes: node_1 (0.00, 0.00), node_2 (6.00, 0.00), node_3 (2.00, 0.00, load applied), node_4 (2.50, 2.50) to improve triangulation and load transfer. Members connect: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4 forming a diamond shape. Choose moderate cross-sectional areas to keep stresses ≤15 and mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "A diamond shape with node_4 elevated to 2.5m provides better load path from node_3 load to supports, reducing bending moments. Triangulation ensures stability and efficient force distribution. Node_3 remains at (2,0) to keep load and support layout intact. Members are sized from area_id to balance stress and mass. Using areas 2 (0.782) and 3 (1.759) for vertical and diagonal members respectively balances load capacity and weight.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members behave as axial force elements (tension/compression). Load at node_3 is -10N at -45°. Supports fix reactions at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Calculate member lengths via distance formula, then estimate axial forces by static equilibrium (sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, sum moments=0). Stress = Force / (Area * cross-section factor); mass = sum(length * area). Iterate area selection to keep max stress ≤15 and mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2.5,2.5).

Calculate approximate forces by equilibrium: load at node_3 splits between members 1, 2, and 5. Estimated max force ~12N, stress = force/(area) ≤ 15, satisfied. Total mass = sum(length*area) = 2*0.782 + 4*0.782 + 3.54*1.759 + 3.54*1.759 + 2.5*1.759 ≈ 1.564 + 3.128 + 6.22 + 6.22 + 4.4 = 21.55 < 30.
