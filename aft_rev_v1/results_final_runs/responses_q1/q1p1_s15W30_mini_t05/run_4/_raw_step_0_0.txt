Objective is to minimize stress within ±15 units and keep total mass ≤30 using discrete area choices, ensuring all nodes form a closed structure.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes form a triangle base (0,0), (6,0), and (2,0) with load at node_3 downward-left at 45°. Supports fix node_1 fully and node_2 vertically. Need a closed truss, so we must add at least one node above to form a triangle or polygon. Stress and mass constraints are tight, so member sizing and geometry are critical.",\n  \n  "analysis": "With only nodes on x-axis, the structure is a line, not closed. To close, add node_4 above node_3 to form triangle. Load at node_3 is diagonal downward-left, inducing tension in some members and compression in others. Pinned and roller supports provide vertical and horizontal restraint. Triangulation is essential to distribute load efficiently. Failure likely from excessive stress in diagonal members or too large area increasing mass beyond limit. Using minimal area members on compression members and larger on tension members can optimize stress and mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "A triangle formed by node_1, node_2, and new node_4 above node_3 will create closed polygon. Diagonal members from node_3 to node_1 and node_3 to node_4 will carry load. Member from node_4 to node_2 closes polygon. Choosing area sizes from given discrete values to keep mass under 30 while controlling stress is key. Load path: node_3 load transfers through diagonal members to supports.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 4.0) above node_3 to form a triangle with base nodes. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_2 (base), node_3-node_2 (closing polygon). Triangulation ensures stability and load distribution. Assign larger area to member carrying highest tension/compression, smaller areas to less stressed members. This balances stress and mass. Use area_id \'5\' (4.887) for main diagonals and \'1\' (0.195) for base members to reduce mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic behavior, axial forces only, uniform cross-section per member. Equilibrium equations at nodes for force balance in x and y. Calculate member lengths using distance formula. Calculate member forces by method of joints or sections. Stress = force/area. Mass = sum(length × area). Check max stress ≤15 and mass ≤30. Adjust area_ids accordingly. Node_4 chosen at 4.0 height to keep member lengths reasonable and stiffness adequate.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2,4).

Assign areas: node_1-node_3: 4.887, node_3-node_4:4.887, node_4-node_2:4.887, node_1-node_2:0.195, node_3-node_2:0.195. Total mass = 6*0.195 + 2*4.887 + 4*4.887 + 5.657*4.887 + 4*0.195 ≈ 1.17 + 9.774 + 19.548 + 27.66 + 0.78 = 58.93 > 30 too high. Reduce areas for base members and node_3-node_4 to \'2\'(0.782) and keep diagonals at \'3\'(1.759) to reduce mass: recalc mass = 6*0.195 + 2*1.759 + 4*0.782 + 5.657*1.759 + 4*0.195 = 1.17 + 3.518 + 3.128 + 9.95 + 0.78 = 18.55 < 30 good.
