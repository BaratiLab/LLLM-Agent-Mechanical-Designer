Objective is to create a closed, triangulated truss minimizing stress under ±15 limit and mass ≤ 30, using given discrete cross-section areas.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes form a line: node_1(0,0), node_3(2,0), node_2(6,0). Load at node_3 is -10N at -45°, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Current nodes alone cannot form a closed structure; need additional node(s) to form a closed polygon (triangle or quadrilateral).",\n\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 acts down-left, inducing tension/compression in members connected to it. Supports at node_1 and node_2 fix horizontal and vertical displacements respectively. Without vertical or diagonal members, structure is unstable and open. A triangulated structure with a new node above the baseline will efficiently transfer load through tension and compression, minimizing stress. Member lengths and areas must be chosen to keep stress ≤15 and mass ≤30. The mass is sum of (length × area).",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "A single additional node above the baseline, forming a triangle with node_1 and node_2, will create a closed truss. Connect node_3 to this new node to triangulate the load path. Use larger area members on longer members and smaller areas on shorter members to optimize mass. The new node should be placed to balance geometry and force distribution, likely near midpoint horizontally and elevated vertically.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Place new node_4 at (3.0, 3.0) to form an equilateral-like triangle with base nodes. Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_3-node_2. This creates multiple triangles and closed loops ensuring stability. Choose area_id \'4\' (3.128) for longer members to reduce stress, and smaller areas for shorter members. This layout distributes load efficiently, reduces max stress, and keeps mass within limit.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic behavior, uniform stress distribution in members, load applied only at node_3, pin and roller supports ideal. Calculate member lengths using distance formula. Estimate forces using static equilibrium (sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, sum moments=0). Stress = Force / Area. Mass = sum(length × area). Use area_id values scaled as given. Adjust areas to keep max stress ≤15 and total mass ≤30.",\n\n    "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1(0.00,0.00), node_2(6.00,0.00), node_3(2.00,0.00), node_4(3.00,3.00). Member lengths (approx.): n1-n4=3.61, n4-n2=3.61, n1-n3=2.00, n3-n4=3.16, n3-n2=4.00. Assign areas: n1-n4=3.128, n4-n2=3.128, n1-n3=1.759, n3-n4=1.759, n3-n2=0.782. Total mass ≈ (3.61*3.128)*2 + 2*1.759 + 4*0.782 = 22.6 + 3.52 + 3.13 = 29.25 < 30. Estimated max stress ≤15 based on force distribution and areas.
