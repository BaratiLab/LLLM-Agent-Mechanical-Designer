The objective is to generate a closed 2D truss with reduced total mass ≤ 30 and max stress ≤ ±15, maintaining supports and load nodes fixed, and improving load path and member sizing for efficiency.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Initial structure has nodes along the base (node_1, node_2, node_3) and one top node (node_4). Load at node_3 downward-left at 45°. Supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller. Members form a partial triangular shape but mass is high due to large cross sections and member lengths. Max stress is moderate but mass is excessive. Need to reduce mass by optimizing geometry and areas.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-10N at -45°) induces tension/compression in members connected to node_3 and node_4. Current members with large area (4) on node_1-node_4 and node_4-node_2 are heavy. Node_3 at base is loaded and connected to node_1, node_2, and node_4, forming a non-ideal load path with large member lengths and oversized areas. The structure is not fully triangulated; node_3 lies on the base line which reduces rigidity and increases bending effects. The structure is not closed in a fully triangulated sense; node_3 is colinear with node_1 and node_2, reducing stiffness and increasing mass. Historic structure confirms constraint violation due to excessive mass. The max stress is well below limits, so member areas can be reduced while maintaining strength.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Insight: To reduce mass, reconfigure nodes so that load node_3 is elevated above base line to form a more efficient triangular truss. This improves load transfer and allows smaller cross-sectional areas. Use a 4-node trapezoidal or triangular shape with all members triangulated, avoiding colinear nodes. Also, reduce member areas by selecting smaller area_id values consistent with stress limits. Keep node_1 and node_2 fixed at base with supports. Keep node_3 fixed in x,y since it carries load, but can move vertically if allowed. However, instruction says do not move nodes with loads or supports, so node_3 position fixed at (2.0, 0.0). We can add a new node above node_3 to create a closed triangulated truss and redistribute load paths.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Add a new top node (node_5) above node_3 at (2.0, 2.5) to form two triangles: node_1-node_5-node_3 and node_3-node_5-node_2. Connect node_5 to node_1, node_2, and node_3, forming a closed truss with 6 members. This improves triangulation and load paths. Reduce member cross sections to smaller area_id values to reduce mass while keeping max stress ≤ 15. Keep existing supports and load nodes fixed, add node_5 for structural efficiency.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Adding node_5 above node_3 creates two triangles sharing node_5 at apex, improving load distribution and stiffness. Triangulation prevents bending and distributes load efficiently. Members from node_5 to supports and load nodes shorten load paths and reduce stress concentrations. Smaller cross sections can be chosen because load paths are more direct, reducing member forces. This design aligns with basic truss principles: triangulation, direct load paths, and minimal mass. Node_5 positioned at (2.0, 2.5) balances vertical height for stiffness and minimal member length.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: 1) Material density and member length × area proportional to mass. 2) Max member stress proportional to axial force / area. 3) Load is static and only at node_3. 4) Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) fixed. Calculations: Compute member lengths, select areas from area_id to keep max stress ≤ 15 and sum mass ≤ 30. Use trigonometry to find lengths: e.g., node_1-node_5: sqrt((2-0)^2 + (2.5-0)^2) = sqrt(4+6.25)=2.69m approx. Member forces estimated by static equilibrium of nodes. Areas chosen to keep stress within limits. Members: (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), (node_1-node_5), (node_5-node_2), (node_3-node_5), and add (node_1-node_2) base chord for closure and stiffness.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths (approx): node_1-node_3: 2m, node_3-node_2: 4m, node_1-node_5: 2.69m, node_5-node_2: 4.47m, node_3-node_5: 2.5m, node_1-node_2: 6m.
