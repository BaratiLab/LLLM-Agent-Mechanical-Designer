Objective is to design a closed 2D truss satisfying max stress ±15 and mass ≤30, minimizing stress and maintaining support/load conditions.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given a single downward-left load at node_3, pinned support at node_1, roller at node_2. Current structure has a top node (node_5) slightly offset at (2.1, 2.6) causing high stress in member_5. History shows better designs with node_5 at (2.0, 2.5) and different member areas. Constraints: max stress ≤ ±15, mass ≤ 30.",\n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-10N at -45°) induces tension and compression in members connecting node_3 to supports and top node. Current high stress in member_5 (-36.29) suggests poor load path or insufficient area. History best design uses node_5 at (2.0, 2.5) with more balanced member areas, reducing max stress to ~11.37 and mass ~16.27. Triangulation with nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), and (2,2.5) forms a stable, closed truss. Members connecting node_3 to node_5 and node_5 to node_2 carry load efficiently with larger areas. Current design\'s slight node_5 displacement and smaller areas cause stress concentration and mass increase.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Pattern: node_5 at (2.0, 2.5) yields better stress distribution. Member areas should be chosen to balance load paths: larger areas on members under higher stress, smaller where stress is low. Avoid member_5 area too small to reduce stress concentration. Maintaining symmetry and triangulation improves stability and load transfer. Load direction and supports fixed, so node positions (except free nodes) should not change except node_5 to optimize.",\n  "proposal": "Adopt historic best structure with node_5 at (2.0, 2.5). Use member areas from best design: member_1 (node_1-node_3) area_id \'2\', member_2 (node_3-node_2) \'1\', member_3 (node_1-node_5) \'2\', member_4 (node_5-node_2) \'3\', member_5 (node_3-node_5) \'2\', member_6 (node_1-node_2) \'1\'. This design is closed, stable, and meets constraints with improved stress and mass.",\n  "reasoning": "Triangular geometry with node_5 elevated distributes load from node_3 to supports effectively. Larger area on member_4 (node_5-node_2) supports compression/tension transfer to roller support. Moderate areas on diagonals (member_1, member_3, member_5) balance forces. Smallest area on direct base member (member_6) reduces mass without compromising support. Symmetry and triangulation ensure no isolated nodes and good load paths. Node_5 repositioned to (2.0, 2.5) optimizes geometry, reduces stress concentration.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic behavior, uniform material. Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance. Member mass = length × area. Stress estimated by dividing axial force by area. Axial forces found by static equilibrium at nodes considering load and reactions. Use areas from area_id dict. Verify max stress ≤ ±15 and total mass ≤ 30. Iterative check confirms historic best design satisfies constraints.",\n  "calculation": "Node distances: node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_2 = 4.0, node_1-node_5 = sqrt((2-0)^2 + (2.5-0)^2) = 3.2016, node_5-node_2 = sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-2.5)^2) = 4.71699, node_3-node_5 = sqrt((2-2)^2 + (2.5-0)^2) = 2.5, node_1-node_2 = 6.0.
