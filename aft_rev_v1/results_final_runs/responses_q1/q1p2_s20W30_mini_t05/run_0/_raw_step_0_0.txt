Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Objective: minimize stress ≤ ±20 and mass ≤30 with given discrete cross-sectional areas.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given 3 colinear nodes on x-axis, load applied at node_3 diagonally down-left. Supports at ends. Need a closed truss (triangle minimum). Current nodes form a line, no closed shape. Must add nodes off-axis to form closed polygon. Constraints on stress and mass require careful member sizing and triangulation.",\n\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 acts downward-left (-10N, -45°). With node_3 at (2,0), supports at ends, load will cause bending and tension/compression in members. A triangle is minimal closed structure. Adding a node above x-axis near node_3 allows triangulation. Members must be sized to keep stress ≤20 and total mass ≤30. Compressive and tensile stresses must be balanced. Using discrete area sizes from 0.195 to 19.548, smaller areas reduce mass but risk higher stress.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "To keep stress low, members carrying large forces should have larger cross-section. Triangulation to distribute forces is key. Adding one node above node_3 at about (2,3) creates a triangle with base (node_1 to node_2) and two inclined members. This distributes load efficiently. Members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_4 to close the polygon. Check mass and stress with these members.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) to form a triangle with node_1 and node_2. Members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3. This creates multiple load paths, reduces stress in any single member. Use larger area (area_id \'3\' = 1.759) for members under higher load, smaller areas for others. This balances mass and stress. Node_3 remains at (2.0,0.0) to maintain load position and supports unchanged.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic, axial forces only. Calculate member lengths using distance formula. Calculate forces by static equilibrium (sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, moment=0). Calculate stress = force/area, with area from area_id. Mass = sum(length × area). Use trigonometry to find member angles and force components. Choose areas to keep max stress ≤20 and mass ≤30.",\n\n    "calculation": "Member lengths (approx): node_1-node_4: 3.605, node_2-node_4: 4.472, node_3-node_4: 3.0, node_1-node_3: 2.0, node_2-node_3: 4.0. Estimated forces from equilibrium give max force ~30N in longest members. Using area 1.759 (area_id \'3\') for node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4 keeps stress ~17 < 20. Smaller area 0.782 (area_id \'2\') for node_3-node_4 and node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3 keeps stress under limit. Total mass ≈ (3.605+4.472)*1.759 + (3.0+2.0+4.0)*0.782 = 14.4 + 7.1 = 21.5 < 30.
