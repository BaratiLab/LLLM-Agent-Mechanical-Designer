  "preamble": "The current truss structure at iteration 11/25 shows max stress 6.23 and mass 34.52, violating the mass constraint (max 30). The objective is to generate a closed 2D truss satisfying max stress ≤ ±20 and mass ≤ 30, minimizing stress and mass while respecting supports and loads.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given load at node_3 (-10N at -45°), supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current nodes form a shallow trapezoid with midspan node_3 on bottom chord. Members form a closed polygon with diagonals. Area selections range from 2 to 4, resulting in high mass (34.5) and stress near limit.",
  "analysis": "Load at node_3 applies downward-left force, inducing tension and compression in members connected to node_3. Current design uses relatively large cross sections (area_id 4 for bottom chord members) leading to high mass. History shows smaller area members reduce mass but increase stress beyond limits. Triangulation is good but node_3 on bottom chord limits efficient load transfer. Structures with higher top chord height (around y=3.0) show better stress distribution but sometimes higher mass. Adding a mid-height node to improve load path was tried but led to stress violations. The current mass exceeds limit, so either reducing member areas or reconfiguring geometry is needed. Stress limits are currently met.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce mass below 30 while keeping max stress ≤ 20, we need to optimize geometry to reduce member lengths and use smaller cross sections where possible. Increasing top chord height slightly to about 3.0m improves triangulation and load transfer. Using area_id 3 (1.759) for bottom chords and 2 (0.782) for diagonals reduces mass. Avoid very small cross sections on bottom chords to keep stress low. Node_3 should remain at (2.0,0.0) due to load and support constraints. Maintain closed polygon with triangulation. Avoid isolated nodes.",
  "proposal": "Redesign the truss with nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (1.5,3.0), node_5 (4.5,3.0). Use members forming a trapezoidal closed truss with diagonal bracing between node_4-node_3 and node_5-node_3, and top chord node_4-node_5. Assign moderate areas: bottom chords area_id '3' (1.759), diagonals area_id '2' (0.782), top chord area_id '3' (1.759). This matches the best historic structure with total mass ~26.5 and max stress ~6.7, satisfying constraints.",
  "reasoning": "This configuration uses symmetry and triangulation for efficient load distribution. The top chord at 3.0m height provides good vertical stiffness. Using moderate cross sections balances stress and mass. The pinned and roller supports at nodes 1 and 2 provide stable boundary conditions. The load at node_3 is well supported by diagonals transferring forces to supports. This design is proven feasible in history with constraints met.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: uniform material density; member mass = length × area_id value; stress proportional to force/area; forces calculated from static equilibrium of nodes. Calculate member lengths with Euclidean distance. Calculate mass sum. Check max stress from history as reference. Use area_id values only from given set. Node_3 fixed at (2.0,0.0) due to load. Node_1 and node_2 fixed at (0,0) and (6,0). Node_4 and node_5 placed at (1.5,3.0) and (4.5,3.0) to optimize triangulation and load path.",
  "calculation": "Member lengths (approx):\n- node_1-node_3: 2.0m\n- node_3-node_2: 4.0m\n- node_1-node_4: sqrt((1.5)^2 + (3)^2) ≈ 3.35m\n- node_4-node_3: sqrt((0.5)^2 + (3)^2) ≈ 3.04m\n- node_3-node_5: sqrt((2.5)^2 + (3)^2) ≈ 3.91m\n- node_5-node_2: sqrt((1.5)^2 + (3)^2) ≈ 3.35m\n- node_4-node_5: 3.0m\n\nMass calculation:\n- Bottom chords (members 1 & 2): length × area_id 3 (1.759): (2 + 4) × 1.759 = 6 × 1.759 = 10.554\n- Diagonals (members 4 & 5): (3.04 + 3.91) × 0.782 ≈ 6.95 × 0.782 = 5.44\n- Top chord (member 7): 3.0 × 1.759 = 5.277\n- Vertical chords (members 3 & 6): (3.35 + 3.35) × 0.782 = 6.7 × 0.782 = 5.24\n\nTotal mass ≈ 10.554 + 5.44 + 5.277 + 5.24 = 26.51 ≤ 30 constraint met.\n\nMax stress from history ~6.7 < 20 constraint met.\n\nStructure is fully connected and closed polygon.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "The proposed structure satisfies all constraints: max stress ≤ 20 and total mass ≤ 30. Node positions respect load and support constraints. Member areas are chosen to balance mass and stress. Geometry ensures triangulation and load transfer. Structure is closed and stable. Ready for output.",
