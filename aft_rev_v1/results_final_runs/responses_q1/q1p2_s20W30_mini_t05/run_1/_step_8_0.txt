    "preamble": "The current truss design at iteration 7/25 violates the max stress constraint (±20) with max stress = 12.06 and total mass = 43.5 exceeding the mass limit of 30. The objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss structure that satisfies both max stress and total mass constraints while maintaining supports and load nodes fixed.",

    "scratch_pad_1": "The structure has 5 nodes with load applied at node_3 and supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Current members form a partial triangulation but mass is high and stress exceeds limits. History shows attempts with added nodes and members but often mass or stress constraints are violated. The best previous design had max stress ~9 with mass ~46, still above mass limit.",

    "analysis": "The load at node_3 (-10N at -45°) induces tension/compression in members connected to node_3. Supports at node_1 and node_2 provide reaction forces. Current structure has longer members with large cross-sectional areas increasing mass. Members connecting node_3 to nodes 4 and 5 carry significant loads but mass is high. Lack of full triangulation or redundant load paths leads to high stress concentration in some members. History shows that adding node_6 in the middle and connecting it to nodes 3,4,5 reduces stress but mass remains high. Also, some previous designs had very high stresses (up to 52), indicating poor load distribution. Efficient load transfer requires a symmetric, triangulated design with shorter members and optimized cross sections to reduce mass and stress.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Symmetry and triangulation improve load distribution and reduce peak stresses. The load at node_3 is central and downward-left; an efficient design should transfer load to supports via multiple paths. The current node positions 1 and 2 fixed at bottom corners, nodes 4 and 5 at top corners, node_3 is mid bottom. Adding a central node above node_3 can create two symmetric triangles on either side, improving load paths and reducing stress. Using smaller cross sections on less stressed members and larger on critical members can reduce mass. Avoiding long slender members reduces stress. The design must be closed (fully connected) and all nodes must be connected.",

    "proposal": "Redesign the truss with 6 nodes: keep node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0) fixed per constraints. Add node_4 at (0,3), node_5 at (6,3) (top corners), and node_6 at (3,1.5) centrally above node_3 to form two symmetric triangles. Connect members to form closed triangulated structure: bottom chord (node_1-node_3-node_2), top chord (node_4-node_6-node_5), diagonals connecting bottom and top nodes, and verticals from node_3 to node_6. Use area_id cross sections optimized for stress and mass balance. This design improves load distribution, reduces member length, and respects constraints.",

    "reasoning": "Triangulation ensures structural stability and distributes load efficiently. Symmetry reduces bending and stress peaks. The central node_6 allows load at node_3 to transfer upward and outward to supports. Members connecting node_6 to nodes 4 and 5 form upper chord, while diagonals connect bottom and top chords. Cross sectional areas are chosen to keep stress within ±20 and minimize mass below 30. Node_3 is fixed to avoid moving loaded node. Supports at node_1 and node_2 are fixed. This design balances load paths and mass.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic behavior, uniform material density, stress proportional to axial force / area. Calculate member lengths by Euclidean distance. Estimate forces by static equilibrium: sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, sum moments=0. Use truss method to find member axial forces. Calculate stress = force / area. Mass = sum(member length × area). Iterate area selection to meet max stress ≤ ±20 and total mass ≤ 30. Cross sections from area_id dictionary. Node positions fixed for loaded and supported nodes; added node_6 at (3.0,1.5) to improve triangulation.",
