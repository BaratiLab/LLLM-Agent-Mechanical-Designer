The objective is to generate a closed 2D truss structure that satisfies both stress and mass constraints while maintaining supports and load positions fixed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The problem involves a 6-node truss with supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). A load of 10 units at -45° is applied at node_3. Constraints are max stress ±20 and total mass ≤ 30. Current designs show stress concentrations in members connected to node_4 and node_5, with some members under high stress and mass exceeding limits.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The load at node_3 creates tension and compression primarily in members connected to node_3, node_4, and node_5. Members like member_5 (node_1-node_4) are highly stressed. The structure is not fully triangulated causing inefficient load paths and high stress in some members. History shows simpler 4-node trusses with fewer members have lower mass but higher stress, while more complex 7-node trusses have lower stress but exceed mass limits. The current 7-node design is over mass and stress limits. The pinned and roller supports at nodes 1 and 2 provide proper boundary conditions, but the mid-span nodes (6 and 7) add complexity without sufficient stress relief. The top chord (nodes 4 and 5) is loaded but not optimally triangulated.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Closed truss with proper triangulation is essential to distribute loads efficiently. Reducing number of nodes or repositioning intermediate nodes to form stable triangles can reduce stress. Using moderate area_id values (e.g., 2 or 3) for members with moderate force and smaller areas (0 or 1) for less stressed members can reduce mass. Avoiding very large cross sections reduces mass but must keep stress below limits. The load at node_3 should be transferred efficiently through members to supports at node_1 and node_2.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss to a 5-node configuration with nodes at supports (node_1 and node_2), load node_3 fixed at (2.0, 0.0), and two top nodes (node_4 and node_5) at (1.5, 3.0) and (4.5, 3.0) respectively. Connect nodes to form a fully triangulated closed truss: bottom chord (node_1-node_3-node_2), top chord (node_4-node_5), and diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_2). This configuration is simpler, fully triangulated, and likely to reduce stress and mass. Use area_id \'2\' or \'3\' for main load carrying members and smaller areas for diagonals.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Symmetry about the vertical axis through node_3 balances load paths. Triangulation ensures structural stability and load transfer without bending. The top chord nodes at 3.0m height create a deep truss reducing member forces. Diagonals create efficient load paths from loaded node_3 to supports. Node_3 is fixed to preserve load application. Supports at node_1 and node_2 remain unchanged. Using moderate cross-sectional areas balances stress and mass. This design avoids over-stressing members and keeps mass under 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members behave as axial force elements. Load at node_3 resolved into x and y components: Fx = -10*cos(45°) = -7.07, Fy = -10*sin(45°) = -7.07. Calculate member lengths via distance formula. Mass = sum(length * area_id). Stress proportional to axial force / area. Cross sections selected to keep max stress ≤ 20. Check equilibrium at nodes for force balance. Member connections chosen to ensure closed, triangulated structure.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1 (0.00, 0.00), node_2 (6.00, 0.00), node_3 (2.00, 0.00), node_4 (1.50, 3.00), node_5 (4.50, 3.00).

Assign area_id: \'3\' (1.759) for bottom chord and top chord members; \'2\' (0.782) for diagonals.
