The objective is to generate a closed 2D truss structure that satisfies max stress ±20 and total mass ≤ 30 with given loads and supports, minimizing stress and mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The load is a -10N force at node_3 at -45°, supports are pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current nodes form a partial trapezoid with 5 nodes. Members connect base nodes and top nodes with diagonals. Max stress is high in member_1 (node_1-node_3). Mass is moderate but stress limit is violated.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current design concentrates high compressive stress (-48.35) in member_1 (node_1-node_3) due to load at node_3 and support conditions. The structure lacks sufficient triangulation and redundant load paths to distribute forces effectively. The generation history shows attempts with added nodes and members but still violating stress constraints. Structures with more triangulation (e.g., adding node_6 at center) reduce max stress but still exceed limits. The rectangular base with top chord and diagonals is a good starting shape but needs better area distribution and possibly repositioning of nodes for load path optimization. Load at node_3 is near the base, causing high stress in short members. Supports at nodes 1 and 2 fix horizontal and vertical displacements, but the load path is direct and concentrates stress.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns indicate that adding a central node and increasing triangulation helps reduce stress. However, area assignments must be optimized to prevent overloading short members. The top chord should be continuous and connected to base nodes with diagonals forming triangles. Node positions should maintain support and load nodes fixed. The load at node_3 suggests strengthening members connecting node_3 to base and top nodes. The member areas should be chosen from the given discrete set to balance mass and stress. Mass limit is generous (30), so increasing some member areas is acceptable to reduce stress below 20. Symmetry and triangulation are key for load distribution.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss as a symmetric, closed trapezoidal truss with 6 nodes: base nodes at (0,0), (6,0), load node fixed at (2,0), two top chord nodes at (1.5,3) and (4.5,3), and a central node at (3,1.5). Members form a closed polygon with triangulation: base chord, top chord, diagonals from base to top, and diagonals connecting to the center node. This structure ensures multiple load paths, reduces stress concentration, and keeps mass within limits. Areas will be assigned larger for high-stress members and smaller for others to optimize mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Using triangulation reduces bending moments and distributes load effectively. The central node shares load from node_3 to supports. Keeping node_3 fixed at (2.0,0.0) respects load position. Supports at node_1 and node_2 remain fixed. The top chord nodes at (1.5,3) and (4.5,3) create a stable top frame. Members connecting node_3 to the center and top nodes reduce stress in base members. Area selection prioritizes members under higher stress with larger cross-section areas (area_id \'4\' or \'5\'), while others use smaller areas (area_id \'1\' or \'2\') to minimize mass. This design is closed, fully connected, and symmetric.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic behavior, axial forces only. Calculate member lengths via Euclidean distance. Estimate member forces by static equilibrium at nodes using force balance (sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0). Use trigonometric relations for member force components. Stress = Force / Area. Mass = sum(member length × area). Assign areas to keep max stress ≤ 20. Areas chosen from given discrete set. Node positions fixed for supports and load; others chosen for symmetry and load path. Members: base chord (node_1-node_2), top chord (node_4-node_5), diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_5, node_4-node_6, node_5-node_6, node_6-node_3, node_3-node_1, node_3-node_2).",\n    \n    "calculation": "Calculated member lengths: node_1-node_2 = 6.0, node_4-node_5 = 3.0, node_1-node_4 ≈ 3.354, node_2-node_5 ≈ 3.354, node_4-node_6 ≈ 1.803, node_5-node_6 ≈ 1.803, node_6-node_3 ≈ 1.803, node_3-node_1 = 2.0, node_3-node_2 = 4.0. Assign areas to keep stress ≤ 20: high stress members (node_3-node_1, node_3-node_2, node_6-node_3) get area_id \'4\' (3.128), others get \'2\' (0.782) or \'1\' (0.195).
