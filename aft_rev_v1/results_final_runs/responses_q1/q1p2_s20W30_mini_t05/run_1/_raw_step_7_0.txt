The objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss that satisfies max stress ±20 and mass ≤30, while maintaining supports and load nodes fixed, minimizing stress and mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given a single downward-left diagonal load at node_3, pinned support at node_1 and roller at node_2, the current design has a complex internal node_6 but still experiences high stress (member_4 at 37.64). Historical structures with simpler topologies show lower stresses but higher mass or constraint violations. The structure must be closed and fully triangulated to distribute load efficiently and reduce stress concentrations.",\n\n  "analysis": "The load at node_3 (-10, -45°) induces tension and compression in members connected to node_3. The high stress on member_4 (node_4 to node_5) suggests poor load transfer along the top chord. The node_6 internal point creates complex force paths but does not sufficiently reduce stress. The pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 provide stable boundary conditions. Historical designs with fewer nodes or less triangulation have higher max stress or mass. The structure needs a balanced triangulation with strong top and bottom chords and diagonals to spread forces and avoid overstressing any member. The current member areas (mostly \'2\' = 0.782) may be insufficient in top chord members carrying high tension/compression.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns show that adding diagonals to form triangles and using moderate to larger cross-sectional areas on top and bottom chords reduces max stress. Node repositioning within constraints could help but load and support nodes are fixed. The internal node_6 complicates force paths but doesn\'t solve stress issues. A simpler, symmetric trapezoidal truss with 5 nodes (fixed supports and load nodes) and triangulated members is promising. Using area_id \'3\' (1.759) or \'4\' (3.128) for critical members can reduce stress while keeping mass under 30.",\n\n  "proposal": "Redesign a closed trapezoidal truss with nodes: node_1 (0,0, pinned), node_2 (6,0, roller), node_3 (2,0, load), node_4 (1.5,3), node_5 (4.5,3). Connect top chord (node_4-node_5), bottom chord (node_1-node_3-node_2), and triangulate fully with diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_5, node_3-node_4, node_3-node_5). Use area_id \'3\' or \'4\' for chords and diagonals to balance stress and mass.",\n\n  "reasoning": "A trapezoidal shape with top chord nodes at y=3 and bottom chord nodes at y=0 matches previous designs but adds node_3 load point on bottom chord for load application. Triangulation ensures no member is excessively loaded. The load at node_3 is transferred through diagonals to top chord and supports. Using larger area_ids on top chord and main diagonals reduces stress. The roller and pinned supports provide statically determinate support preventing instability. The design is symmetric about the vertical line through node_3, promoting balanced load paths.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic behavior, axial forces only. Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance. Member force estimation by static equilibrium and truss method: sum forces in x and y zero, sum moments zero. Mass = sum(length × area). Use area_id \'3\' (1.759) for chords, \'4\' (3.128) for diagonals. Estimate max stress = force / area. Ensure max stress ≤ 20 and total mass ≤ 30.
