Objective is to minimize stress further while keeping mass <= 30 and max stress <= ±20.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given pinned support at node_1 and roller at node_2, load applied at node_3 downward-left (-10N, 45deg). Current structure is a pentagon with diagonal bracing (members 3-7). Areas mostly moderate (area_ids 2 and 3). Max stress 6.74 well below ±20, mass 26.5 below 30 limit.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current load path transfers load at node_3 through members 1,2,4,5 to supports at nodes 1 and 2. Members 3 and 7 form top chord. Stress distribution is moderate, max tensile at member_3 (6.74), max compressive at member_4 (-6.11). Mass distributed mostly in members 1,2,7. Structure is stable, closed, no isolated nodes. History shows attempts to reduce stress by modifying node_4 and node_5 positions and member areas, but some designs violated stress or mass constraints. Current design is best among feasible ones.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress is well balanced, no member near ±20 limit. Mass is close to limit but not exceeded. No floating nodes or disconnected members. Further stress reduction may be marginal. Node positions for supports and load are fixed. Nodes 4 and 5 can be slightly adjusted to improve load distribution. Member areas can be fine-tuned to reduce mass without raising stress.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Optimize current design by slightly adjusting nodes 4 and 5 coordinates to improve triangulation and reduce stress peaks, and reassign member areas to balance stress and reduce mass. Keep same connectivity as current best design to preserve closed truss and stability.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangulation ensures stability and load transfer. Slightly raising node_4 and lowering node_5 may improve stress distribution by balancing force paths. Member areas can be reduced for low-stress members and increased for critical ones. Use area_id values close to current (2 and 3) but reduce where possible to save mass. Keep pinned and roller supports fixed. Maintain symmetry for load distribution.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths from node coordinates. Calculate member forces using equilibrium equations for 2D truss with given loads/supports. Calculate stress = force / area. Calculate mass = sum(length * area_density). Constraints: max |stress| <= 20, total mass <= 30. Adjust node_4 y from 3.00 to 2.85, node_5 y from 3.00 to 2.75 to improve triangulation. Adjust member areas: reduce area_id from \'3\' to \'2\' where stress low, increase to \'4\' for members near max stress.
