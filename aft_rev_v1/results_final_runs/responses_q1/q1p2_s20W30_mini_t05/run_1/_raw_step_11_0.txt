Objective is to minimize max stress further while keeping mass ≤ 30 and max stress ≤ ±20.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "The current truss is a 5-node, 7-member structure with nodes 1 and 2 supported (pinned and roller) and a load at node 3. Member areas vary among area_id 2 and 3. Constraints are max stress ±20 and mass ≤30.",\n  "analysis": "The current structure has max stress 6.74 well below ±20 and mass 26.509 below 30. Load at node 3 (-10 at -45°) induces compression in member_3 (6.74) and tension in member_1 (-5.36). Members forming the triangular top (nodes 4 and 5) help distribute load. History shows attempts with extra nodes or different layouts resulted in constraint violations or higher mass. Current design is symmetric, triangulated, and connected. Member areas are moderate; some members with high stress have smaller cross-section (area_id 2), others larger (area_id 3).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Current design is efficient and satisfies constraints with margin. No constraint violations observed. The truss is well triangulated and load paths are direct. Mass is moderate, and max stress is low. Attempts to add nodes or change configuration increased mass or stress. Minor node repositioning might improve stress distribution, but fixed supports and load nodes cannot move. Member area optimization might reduce stress further.",\n  "proposal": "Optimize cross-sectional areas of members to reduce max stress while maintaining mass ≤30. Keep current node positions fixed for supports and load nodes, slightly adjust free nodes (4 and 5) within small range to improve load distribution. Maintain current member connectivity as it is closed and triangulated.",\n  "reasoning": "Load at node 3 induces compression in members connected to it. Increasing area in high stress members (member_3 and member_1) reduces stress. Slightly adjusting nodes 4 and 5 vertically or horizontally can balance load paths and reduce peak stress. Member_7 (top chord) with area_id 3 can be slightly reduced if stress is low to save mass. Members with low stress can have reduced area to save mass and reallocate to critical members.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: uniform material density, linear elastic behavior, stress proportional to force/area. Calculate member lengths using node coordinates. Mass = sum(length × area). Stress = force / area. Adjust areas from area_id set {0:1,1:0.195,2:0.782,3:1.759,...}. Node_4 and node_5 can move within ±0.2 in x and y to improve geometry. Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Iterate to keep max stress ≤20 and mass ≤30.",\n  "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1:(0.00,0.00), node_2:(6.00,0.00), node_3:(2.00,0.00). Adjust node_4 from (1.50,3.00) to (1.40,2.85), node_5 from (4.50,3.00) to (4.55,2.80). Calculate member lengths and update mass. Assign member areas: member_3 (node_1-node_4) area_id 3 (1.759), member_1 and member_2 area_id 4 (3.128) to reduce stress, member_4, member_5, member_6 area_id 2 (0.782), member_7 area_id 2 (0.782).
