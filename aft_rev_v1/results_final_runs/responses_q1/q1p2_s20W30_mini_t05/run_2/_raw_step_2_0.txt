The objective is to generate a closed 2D truss satisfying max stress ≤ ±20 and total mass ≤ 30, while maintaining given supports and loads.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given load at node_3 (-10N at -45°), pinned support at node_1 and roller at node_2, current design shows stress concentration in members connected to node_5 and node_4. The structure is somewhat irregular with node_5 close to node_3 and node_4. The max stress is in member_8 (node_5-node_2). Mass is within limit but stresses exceed constraints.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 creates tension/compression in horizontal and diagonal members. The current structure has a complicated internal node_5 causing stress concentration. The history shows simpler 4-node truss with fewer members but higher max stress (~36). Current design\'s high stress in members connected to node_5 and node_4 indicates inefficient load transfer. The triangular substructures are not optimally arranged. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) create a classic simply supported span. The load at node_3 is eccentric causing bending effects. The structure must be triangulated and symmetric to distribute load efficiently and reduce peak stresses.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Irregular node placement and redundant members increase stress. Reducing nodes and creating a symmetric, triangulated, closed truss with fewer but well-placed members should improve stress distribution. Avoid node_5 which causes stress concentration. Use nodes at supports and load plus one or two intermediate nodes to form a stable triangular framework.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss using 4 nodes: node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 (load), and node_4 elevated to form a symmetric triangular truss. Connect nodes to form a closed triangle with a diagonal member to ensure triangulation and load path. Assign cross-sectional areas to keep stresses ≤ ±20 and total mass ≤ 30.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A triangular truss with nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), and (3,3.5) forms a stable, symmetric structure. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, and node_3-node_4 create a closed triangulated frame. This distributes load efficiently from node_3 to supports. Using moderate cross-sectional areas balances stress and mass. Node_4 height chosen to reduce bending moment and allow effective load transfer. No node repositioning of supports or load nodes per instructions.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic behavior, static equilibrium, uniform axial stress in members. Calculate member lengths via distance formula. Approximate member forces by resolving load at node_3 into components and using static equilibrium equations. Cross-sectional areas chosen from area_id to keep stresses ≤ 20. Mass = sum(length * area). Iterate area selection to satisfy constraints. Use trigonometry for member angles and forces.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(3,3.5).
