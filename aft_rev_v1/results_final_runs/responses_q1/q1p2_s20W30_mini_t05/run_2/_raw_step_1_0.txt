The objective is to generate a closed 2D truss structure that satisfies max stress ≤ ±20 and total mass ≤ 30, while maintaining supports and load positions fixed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The load is a 10N force at node_3 directed -45° downward. Supports are pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 on the horizontal base line. Current node_3 is between node_1 and node_2 on x-axis, node_4 is above node_3. The structure is a simple triangle plus a diagonal member. Max stress violation occurs at member_4 (node_3-node_4) with -36.26 compressive stress. Mass is acceptable. The structure is not fully triangulated (not fully closed) and stress concentration is high on member_4.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current structure has a triangular shape with nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), and (2,3). The load at node_3 induces large compressive stress on the diagonal member_4. The base members (node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2) carry some load but are less stressed. The top members (node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4) are in tension but with low stress. The member_4 is a short diagonal carrying large compressive load, causing the violation. The structure is not fully triangulated; node_3 is colinear with nodes 1 and 2, reducing stiffness. Adding more members to triangulate the structure can distribute forces better. The supports fix horizontal (roller) and both directions (pinned) at base. The load direction and magnitude cause bending and compression. The history shows no better structure; redesign is needed to reduce peak stress and maintain mass below 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The key issue is the high compressive stress in the diagonal member_4 due to the load at node_3. The structure lacks full triangulation and redundant load paths. Node_3 on the base line leads to a weak joint under load. Increasing the height of node_4 or adding additional nodes and members to form multiple triangles will improve load distribution. Using larger cross-sectional areas on highly stressed members and smaller on others can optimize mass. The load and supports are fixed, so node positions except loaded/support nodes can be adjusted for better geometry.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the structure by repositioning node_4 higher (around 4.0 m vertical) to increase the height of the truss, add a new node_5 above node_3 to create two triangles sharing the load, and add members to form a fully triangulated closed truss. Keep node_1 and node_2 at base, node_3 fixed on base line. Use cross-sectional areas from area_id to keep stresses under ±20 and mass under 30.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation is critical for 2D truss stability and load distribution. Raising node_4 increases the truss height, reducing compressive forces in diagonals. Adding node_5 directly above node_3 creates two triangular panels distributing load from node_3 better. Members from node_3 to node_5 and node_5 to node_4 create multiple load paths. Cross-sectional areas will be assigned larger on members under compression and tension near the load and smaller elsewhere to optimize mass. Node_3 remains fixed on the base to maintain load application point. Supports remain unchanged.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: members behave as axial force members only, load applied at node_3 is 10N at -45°.
