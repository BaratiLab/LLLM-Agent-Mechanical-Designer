Objective is to minimize stress under ±20 limit and total mass ≤ 30 using given discrete cross-sectional areas.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes are colinear on x-axis: node_1(0,0), node_3(2,0), node_2(6,0). Load at node_3 is -10 units at -45°, supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current structure is a line, not closed. Need additional node(s) to form closed truss and triangulate for stability and stress reduction.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 acts diagonally down-left, inducing bending and axial forces. Supports restrain horizontal and vertical at node_1 and vertical only at node_2. Colinear nodes create a weak structure under lateral loads. Triangulation needed to distribute forces and reduce member stresses. Closed truss requires at least one additional node off the line to form triangles. Member forces will depend on geometry and cross-sectional areas. Mass is sum of member lengths × area. Stress = force / area; area chosen from given discrete set.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a node above the line near node_3 can create two triangles: (node_1, node_3, new_node) and (node_3, node_2, new_node). This provides load paths to both supports and triangulation for stability. Choosing moderate area sizes for longer members and smaller for shorter members balances mass and stress. The new node\'s y-coordinate should be positive and optimized for load distribution.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Place new node (node_4) at (2.0, 3.0) to form an equilateral-like triangle with node_1 and node_3 (length ~3.0). Connect members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_2-node_4. This forms a closed, triangulated structure. Assign larger areas to longer members (node_2-node_4, node_1-node_4) to reduce stress, smaller areas to shorter members. This distributes load efficiently and keeps mass under 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic members, axial forces only, load at node_3 decomposed into Fx = -10*cos(45°) ≈ -7.07, Fy = -10*sin(45°) ≈ -7.07. Static equilibrium: sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, sum moments=0. Calculate member lengths, then forces in members by method of joints or sections. Stress = force / area, mass = sum(length*area).
