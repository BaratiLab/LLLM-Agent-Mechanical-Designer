The goal is to redesign a closed 2D truss with optimized node placement and member sizing to reduce mass below 30 while keeping stresses within ±20 under the given load and supports.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given load is a -10 force at node_3 at -45°, supports are pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current structure has 4 nodes with members forming a partial triangle with a diagonal. Max stress is from member_2 (-12.09), mass is high due to large area members (area_id \'5\' = 4.887) on longer members. Constraints: max stress ±20, total mass ≤ 30.",\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 downward-left (45°) induces tension/compression in members connected to node_3. The pinned support at node_1 and roller at node_2 provide statically determinate boundary conditions. Current structure is a trapezoid with a diagonal. Member_2 is highly stressed with smallest area (1), causing stress concentration. Large areas on longer members increase mass. The structure is closed but inefficient in load distribution and mass. History shows no better design yet.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Stress concentration on member_2 suggests need for better load path or increased area there. Mass can be reduced by lowering areas on less stressed members and repositioning nodes to shorten members. Adding a fifth node to form a symmetric, triangulated, closed truss can improve load distribution and reduce stress peaks. Maintaining supports and loaded node positions is mandatory.",\n    "proposal": "Redesign to a 5-node closed truss forming a symmetric pentagon-like shape with triangulated members. Keep node_1 and node_2 at supports, node_3 at load position fixed. Add two new nodes above the base line to create a stable, well-triangulated structure. Use smaller cross-sectional areas for longer members and increase areas only where stress is high. This will reduce mass below 30 and keep stresses under ±20.",\n    "reasoning": "Symmetry improves load distribution, triangulation ensures structural stability and reduces bending. Adding nodes at (1.5, 2.5) and (4.5, 2.5) creates two top nodes forming triangles with base nodes. Members connect all nodes to form a closed polygon with internal diagonals. Areas are assigned based on member length and expected stress: shorter members get smaller areas, longer members with high stress get moderate areas. This balances mass and strength.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members behave as axial force members, linear elastic, uniform area. Calculate member lengths by Euclidean distance. Mass = sum(length × area). Stress estimated by force equilibrium and geometry. Area choices from given discrete set. Node_3, node_1, node_2 fixed. New nodes at (1.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5). Members: base (node_1-node_2), sides (node_1-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_4-node_2), diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_5-node_2, node_3-node_5, node_3-node_4, node_3-node_1, node_3-node_2).
