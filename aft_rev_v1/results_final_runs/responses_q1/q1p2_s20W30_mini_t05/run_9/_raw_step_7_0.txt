The objective is to generate a closed 2D truss structure that satisfies both stress and mass constraints while minimizing stress and maintaining given loads and supports.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "The load is a -10N force at node_3 at -45 degrees. Supports are pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 along x-axis. The current structure is a quadrilateral with diagonal members but max stress exceeds limits. Mass is within limit but stress is too high.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The current structure is a 4-node trapezoidal truss with members connecting nodes 1-3, 3-4, 4-1, 4-2, and 2-3. The highest stress occurs in member_3 (node_4 to node_1) at 34.19, exceeding ±20 constraint. Member_4 also has high stress (17.09). Load at node_3 is diagonal downward left, causing tension/compression in members. The supports fix node_1 fully and node_2 vertically. The structure lacks sufficient triangulation near node_3 to distribute load efficiently, causing high stress in members connected to node_4 and node_1. Historical designs with additional nodes and members reduced stress but increased mass above 30 or had stress violations. The current structure has minimal nodes but insufficient triangulation and member sizing to reduce stress.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns show adding a fifth node near the loaded node_3 and forming multiple triangles reduces max stress by sharing load paths. Increasing cross-sectional areas near high-stress members helps but risks mass increase. Keeping node_1 and node_2 fixed as supports is mandatory. Positioning new nodes to create stable triangulated substructures near load is beneficial. Avoid long slender members that cause high stress.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a fifth node near node_3 above the baseline to form two triangles sharing the load. Connect this new node to node_1, node_2, and node_3 to create a closed truss with multiple load paths. Assign cross-sectional areas to members to keep stress within ±20 and total mass below 30. Keep node_1 and node_2 fixed. Use moderate cross-sectional areas (area_id 3 to 5) for longer members and smaller areas for shorter members to minimize mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangulation is key to distributing loads and reducing member forces and stress. Adding node_5 at (3.0, 2.0) creates two triangles: (node_1, node_5, node_3) and (node_2, node_5, node_3), sharing the load at node_3. This reduces stress concentration on members connected directly to node_1 and node_4. The original node_4 is removed to simplify and reduce stress concentration. Members connecting node_5 to supports and loaded node create multiple load paths. Cross-sectional areas are selected to keep stress below 20 and total mass under 30. The load magnitude and direction at node_3 remain unchanged. Supports remain fixed. The structure is fully closed with no isolated nodes.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic behavior, static equilibrium. Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance. Member force estimated by resolving load at node_3 through triangulated members using force equilibrium. Stress = Force / Area; choose area to keep stress ≤ 20. Mass = sum(length × area). Use area_id values: \'0\':1, \'1\':0.195, \'2\':0.782, \'3\':1.759, \'4\':3.128, \'5\':4.887. Calculate member lengths for mass. Balance forces in x and y at node_3. Assign larger areas to longer members and those under higher load. Verify max stress and total mass.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_5(3,2). Member lengths: node_1-node_3=2m, node_3-node_5=sqrt(1^2+2^2)=2.236m, node_5-node_1=sqrt(3^2+2^2)=3.606m, node_5-node_2=sqrt(3^2+2^2)=3.606m, node_2-node_3=4m.

Estimated mass = sum(length*area): (2*0.782)+(2.236*1.759)+(3.606*3.128)+(3.606*3.128)+(4*0.782) = 1.564 + 3.93 + 11.28 + 11.28 + 3.128 = ~31.18 (slightly above 30). Reduce area of node_5-node_1 and node_5-node_2 to \'3\' (1.759) to reduce mass: mass approx 1.564 + 3.93 + 6.34 + 6.34 + 3.128 = 21.3 < 30.
