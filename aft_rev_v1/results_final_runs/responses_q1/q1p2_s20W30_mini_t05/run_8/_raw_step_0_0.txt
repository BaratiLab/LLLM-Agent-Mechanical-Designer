Objective is to minimize stress within ±20 limit and total mass ≤30 using discrete area selections, ensuring full connectivity and triangulation for stability.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes form a line: node_1(0,0), node_3(2,0), node_2(6,0). Load of magnitude 10 at 45° down-left on node_3. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Need a closed truss (triangle or more complex) connecting these nodes. Minimum closed structure is a triangle. Current line is colinear, no closed polygon. Need at least one new node off the line to close the truss.",\n\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 has components Fx = -10*cos(45°) ≈ -7.07, Fy = -10*sin(45°) ≈ -7.07. Supports at node_1 and node_2 restrict horizontal and vertical reactions (pinned at node_1 fixes both directions, roller at node_2 fixes vertical). Current nodes colinear, no closed structure. Without closure, structure is unstable under lateral load. Introducing a new node above the line to form a triangle will create triangulation and distribute forces efficiently. Stress in members depends on axial force / area. Mass depends on member length × area. Choosing minimal cross-sections that keep stress ≤20 is critical.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation is essential for stability and minimizing stress. The new node should be placed to maximize structural efficiency, likely above node_3 between node_1 and node_2 horizontally. Member connections: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4 plus existing node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2. This forms a closed polygon with four nodes and five members. Symmetry and load path efficiency suggest placing node_4 at about x=3.5, y=3.0 to reduce member lengths and distribute load evenly.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Place node_4 at (3.5, 3.0) to form a stable triangular shape with node_1, node_2 and node_3. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4. This closes the truss. Use smaller areas on shorter members and larger on longer or high force members. Estimate forces by static equilibrium and trigonometry, select area_id to keep stress ≤20. Prioritize area_id: \'3\' (1.759) to \'6\' (7.037) for balance between mass and strength. Check total mass ≤30.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members only carry axial load. Forces resolved by equilibrium: sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, sum moments=0.
