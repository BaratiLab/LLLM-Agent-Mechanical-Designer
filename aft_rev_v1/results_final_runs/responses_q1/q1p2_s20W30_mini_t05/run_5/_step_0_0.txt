    "preamble": "Designing a closed 2D truss connecting three given nodes with a load at node_3 and supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Objective is to minimize stress under ±20 limit and total mass ≤ 30, using given discrete cross-sectional areas.",

    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes form a line along x-axis: node_1 (0,0), node_3 (2,0), node_2 (6,0). Load at node_3 is -10 N at -45°, supports fixed at ends. Initial structure is a straight beam, which is unstable laterally and cannot be closed. Need to add nodes and members to form a closed triangulated truss.",

    "analysis": "The load at node_3 has vertical and horizontal components (~-7.07 N vertical down, -7.07 N horizontal left). Supports at node_1 pinned (both directions restrained), node_2 roller (vertical restrained). The initial colinear nodes cannot form a stable truss or closed loop. To resist load and minimize stress, triangulation is required. Adding a node above the baseline near node_3 will create two triangles, ensuring closure and stability. Members must be selected to transfer load efficiently, avoid excessive length or area to keep mass ≤ 30. Stress limit ±20 requires careful area sizing.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a node above node_3 at (2.0, 3.0) creates two triangles: (node_1, node_3, new_node) and (node_3, node_2, new_node). This forms a closed truss with 4 nodes and 5 members. Members along baseline and diagonals distribute load. Short diagonals reduce stress. Choosing moderate area for baseline (area_id '1'=0.195) and larger area for diagonals (area_id '3'=1.759) balances mass and stress. This configuration should keep stress within limits and mass under 30.",

    "reasoning": "Triangulated truss with new node_4 at (2.0, 3.0). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2 (baseline), node_1-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_2-node_4 (diagonals). Baseline members carry axial force, diagonals carry tension/compression from load. Larger area for diagonals reduces stress. Load path: node_3 load transfers via diagonals to supports. This layout ensures closed structure, stability, and efficient load transfer.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic behavior, axial forces only, uniform cross-section per member. Calculate member lengths, forces by static equilibrium at nodes. Use trigonometry for member angles. Calculate stress = force / area. Mass = sum(length × area). Select areas from given IDs to satisfy stress ≤ 20 and mass ≤ 30.",

    "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2,3). Member lengths: L_13=2.0, L_32=4.0, L_14=√(2²+3²)=3.6056, L_34=3.0, L_24=√(4²+3²)=5.0. Assign areas: baseline members (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2) area_id '1' = 0.195; diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_2-node_4) area_id '3' = 1.759. Approximate axial forces from equilibrium at node_3 under load (-10 N at -45°). Member forces ~ ±14 N max. Stress = force/area: max stress ≈ 14/0.195=71.8 (too high) for baseline; diagonals stress 14/1.759=7.96 (within limit). To reduce baseline stress, increase their area to '3' =1.759. New max stress ~14/1.759=7.96 < 20. Mass = sum(length × area): baseline (2+4)*1.759=10.554, diagonals (3.6056+3+5)*1.759=18.77, total=29.32 < 30. Constraints satisfied.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "Final design: 4 nodes, 5 members forming two triangles. Areas: all members area_id '3' (1.759) for stress ≤ 20. Total mass 29.32 ≤ 30. Structure is closed, stable, and load paths efficient. No duplicate nodes or members. Coordinates precise to 0.01.",
