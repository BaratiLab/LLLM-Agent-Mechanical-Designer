Objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss minimizing max stress below ±20 and total mass ≤30, respecting fixed supports and load node positions.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given: Load at node_3 downward-left (-10N, 45°), supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 on horizontal base. Current nodes mostly on base and two nodes elevated ~2.8 height. Members form a partially triangulated frame but max tensile stress in member_3 (node_1-node_5) is 26.3 exceeding limit, indicating overstressed member. Mass is acceptable but stress constraint violated.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 induces compression/tension in members connected to it and adjacent nodes. Node_1 pinned and node_2 roller provide stable boundary. Current structure has 5 nodes with some triangulation but member areas are uneven and some members are overstressed (member_3). History shows better max stress (~11) but mass increase beyond 30. The current design likely fails due to insufficient triangulation or poor load transfer from node_3 to supports, causing stress concentration in member_3. The structure is closed but node_5 position near node_3 and node_4 seems suboptimal for stress distribution. Historic best design has node_4 at (3.1,3.0) and node_5 at (1.0,3.0), with member_3 area increased and max stress ~11 but mass ~24.7, which is feasible but not minimal mass. The last historic designs with fewer nodes have higher max stress and lower mass but violate stress constraints. Load path should be symmetrically distributed from node_3 to supports via triangulated members. The current design\'s high stress in member_3 indicates need for better load path or larger cross section for that member.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Insight: Increasing triangulation improves load distribution and reduces peak stress. Node_4 and node_5 elevated near 3.0 height help form triangles with base nodes. Using area_id 3 or 4 for critical members balances stress and mass. Avoid node positions too close causing short members with high stress. Maintain fixed node_1 and node_2 positions due to supports. Load node_3 fixed at (2.0,0.0). Optimal design likely a trapezoidal shape with nodes at base and two elevated nodes spaced to form triangles with node_3. Member areas assigned to keep stress under 20 and mass under 30.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Adopt a 5-node trapezoidal closed truss with nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (3.1,3.0), node_5 (1.0,3.0). Members connect all nodes to form triangulated closed frame. Use area_id \'3\' (1.759) for critical members (node_1-node_5, node_5-node_4), area_id \'2\' (0.782) for others. This structure is from best historic design with adjusted member areas to reduce max stress below 20 and total mass under 30.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation ensures load transfer from node_3 to supports via nodes 4 and 5, reducing stress concentration. Node_5 at (1.0,3.0) and node_4 at (3.1,3.0) spaced to form stable triangles with base nodes. Larger area (1.759) for members node_1-node_5 and node_5-node_4 reduces stress in these critical members. Other members use moderate area (0.782) to save mass. This balances mass and stress constraints. Node_3 fixed due to load, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Closed truss with 8 members ensures no isolated nodes.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members are pin-jointed, axial forces only. Load at node_3 is -10N at 45° (components Fx=-7.07N, Fy=-7.07N). Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance. Calculate member forces by static equilibrium at nodes. Stress proportional to force/cross-sectional area. Mass proportional to length × area. Use areas from area_id dictionary. Target max stress ≤20 and total mass ≤30. Assign areas accordingly.
