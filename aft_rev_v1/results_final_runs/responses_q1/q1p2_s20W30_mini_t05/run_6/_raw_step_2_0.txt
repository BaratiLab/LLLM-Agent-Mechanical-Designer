The objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss that meets max stress ≤ ±20 and total mass ≤ 30, while preserving support and load node positions.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given load is a -10 force at node_3 at -45°, supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current nodes form a roughly trapezoidal shape with an extra node_5. Members are many and heavy, causing mass >30. Stress distribution shows member_1 highly stressed (-11.05). The structure is not optimal and violates mass constraint.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 creates tension/compression in members connected there. Supports at nodes 1 and 2 fix the base. Current members include multiple diagonals and verticals between nodes 3,4,5 causing redundancy and excess mass. The structure is closed but inefficient. Historical structure with 4 nodes and 5 members had lower mass but excessive max stress (38.22). The most stressed member currently is member_1 (node_1-node_3). Load path is not well balanced. The current design uses large cross sections (area_id 4) on some members adding to mass. The presence of node_5 adds complexity but doesn\'t reduce stress significantly.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The pattern shows that reducing member sizes and simplifying the truss while maintaining triangulation may reduce mass and stress. Avoiding large cross sections on heavily stressed members and repositioning nodes to distribute load better may help. Node_5 could be removed or repositioned. The load at node_3 is critical and must be supported by a strong triangular system between nodes 1,2,3 and possibly node_4.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign a 4-node closed truss with nodes 1,2,3 fixed and node_4 repositioned to form a stable triangle with node_3 elevated to distribute load. Remove node_5 to reduce complexity and mass. Use minimal necessary cross sections to keep stress within ±20 and total mass ≤30. Members: base (1-2), two diagonals (1-4, 2-4), vertical (3-4), and base diagonals (1-3, 2-3) to form a stable, closed truss.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Using a simple triangular truss with node_4 elevated above the base line creates efficient load paths and reduces member lengths. This distributes the -10 force at node_3 better. Removing node_5 reduces member count and mass. Symmetry about base line helps balance stresses. Cross sections will be chosen from area_id set to keep stress ≤20 and mass ≤30.
