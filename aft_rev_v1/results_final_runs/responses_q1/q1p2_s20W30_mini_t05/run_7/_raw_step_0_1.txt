Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) fix boundary conditions. Objective is a stable, triangulated structure with optimized cross-sectional areas.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Load at node_3 = 10 units downward-left at 45°. Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Constraints: max stress ±20, total mass ≤30. Initial structure is a line, not closed or triangulated. Need to add nodes and members to form closed truss and distribute load.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current nodes lie on x-axis; load at node_3 is diagonal down-left. Without vertical members or triangulation, structure will have high bending and stress. Supports fix horizontal and vertical at node_1, vertical only at node_2. To form a closed truss, add a node above node_3 to create triangles. Load path should be direct from node_3 to supports via triangulated members. Failure likely from bending or axial overload on members if not triangulated. Mass constraint limits large cross sections.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation is key: form two triangles sharing node_3 and new node above it. This distributes load into axial forces, reducing stress. Adding a new node above node_3 at about y=3.0 forms a triangle with node_1 and node_2. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-new_node, node_2-new_node, node_3-new_node. This creates a trapezoidal closed shape with triangulation. Cross-sectional areas can be varied to balance mass and stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) above node_3 to form two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4). This closed shape triangulates the structure, improves load transfer, and reduces bending. Use smaller areas on longer members and larger areas on members directly under load to keep stress within limits and mass low. This approach ensures load path is direct, structure is stable, and constraints are met.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members carry axial forces only.
