The goal is to generate a closed 2D truss satisfying max stress ±20 and total mass ≤30 under a -10N 45° load at node_3 with supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller).",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes and members form a partial truss with members of large area (7 and 3) causing high mass. Load applied at node_3 on bottom chord with no effective load path to supports. Constraints violated: mass and ineffective stress distribution.",\n  "analysis": "Current structure is open and lacks triangulation for load transfer. Members 4 and 5 connect node_3 to nodes 4 and 5 but no direct connection from node_3 to supports. The load at node_3 is not effectively transferred to supports at node_1 and node_2. Member areas are large causing mass >30. The structure is not statically determinate and not closed. History shows no improvement. Failure modes: excessive mass and zero stress due to load path discontinuity.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Need a closed truss with triangulation ensuring load path from node_3 to supports. Reduce member areas to lower mass. Keep nodes with loads and supports fixed. Add nodes or reposition intermediate nodes to form triangles. Use smaller area members where possible. Symmetry and triangulation will improve performance.",\n  "proposal": "Redesign truss as a closed triangular truss with 4 nodes: node_1 (0,0, pinned), node_2 (6,0, roller), node_3 (2,0, load), and node_4 (3.5,2.5) added to form triangles. Connect members to form a closed truss: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4. Use smaller area members (area_id \'2\' or \'3\') to reduce mass below 30 and ensure max stress ≤20.",\n  "reasoning": "Triangulation ensures load transfer from node_3 to supports. Node_4 added above the chord line to form two triangles (node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_2-node_3-node_4). This distributes load and reduces member length. Smaller cross sections reduce mass. Supports fixed, load at node_3 fixed. Geometry chosen to balance member lengths and angles for efficient load transfer.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members are axial only, uniform material density. Calculate member lengths by Euclidean distance. Mass = sum(length × area). Use area_id values from given set. Estimate forces by static equilibrium at loaded node_3 and supports. Check max axial stress = force/area ≤20. Adjust area_id accordingly.
