    "preamble": "Current structure is a 4-node truss with 5 members, supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller), and a load at node 3. Current max stress is 13.06 and total mass 25.11, within constraints. Objective is to minimize max stress further while keeping structure closed and constraints satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress (13.06) is well below ±20 limit, mass (25.11) below 30 limit. Load at node 3 (-10N at -45°) induces tension/compression in members. Current structure is a triangle with an internal node 3 on base, and a vertical node 4 forming a triangle top. Members sized with areas 2 or 3. Need to check if stress distribution can be improved by adjusting member areas or node 4 position.",
    
    "analysis": "Load at node 3 downward-left causes high compression in member_1 (node_1-node_3) at -13.06. Member_2 (node_3-node_2) has lower compression (-4.02). Members connected to node_4 (node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_4-node_2) have moderate tensile/compressive stresses (2.2 to 4.0). The asymmetry of node_3 location (2.0m from node_1 on base 6m) concentrates load causing high stress in member_1. Node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) forms a triangle with base. Slight repositioning of node_4 upwards or rightwards can redistribute forces and reduce stress in member_1. Member areas can be optimized to reduce mass while keeping stresses within limits. Current areas are 2 or 3 (0.782 or 1.759). Possibly reduce areas of low-stress members and increase areas of high-stress members to balance mass and stress.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 is critical, so increasing its area might reduce stress. Members_3,4,5 have similar areas but different stresses; some can be reduced. Node_4 vertical position can be increased slightly to improve triangulation and load path. Node_3 position fixed due to load. Supports fixed. The structure is already minimal and closed. No floating nodes. History shows this is best design so far. Minor improvements possible by fine tuning node_4 and member areas.",
    
    "proposal": "Optimize current design by increasing area of member_1 to reduce max stress and slightly raising node_4 y-coordinate from 3.0 to 3.3 to improve load distribution. Reduce area of member_5 from 3 to 2 to save mass. Keep other member areas as is. This should reduce max stress below 13 and keep mass under 30.",
    
    "reasoning": "Increasing area of highly stressed member_1 reduces its stress by increasing cross-sectional area. Raising node_4 increases triangle height, improving load transfer from node_3 to supports. Reducing area of low-stress member_5 reduces mass without violating stress constraints. Triangulation is maintained, structure remains closed and stable. Supports and load nodes fixed in position as required.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate new member lengths with node_4 at (2.0, 3.3). Member lengths: m1 (node_1-node_3): 2.0m, m2 (node_3-node_2): 4.0m, m3 (node_1-node_4): sqrt(2^2 + 3.3^2)=3.84m, m4 (node_4-node_3): 3.3m, m5 (node_4-node_2): sqrt(4^2 + 3.3^2)=5.22m. Mass = sum(length * area). Assign areas: m1=3 (1.759), m2=2 (0.782), m3=3 (1.759), m4=3 (1.759), m5=2 (0.782). Calculate mass and estimate stress reduction on m1 proportional to area increase (from 0.782 to 1.759, ~2.25x area). Stress on m1 likely reduces from -13.06 to ~-5.8. Check other members stresses scale inversely with area or remain similar. Total mass approx = (2*1.759)+(4*0.782)+(3.84*1.759)+(3.3*1.759)+(5.22*0.782) = 3.518+3.128+6.75+5.81+4.08=23.29 < 30. All constraints satisfied.",
    
    "calculation": "New max stress estimated ~6 (member_1), others remain below 5 absolute. Mass 23.29 < 30. Structure closed, supports fixed, load node fixed. Node_4 repositioned to (2.00, 3.30). Member areas updated: member_1: '3', member_2: '2', member_3: '3', member_4: '3', member_5: '2'.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Design meets constraints: max stress ±20, mass <30. Improved max stress from 13.06 to ~6, reduced mass from 25.11 to 23.29. Node positions comply with fixed supports and loads. Structure remains closed and stable. No isolated nodes. Member areas optimized for stress and mass balance. Stop optimization as no further significant improvements expected.",
