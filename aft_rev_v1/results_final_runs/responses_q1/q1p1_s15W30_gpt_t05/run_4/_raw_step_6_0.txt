The current and historic structures all violate the stress constraint, typically due to under-triangulation, poor load path, or insufficient section size. The goal is to create a closed, efficient truss that resolves these violations while minimizing mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given a 4-node truss (nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), (3,2)), with a -10kN load at node_3 at -45°, pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. All prior designs exceed the stress constraint (min max|stress|=17.12, current=43.58). The structure must be closed, all nodes connected, and use only allowed area IDs. Objective: satisfy all constraints and minimize mass.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current and previous trusses fail primarily due to high stress in diagonals and verticals, especially near loaded node_3. The current design is a single triangle with an elevated node_4, but the load at node_3 is not well triangulated to supports. The historic structures either add excessive members (increasing mass) or insufficient triangulation (increasing stress). None use a Warren or Pratt-like configuration, which is optimal for such loads. The load at node_3 (2,0) is offset from the supports, making direct load transfer challenging. A better triangulated, closed truss with an additional node above node_3 and improved diagonals could distribute forces more efficiently.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: All failed structures under-triangulate or misplace diagonals. The load at node_3 is not directly supported. Adding a node above node_3 (say, node_5 at (2,1.8)) and forming a double triangle (Pratt/Warren) should reduce member stresses. Use thicker sections in high-stress members only. Avoid excess mass by not overbuilding. Ensure all nodes are included in closed loops.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign: Add a fifth node above node_3 to create a double-triangle (Warren) truss. Connect all nodes in a closed loop: node_1-node_3-node_2, node_1-node_5-node_2, node_3-node_5, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_4-node_5. Use area_id=\'2\' (A=0.782) for most members, and area_id=\'3\' (A=1.759) for the most critical diagonals. This balances mass and stress. All nodes are connected, and the structure is closed.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A Warren truss with a central node above the loaded node_3 efficiently distributes the diagonal load to both supports, minimizing peak stress. Diagonals and verticals provide alternate load paths, reducing force in any single member. Using higher area for the most loaded diagonals ensures stress stays within limits. The triangle at the top further stiffens the structure. All nodes are part of at least two triangles, ensuring closure and stability.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume: Load at node_3 (-10kN at -45°) splits into x and y: Fx = -10*cos(45°) ≈ -7.07kN, Fy = -7.07kN. Key members carrying this load are node_3-node_5, node_5-node_1, node_5-node_2. Use truss analysis (method of joints) to estimate member forces. For 2m vertical rise, diagonals ≈2.69m, base ≈2m. For area_id=\'2\' (A=0.782), allowable force = 0.782*15 ≈ 11.73kN. For area_id=\'3\' (A=1.759), allowable ≈26.39kN. Member mass = length * area. Estimate total mass: ~7-9kg, well within limit. All nodes used, all closed.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Estimate member forces: diagonals and verticals will carry most of the load, but with a double triangle, the peak force in any member should be <10kN. Use area_id=\'2\' for all but the main diagonals (node_3-node_5, node_5-node_1, node_5-node_2), which use area_id=\'3\'. Compute lengths: node_1-node_2=6.0m, node_1-node_3=2.0m, node_2-node_3=4.0m, node_3-node_5=1.8m, node_1-node_5=2.72m, node_2-node_5=4.19m, node_4 at (3.0,2.0) connects as a top chord.
