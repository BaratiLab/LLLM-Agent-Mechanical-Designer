The current and past designs violate the stress constraint, with high member stresses and inefficient load paths. The optimized structure must be fully connected and feasible.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs: Loads at node_3 (-10kN @ -45°), supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller), and four nodes at fixed locations. Current and historic structures exceed max stress constraint (|stress| up to 31), though mass is acceptable. The truss must be closed; all nodes must be interconnected for stability and efficient load transfer.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure: All nodes are connected forming a quadrilateral with diagonals. Max stress is -17.12 (member_2), exceeding the ±15 limit. Mass is 14.56, well below the 30 limit. The most stressed members are those directly on the load path from node_3 to supports (esp. node_1). The stress is concentrated in members between node_1, node_3, and node_4. Historic structures with fewer members or less triangulation show even higher stresses (up to 31). The load at node_3 (downwards and left, -45°) is not being effectively distributed to the supports. Members close to node_3 (esp. node_2↔node_3, node_1↔node_3, node_3↔node_4) are overloaded. The structure is closed, but the internal diagonals may not be optimally arranged or dimensioned for this load case.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key insight: The main stress bottleneck is in the direct members connecting the loaded node to the supports, especially node_1↔node_3. The truss needs improved triangulation and possibly increased area for the most loaded members. Adding a central node near the centroid may help distribute forces more efficiently. Alternatively, rebalancing member areas can reduce peak stress. Since mass is not a limiting factor, selective use of larger areas is justified.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss to further triangulate the structure and redistribute forces. Add a central node (node_5) at the centroid of the quadrilateral to break long spans, connect all nodes to node_5, and use larger area for the most stressed members. Retain all original node positions for supports and loads as required. This will create a double-layered triangulated truss, reducing member lengths and distributing the load more evenly.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By introducing node_5 near the centroid (approx. (3.0, 1.0)), and connecting it to all four outer nodes, the structure becomes a \'star\' with strong triangulation. This reduces the length and stress on each member. Assign larger cross-sectional areas (area_id \'3\' or \'4\') to the most loaded members (those connected to node_3), and smaller areas elsewhere to minimize mass. All nodes remain connected, the structure is closed, and the load path is optimized.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All members are pin-jointed, axial force only. Loads are static. For the new central node at (3.0, 1.0), calculate member lengths and estimate force distribution using geometry and statics. Key members (node_3↔node_5, node_5↔node_1, node_5↔node_2) will carry the main load. Use area_id \'3\' (1.759) for these, and area_id \'1\' (0.195) for less critical members. Total member mass = sum(length × area). Estimate member forces by geometry: the load at node_3 is now shared among three shorter members. Stress = force/area. Adjust area_id upwards if |stress| > 15.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node_5 at (3.0, 1.0).
