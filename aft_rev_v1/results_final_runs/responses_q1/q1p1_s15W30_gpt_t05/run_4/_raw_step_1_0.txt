The current design is over-stressed (max stress = 30.96 > 15) and needs improvement. The optimization goal is to create a feasible, efficient truss that meets all constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs show a simple quadrilateral truss with a diagonal, but the top chord is overstressed. The load is applied at node_3 (-10.0 at -45°), with supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Current member 4 (node_1-node_4) is highly stressed (+30.96). The structure is not optimally triangulated, and member areas may not be well-matched to load paths.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current truss forms a quadrilateral with a diagonal, but the load path is not efficiently distributed: the top member (node_1 to node_4) is overstressed, indicating poor force distribution and lack of redundancy. The structure is closed but not fully triangulated, making it susceptible to high local stresses. Additionally, the member areas do not reflect the actual force demands along each member. The applied load at node_3 (down and left) creates significant moment and shear, which is not effectively resisted by the current configuration. The absence of a bottom chord between node_1 and node_2 (directly connecting supports) also reduces structural efficiency.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress, the structure must be better triangulated. Adding a bottom chord (node_1 to node_2), and possibly a second diagonal (node_2 to node_4), will distribute forces more efficiently. The area assignments must be tailored: larger areas for highly loaded members, smaller for lightly loaded ones. Node positions should remain fixed for supports and load (per instruction), but node_4 can be shifted to optimize force angles.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss to a closed, double-triangle (Warren truss) configuration by: (1) adding a bottom chord between node_1 and node_2, (2) adding a diagonal from node_2 to node_4, and (3) adjusting node_4 slightly to optimize angles while keeping it close to its original position. Assign member areas based on expected force magnitude: larger area for diagonals/top chord, smaller for bottom chord.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A double-triangle (Warren) truss ensures all nodes are connected and the structure is fully triangulated, distributing loads more efficiently and reducing maximum member stress. The bottom chord (node_1 to node_2) directly connects supports and carries horizontal force components, while diagonals transfer shear. Adjusting node_4 slightly (e.g., shifting right to x=4.0, y=2.5) improves force angles and reduces member lengths, optimizing mass. Assigning larger areas to diagonals and top chord, and smaller to bottom chord, matches area to demand, minimizing mass while capping stress.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Steel, allowable stress ±15. Member force estimation via static equilibrium: load at node_3 splits into top/bottom chord and diagonals. Diagonals and top chord must resist major force; bottom chord less so. Mass = sum(length × area). Use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for diagonals/top chord, \'1\' (0.195) for bottom chord. Calculate member lengths: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(4,2.5).
