The current and historic structures all violate the stress constraint, with the current design showing max(abs(stress)) = 70.28 (>>15). The objective is to produce a closed, efficient truss that satisfies all constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs: Loads at node_3 (-10 kN at -45°), supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller), five nodes, and a closed mesh. Current/historic designs fail stress constraint (max stress up to 70), mainly in members connecting node_1 and node_3. Mass is not a limiting factor (current: 18.47 < 30). Objective: reduce member forces and stresses below 15 while keeping mass low and structure closed.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current and historic trusses use a compact, almost rectangular frame with diagonals and an internal node (node_5) for bracing, but still produce excessive stress, especially in the member from node_1 to node_3. This is likely due to insufficient triangulation and poor force redistribution: the diagonal load at node_3 is not efficiently shared among members, causing local overload. The member areas are mostly small (area_id=\'1\'), which may be insufficient for the high forces. The structure is closed, but the internal bracing is not optimal for load distribution. Historic structures with fewer nodes/members also fail the stress constraint, suggesting a need for a more robust triangulated layout or larger member areas in critical locations.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Member_2 (node_1-node_3) always fails due to high compressive force from the load at node_3. The internal node_5 helps, but its position and connections may not optimally reduce force in critical members. Increasing area here is possible, but a more efficient load path (e.g., via more triangulation or optimized node_5 position) is preferable. All nodes are already connected, so focus should be on geometry and member sizing.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the current truss by (1) repositioning internal node_5 to better intercept load paths, (2) increasing triangulation by connecting node_5 to all outer nodes (making a full K-truss), and (3) selectively increasing member areas for the most highly stressed members (especially node_1-node_3). Keep node_1, node_2, and node_3 fixed per instructions, but optimize node_4 and node_5 positions for force balance. Use area_id=\'3\' (1.759) for critical members, area_id=\'1\' (0.195) elsewhere to minimize mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A K-truss layout (with node_5 at the centroid of the quadrilateral) provides optimal triangulation and multiple load paths from node_3 to both supports, reducing force in any single member. Placing node_5 at (3.0, 1.5) (centroid-ish) will help intercept the diagonal load. Using larger cross-sections for node_1-node_3 (and possibly node_2-node_3) will keep stress below 15. All nodes remain connected, and the structure is closed. This balances mass and stress constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All members are pin-jointed truss elements. Use static equilibrium to estimate member forces. For the critical member (node_1-node_3), increase area to reduce stress (stress = force/area). For mass, sum length × area for all members. For triangulation, connect node_5 to all outer nodes. Use node_5 at (3.0, 1.5) to optimize load sharing. Set node_4 at (4.0, 2.5) as in previous designs, as this provides good height for triangulation.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Estimate member forces: The diagonal load at node_3 splits into x and y components (Fx = Fy = -10/sqrt(2) ≈ -7.07 kN each). Distribute this load via triangulated members: node_3 connects to node_1, node_2, node_4, node_5. Node_5 connects to all outer nodes. By symmetry, and with more triangulation, member forces are reduced. For the most critical member (node_1-node_3), assume force ≈ 13 kN (from previous design, but reduced by extra triangulation). With area = 1.759, stress ≈ 7.39, well below 15. Mass: For 10 members, average length ≈ 3, average area ≈ 0.8, mass ≈ 24, within constraint.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Double-check: All nodes are connected, structure is closed, no isolated nodes.
