The structure must be fully connected, efficient, and feasible.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs define a truss with 5 nodes, a diagonal load at node_3, and support at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Prior attempts failed due to excessive member stress (max |σ| = 26.2). The objective is to reduce stress below 15 and maintain mass under 30, using available area_id values.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current and historic structures exhibit high member stresses (up to 26.2) despite relatively low mass. The load at node_3 (-10.0, -45°) creates significant diagonal and vertical force components. Previous trusses have used a central node (node_5) but lacked optimal triangulation and area assignments, leading to overstressed members (notably those connecting node_3 and node_5, and node_1 to node_5). The structure must be closed and efficiently transfer the diagonal load from node_3 to the supports, while distributing forces to avoid overstressing any member.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key patterns: Overstressed members are typically in direct load path from node_3 to node_1 or node_2. Central node (node_5) is underused for triangulation. Area assignments are not always optimal—some critical members are too small. A Warren/Pratt truss configuration with well-sized diagonals should lower peak stresses. Increasing critical member areas slightly and optimizing node_5\'s position for force distribution should help.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss by repositioning node_5 upward for better triangulation, ensuring all nodes are connected, and assigning larger areas to high-stress members (especially those directly between loaded and supported nodes). Use a closed truss (all nodes connected in a triangulated frame), and set area_id to higher values for critical load-path members, while keeping others minimal for mass efficiency.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation (using a central node_5 raised above the base) will distribute the load more efficiently, reducing the force in any single member. Assigning larger cross-sections to high-stress members (those connecting node_3 to node_1, node_2, and node_5) will lower peak stress. Keeping node_1 and node_2 positions fixed (due to supports), and node_3 fixed (due to load), I will move node_5 up and slightly right for optimal geometry. Members will be connected to form triangles throughout, ensuring closure and no isolated nodes.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Area_id \'4\' (3.128) for main diagonals, \'2\' (0.782) for secondary members. All nodes must be connected. Static equilibrium: ΣF_x = 0, ΣF_y = 0 at each free node. Estimate member forces using geometry and the direction of applied load. Mass = Σ(length × area). Assign larger area to members likely to see highest forces (node_3–node_1, node_3–node_2, node_3–node_5, node_5–node_1, node_5–node_2). Node_5 placed at (3.0, 2.2) for improved force distribution.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Main load at node_3 is ~-7.07 kN (x), -7.07 kN (y). Members from node_3 to node_1 and node_2 will see highest force; assign area_id \'4\' (3.128). Node_5 is placed at (3.0, 2.2), forming a central triangle. All periphery members (node_1–node_2, node_2–node_4, etc.) use area_id \'2\' (0.782). Estimate member forces: diagonals will carry 7–10 kN, with stress = F/A = 10/3.128 ≈ 3.2 (well below 15).
