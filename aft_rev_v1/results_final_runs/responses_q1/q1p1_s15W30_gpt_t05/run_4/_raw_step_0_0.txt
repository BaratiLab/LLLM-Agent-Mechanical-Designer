The truss must be fully connected, satisfy max stress ±15, and total mass ≤30, using only specified cross-sectional areas. The goal is to optimize both geometry and member sizing for efficient load transfer and constraint satisfaction.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three nodes forming a triangle (nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0)), with node_1 pinned and node_2 roller, and a -10kN force at node_3 at -45°. The triangle is degenerate (all nodes collinear), so to form a closed truss and triangulate, at least one new node must be introduced off the x-axis. The load at node_3 suggests a need for diagonal bracing for direct force transfer. Area choices are discrete, so member sizing must be chosen for stress/mass balance.",\n    \n    "analysis": "With all original nodes collinear, a stable truss cannot be formed without adding at least one new node off the line to create a triangle. The load at node_3 (-10kN at -45°) creates both vertical and horizontal reactions; node_1 (pinned) can take both, node_2 (roller) can take only vertical. The optimal structure is likely a single triangle with node_4 above the x-axis, forming a classic truss. Diagonal bracing from node_3 to node_4 can efficiently resolve the load, minimizing member stresses. All members must be checked for stress and mass constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key insight: A single triangle (nodes 1-2-4) with node_3 connected to node_4 (forming two triangles: 1-3-4 and 2-3-4) will create a closed structure and efficiently resolve the load. The new node_4 should be placed above node_3, roughly at (2, h), with h chosen to balance member lengths and angles. Member areas will be chosen to keep stresses below 15 with minimum mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By placing node_4 at (2, 2.5), we form two triangles: (1-3-4) and (2-3-4), closing the truss and providing necessary triangulation. This position is chosen to provide a moderate height for good load path angles and to keep member lengths reasonable. All nodes are now part of a single closed structure. Members are sized to keep stress below ±15, using the smallest area possible to minimize mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume E=constant (not needed for statics). Members: (1-3), (2-3), (1-4), (2-4), (3-4). Calculate member lengths. Resolve the -10kN @ -45° load into x/y. Set up joint equilibrium at node_3 and node_4. Use method of joints to find member forces. Select area_id such that |force|/area ≤ 15 for each member. Compute mass = Σ(length × area). Iterate area choices to minimize mass while satisfying stress/mass constraints.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node_4 at (2.0, 2.5).

Using method of joints, estimate that (3-4) and (1-3) will carry the majority of load. To keep stress ≤ 15, area required for max force (say, 10kN): area ≥ 10/15 = 0.667. Closest area_id: \'2\' (0.782). Assign \'2\' to (1-3), (2-3), (3-4). For (1-4), (2-4), lower force, use area_id \'1\' (0.195).
