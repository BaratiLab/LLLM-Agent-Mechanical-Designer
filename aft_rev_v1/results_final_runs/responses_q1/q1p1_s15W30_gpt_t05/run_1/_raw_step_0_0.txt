The design must be statically determinate, triangulated for efficiency, and use only provided area options.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes are collinear along the x-axis. Node_1 (0,0) is pinned, node_2 (6,0) is a roller, node_3 (2,0) receives a 10-unit force at -45°. The structure must be closed/triangulated and all nodes must be connected. Mass and stress constraints are strict.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Collinear nodes cannot form a triangulated truss; at least one new node is required to create triangles, which efficiently resolve the off-axis load. The load at node_3 induces both x and y reactions at node_1 and node_2. The optimal solution is a triangle with a new node above the x-axis, connecting all nodes. This will ensure force distribution and structural stability. Member sizes must be chosen to keep all stresses within ±15, while minimizing mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "To close the truss and allow triangulation, insert node_4 above node_3. Place it at (2.0, 2.5) for symmetry and effective load path. Connect: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_2-node_4, node_4-node_1, node_3-node_4. This forms two triangles. The vertical height (2.5) is chosen to balance the load path and keep member lengths reasonable. Assign minimum areas where possible, increasing area for the member most directly loaded (node_3-node_4).",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation is essential for stability and stress minimization. Placing node_4 above node_3 distributes the applied load efficiently to the supports. The geometry ensures that no member is excessively long, which helps control mass. Members directly in the load path (especially node_3-node_4) are assigned larger area to keep stress below 15. All other members are assigned the smallest area that satisfies the stress constraint, to minimize mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All members are pin-jointed and only carry axial loads. Calculate member forces via static equilibrium (method of joints). Estimate member lengths using distance formula. Mass = Σ(length × area). For each member, stress = |force| / area. Key members: node_3-node_4 (takes most of the applied load), node_4-node_1 and node_4-node_2 (carry reactions to supports). Area selection is iterative: start with minimal and increase only if stress exceeds 15.",\n    \n    "calculation": "1. Member lengths: node_3-node_4: sqrt((2-2)^2 + (2.5-0)^2) = 2.5; node_4-node_1: sqrt((2-0)^2 + (2.5-0)^2) ≈ 3.20; node_4-node_2: sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-2.5)^2) ≈ 4.72; node_1-node_3: 2.0; node_3-node_2: 4.0. 2. Load at node_3: Fx = -10*cos(45°) ≈ -7.07, Fy = -7.07. By symmetry and geometry, node_3-node_4 takes much of the vertical load. Assign area_id \'3\' (1.759) to node_3-node_4. Other members get area_id \'1\' (0.195) initially. Estimate forces: node_3-node_4 ≈ 10 (main load), node_4-node_1 and node_4-node_2 ≈ 7-10 (reaction path), node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2 ≈ 3-5 (tie members). 3. Check stresses: node_3-node_4: 10/1.759 ≈ 5.7 < 15; node_4-node_1: 7/0.195 ≈ 35.9 > 15, so increase area_id to \'3\' (1.759): 7/1.759 ≈ 4.0 < 15; node_4-node_2: similar. node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2: 3/0.195 ≈ 15.4 > 15, so area_id \'2\' (0.782): 3/0.782 ≈ 3.8 < 15. 4. Mass: (2.5×1.759)+(3.20×1.759)+(4.72×1.759)+(2.0×0.782)+(4.0×0.782) ≈ (4.40)+(5.63)+(8.31)+(1.56)+(3.13)=23.03 < 30.
