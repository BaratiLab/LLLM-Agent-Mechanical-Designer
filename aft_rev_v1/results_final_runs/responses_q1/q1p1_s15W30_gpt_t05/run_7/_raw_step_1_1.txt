The current structure exceeds the allowable stress constraint (|stress| > 15) despite being under the mass limit. The optimization goal is to create a closed truss that keeps all member stresses within ±15 while minimizing mass and maintaining connectivity.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given: three supports (nodes 1, 2), one loaded node (node 3), and a fourth node (node 4) forming a quadrilateral. The current truss is a closed quadrilateral with diagonals, but member_1 is overstressed (-49.56). Mass is well below the limit (10.55 < 30). Objective: reduce stress, especially in member_1, possibly by redistributing forces or adjusting geometry.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The load at node_3 is -10 kN at -45°, which has both downward and leftward components. Node_1 (pinned at left), node_2 (roller at right), and node_3 (load applied, between them) are colinear at y=0. Node_4 is above, forming a \'trapezoidal\' truss. The current design connects all nodes, but member_1 (node_1-node_3) is highly compressed due to the geometry: node_3 is close to node_1, causing short, steeply-angled members to take high compressive force. The diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4) are present but do not sufficiently distribute the load. The stress concentration in member_1 suggests poor force distribution and/or insufficient triangulation.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key insights: The current structure\'s node_3 is too close to node_1, causing a short, steeply loaded member. Moving node_3 slightly right (closer to center) would help, but load/support positions are fixed. Adding a fifth node above node_3 (forming a \'Warren\' or \'K\' truss) could distribute the load more evenly. Alternatively, increasing the area of member_1 would reduce its stress, but the goal is to minimize mass. Improving geometry by raising node_4, or adding a node above node_3, should reduce peak stresses.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss by adding a fifth node (node_5) directly above node_3, forming a central triangle (\'fan\' or \'K\' truss). Connect node_3 to node_5, node_5 to node_1, node_5 to node_2, and node_5 to node_4. This will provide a direct load path from the loaded node to the supports and distribute the force more efficiently, reducing stress in member_1. Retain all original nodes and connections for closure, but adjust node_4 upward for better triangulation.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By adding node_5 above the loaded node_3, the vertical component of the load can be more directly resolved through triangulated paths to the supports. This reduces the force in the short, horizontal member_1 and creates multiple load paths, lowering the maximum stress. Raising node_4 to increase the height of the truss improves the angle of diagonal members, further reducing compressive forces. The structure is now a fully triangulated, closed truss (\'fan\' or \'K\' truss) with all nodes connected.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All supports and load positions are fixed. Member areas are selected to keep all stresses within ±15. The load at node_3 is -10 kN at -45° (Fx = -7.07, Fy = -7.07). Node_5 is placed at (3.0, 3.5) above node_3, node_4 at (3.0, 2.8) for optimal triangulation. Calculate member forces using static equilibrium and geometry. Assign minimum area (area_id \'1\' or \'2\') to most members, increase only if stress exceeds 15. Estimate member lengths and mass.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member layout: node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_2 (original), plus node_3-node_5, node_5-node_1, node_5-node_2, node_5-node_4. For each member, calculate length and estimate force based on geometry. For the most loaded members (likely node_3-node_5, node_5-node_1, node_5-node_2), select area_id \'2\' (0.782) or \'3\' (1.759) if needed. For diagonals and less loaded members, area_id \'1\' (0.195) suffices. Estimate maximum stress: F = 10 kN, A = 0.782 cm² → stress ≈ 12.8 < 15. Total mass: sum(length × area) for all members, keeping total < 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Final structure: five nodes, ten members.
