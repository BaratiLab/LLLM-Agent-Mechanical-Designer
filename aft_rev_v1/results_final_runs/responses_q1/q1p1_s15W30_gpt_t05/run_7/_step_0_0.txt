    "preamble": "This task is a single-shot optimization of a 2D truss using three fixed nodes, one applied load, and two supports. The objective is to minimize maximum stress while ensuring the truss is closed, all constraints are met, and mass is minimized. Cross-sectional areas must be selected from a discrete set, and the total mass must not exceed 30. Node positions for supports and loads are fixed.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given: nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0). Supports: pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Load: 10 units at node_3 at -45°. Need a closed truss (all nodes connected), minimal stress, mass < 30, stress within ±15. Only allowed to add nodes (not move existing), and must use only given area IDs.",
    
    "analysis": "With only three nodes in a line, a simple triangle between the nodes is possible, but it is not structurally optimal for a -45° load at node_3. The load will induce high axial force in the member between node_3 and the supports. To improve load distribution and close the structure, a fourth node above the x-axis can provide triangulation and reduce member forces. Placing this node at a position forming two roughly equilateral triangles with the supports and loaded node will help distribute stresses efficiently. Members should be sized to keep stress within ±15, and mass must be checked.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Key insight: Direct load path from node_3 to supports is needed, but triangulation is essential to avoid excessive force in a single member. Adding one node above (e.g., near (3,2.5)) allows for two triangles, distributing the load. All members must be connected to form a closed structure. Member area selection will focus on stress limits and mass minimization.",
    
    "reasoning": "By adding node_4 at (3.0, 2.5), the structure forms two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4). This configuration efficiently transfers the load at node_3 to both supports, reducing the force in each member. Members connecting all nodes ensure closure. The areas are chosen to just satisfy stress limits, using the smallest possible area for each member that keeps stress below ±15 and total mass under 30.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All members are pin-jointed, loads are static, material is homogeneous. For each member, calculate length, estimate axial force via static equilibrium (using geometry and symmetry), then compute stress = force/area. Iterate area selection upward until max stress <15. Mass = sum(length × area). Members: (node_1-node_3), (node_2-node_3), (node_1-node_4), (node_2-node_4), (node_3-node_4), (node_1-node_2).",
    
    "calculation": "Geometry: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (3,2.5). Member lengths: node_1-node_3: 2.0, node_2-node_3: 4.0, node_1-node_4: sqrt(3^2+2.5^2)=3.91, node_2-node_4: sqrt(3^2+2.5^2)=3.91, node_3-node_4: sqrt(1^2+2.5^2)=2.69, node_1-node_2: 6.0. Load at node_3 resolved to (Fx,Fy)=(-7.07,-7.07). By symmetry, with triangulation, max member force ≈ 7.07/sin(θ), θ=arctan(2.5/1)=68.20°, sin(68.20°)=0.927. So, max force ≈ 7.07/0.927=7.63. Stress = 7.63/area. To keep stress <15, area > 0.509. Use area_id '2' (0.782) for members carrying high load (node_3-node_4, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4), area_id '1' (0.195) for less loaded members (node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_2). Mass = sum(length × area): (2×0.195)+(4×0.195)+(3.91×0.782)+(3.91×0.782)+(2.69×0.782)+(6×0.195) = 0.39+0.78+3.06+3.06+2.10+1.17 = 10.56 < 30. All constraints satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Design adds node_4 at (3.0,2.5) for triangulation, uses area_id '2' (0.782) for high-force members, area_id '1' (0.195) for others. Structure is closed, all nodes connected, total mass well below 30, max stress <15. No duplicate members or nodes. All design choices justified by load path and stress analysis.",
