The objective is to design a triangulated, fully connected truss with optimal member sizing and configuration, ensuring maximum stress is within ±15 and total mass ≤ 30 units.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three collinear nodes, with supports at (0,0) and (6,0), and a diagonal load at (2,0). The structure must be closed/triangulated. With only three nodes, a triangle is the simplest closed truss, but all are on the x-axis, which is structurally weak for vertical/shear loads. Introducing a new node above the x-axis will enable triangulation and effective load transfer.",\n\n    "analysis": "The load (-10 @ -45°) at node_3 induces both horizontal and vertical reactions at the supports. With only the three given nodes, the truss would be a line, unable to resist out-of-plane loads. To create a stable, triangulated structure, a new node is needed above the x-axis. Connecting all nodes forms two triangles, distributing the load efficiently. The supports (pinned at node_1, roller at node_2) provide stability. Member areas must be chosen to keep stress ≤15, and total mass ≤30. The primary load path is from node_3 to the supports, ideally via the new node.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a node above (e.g., at (3,2.5)) allows for a symmetric, efficient triangulation. Members from node_3 to the new node, and from both supports to the new node, complete the closure. The load at node_3 is best resisted by a diagonal member to the new node, which then transfers forces to supports. Members should be sized for the highest force, likely in the diagonals due to the oblique load. The base members will see less force.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Triangulation is essential for stability and to minimize stress. Placing the new node symmetrically above the midpoint (between node_1 and node_2) ensures even load distribution and efficient geometry. Each member is sized based on estimated force demand: diagonals (carrying the direct load) get larger areas, while the base members (less force) get smaller areas. This approach minimizes mass while controlling stress.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Material strength supports max stress ±15; all joints are pin-connected; areas from area_id. Calculations: (1) Determine geometry: new node at (3.0, 2.5). (2) List members: base (node_1-node_2), diagonals (node_1-new, node_2-new), and vertical (node_3-new). (3) Calculate member lengths. (4) Estimate forces using method of joints (node_3 equilibrium: force in diagonal ≈ load/√2). (5) Assign area_id to keep stress ≤15. (6) Compute mass = Σ(length × area).",\n\n    "calculation": "Geometry: new node_4 at (3.0, 2.5). Member lengths: node_1-node_2: 6.0; node_1-node_4: sqrt(3^2+2.5^2)=3.91; node_2-node_4: same=3.91; node_3-node_4: sqrt(1^2+2.5^2)=2.69; node_1-node_3: 2.0; node_2-node_3: 4.0. Method of joints: Load at node_3 splits into members node_3-node_4 and node_3-node_1/node_3-node_2. Diagonal member (node_3-node_4) carries most of the load: F ≈ 10/sin(atan(2.5/1)) ≈ 10/0.93 ≈ 10.75. Stress = F/area. To keep stress ≤15, area ≥ 10.75/15 ≈ 0.72. Use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for diagonal. Base members (node_1-node_2, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3): area_id \'1\' (0.195). Diagonals from supports to node_4: area_id \'2\' (0.782). Mass: (6.0×0.195)+(2.0×0.195)+(4.0×0.195)+(3.91×0.782)+(3.91×0.782)+(2.69×0.782) = 1.17+0.39+0.78+3.06+3.06+2.10 = 10.56 < 30.
