The current and prior designs violate the max stress constraint (|stress| ≤ 15) and have varying mass efficiency. The objective is to generate a closed truss that minimizes maximum member stress and total mass, while strictly satisfying all constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The goal is to design a minimal-mass, constraint-satisfying truss. Constraints: |stress| ≤ 15, mass ≤ 30. The current and historical structures show overstressed members, especially in the bottom chord and diagonals. The load is applied at node_3 (-10, -45°), supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Node and area choices must be judicious.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current and historic designs often have the bottom chord overstressed, especially between node_3 (load) and supports. Diagonal and vertical members are often too slender or too short, failing to distribute load effectively. Many designs are overbuilt (high mass) or have insufficient triangulation. The load at node_3 (between supports) creates high bending and shear, so efficient triangulation and direct load paths are essential. The current design has member_7 at -21.54 (overstressed), and other members near the limit. Reducing member length, increasing triangulation, and using larger area members in critical regions will help. The history shows that increasing member areas alone increases mass without solving overstress, so geometry must be improved.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Overstressed bottom chord/diagonals, poor load path, insufficient triangulation. Insights: Move upper nodes higher and closer to load, create a more direct load path via steeper diagonals, and use a Warren truss configuration for force distribution. Avoid excessive area increase; instead, optimize geometry.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss: Retain supports and load node positions, but reposition upper nodes for better triangulation. Use a Warren (alternating diagonal) truss, with a central top node above the load for direct force transfer. Connect all nodes for closure, use larger area for high-stress members, and minimize member length. This will reduce stress concentrations and mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A Warren truss or Pratt truss efficiently distributes loads with minimal member force. Placing an upper node above node_3 (load) creates a direct vertical load path, reducing bending in the bottom chord. Shorter, steeper diagonals lower member forces. Use minimal area for non-critical members, and increase area only for high-stress members. All nodes must be connected for closure.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Steel material, linear elastic, static load. Set up nodes: node_1 (0,0) pinned, node_2 (6,0) roller, node_3 (2,0) loaded. Add node_4 (4,0) as bottom chord, node_5 (3,2.8) as top node above midspan. Member layout: bottom chord (node_1-node_3-node_4-node_2), diagonals (node_1-node_5, node_3-node_5, node_4-node_5, node_2-node_5). Use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for bottom chord, \'1\' (0.195) for diagonals unless stress requires more. Calculate member lengths, estimate forces using method of joints, and check stress/mass.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node positions: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (4,0), node_5 (3,2.8).

Estimate force in bottom chord (worst case): F = load/2 ≈ 7.07, so stress = F/area. For area_id \'2\', area=0.782, stress ≈ 9.05 (safe). Diagonals will have lower forces. Total mass = sum(length × area) = (2+2+2)×0.782 + (4.09+2.97+2.97+4.09)×0.195 = 4.692 + 2.803 = 7.495 < 30.
