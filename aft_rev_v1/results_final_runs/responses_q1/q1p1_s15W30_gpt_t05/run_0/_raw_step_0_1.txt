The objective is to minimize member stress while ensuring all stresses are within ±15 and the total mass does not exceed 30. All nodes must be connected in a closed structure, and the design must be efficient and physically meaningful.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "We have three nodes: node_1 (pinned at (0,0)), node_2 (roller at (6,0)), and node_3 (free at (2,0)). A downward-leftward load (-10 at 45°) acts on node_3. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) allow for horizontal and vertical reaction resolution. The structure must be closed (triangle) and optimized for mass and stress.",\n    \n    "analysis": "With only three nodes, the only possible closed truss is a triangle. Members: (node_1, node_2), (node_2, node_3), (node_3, node_1). The load at node_3 will induce tension/compression in all members. The most critical member will be the one(s) most aligned with the load direction. The truss must be statically determinate. Given the short spans and high load, the smallest cross-sections may not suffice to keep stresses under 15. The mass constraint is likely not active due to the small structure size.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The triangle is the only closed configuration. All members must be sized to keep max stress ≤ 15. The load at node_3 distributes via the triangle to the supports. By symmetry, node_1 and node_2 are at y=0, node_3 at (2,0). However, node_3 is collinear; this is a degenerate triangle, so to form a true triangle, a new node off the x-axis is needed. However, instructions say not to move load/support nodes, but new nodes may be added. Best to add a node above or below the x-axis to form a stable triangle.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "To create a true closed truss and maintain triangulation, add a new node (node_4) above the x-axis (e.g., at (2.0, 2.0)). This creates two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4), (node_2, node_3, node_4), and a base (node_1, node_2). This distributes the load at node_3 more efficiently, shortens member lengths, and reduces peak stresses. Select cross-sectional areas to keep all member stresses ≤ 15, using the smallest possible area IDs to minimize mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: E = 1 (unitless), all loads in kN, areas in cm², lengths in m. Members: (node_1, node_3), (node_2, node_3), (node_1, node_2), (node_3, node_4), (node_1, node_4), (node_2, node_4). For each member, calculate length, estimate member force via static equilibrium (joint method), compute stress = force/area, and sum mass = Σ(length × area). Start with area_id \'2\' (0.782) for diagonals and area_id \'0\' (1.0) for base; increase if stress exceeds 15.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node positions: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (2,2). Members: (node_1, node_2): length 6.0m; (node_1, node_3): 2.0m; (node_2, node_3): 4.0m; (node_3, node_4): 2.0m; (node_1, node_4): sqrt(8)=2.83m; (node_2, node_4): sqrt(20)=4.47m. Estimate load path: the vertical component of the load at node_3 is -7.07kN, horizontal is -7.07kN. The load will be shared by (node_3, node_4), (node_3, node_1), and (node_3, node_2). Members to node_4 carry vertical/shear; base carries horizontal. Assign area_id \'3\' (1.759) to (node_3, node_4) and diagonals, \'2\' (0.782) to shorter members. Compute stresses: for a 10kN load split between three members, each member sees up to 7.1kN; stress = 7.1/1.759 = 4.04 < 15. Mass: (6.0×1.0)+(2.0×0.782)+(4.0×0.782)+(2.0×1.759)+(2.83×1.759)+(4.47×1.759)=6.0+1.56+3.13+3.52+4.98+7.86=27.05 < 30.
