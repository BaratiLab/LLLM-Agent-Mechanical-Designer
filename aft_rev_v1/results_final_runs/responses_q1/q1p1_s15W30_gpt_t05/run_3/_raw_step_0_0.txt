All design constraints (stress ≤ 15, mass ≤ 30, full connectivity) must be strictly satisfied.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three collinear nodes, with node_3 between node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). The only load is at node_3, acting diagonally downward. The objective is to create a closed, triangulated truss with minimal mass and stress, possibly by introducing a new node above the base to form a triangle, distributing the load efficiently.",\n\n    "analysis": "The three nodes are collinear along the x-axis. A diagonal load at node_3 will induce high bending if only the base is used. To ensure a stable, efficient truss, a triangle (by adding a node above the base) is optimal. The base will resist horizontal and vertical reactions, while the top node will help distribute the load via direct axial paths. Triangulation is key for both stability and stress minimization. All supports and loads must remain fixed.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a node above the x-axis (say, at the centroid or above node_3) will allow two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4). This will provide direct load paths and reduce bending. The truss must be fully closed, so all nodes must be interconnected, forming a quadrilateral with a diagonal (i.e., two triangles). Member areas must be selected to keep all member stresses ≤ 15 and total mass ≤ 30.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Introduce node_4 at (3.0, 2.0) above the base, centered horizontally for symmetry and direct load transfer. Connect all base nodes to node_4 and to each other, forming a closed quadrilateral with diagonals, i.e., full triangulation. Choose minimal area_ids for short members, and larger ones for high-force members (e.g., those along the load path). This layout minimizes both stress and mass.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume all members are pin-jointed. Calculate member lengths: base (node_1-node_2): 6.0, node_1-node_3: 2.0, node_2-node_3: 4.0, node_1-node_4: sqrt(13), node_2-node_4: sqrt(13), node_3-node_4: 2.0. Assign area_id based on estimated force: members along the direct load path (node_3-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_4-node_1) may require larger areas. Assume load at node_3 splits between node_3-node_4 and node_3-node_1/node_3-node_2. Calculate forces using static equilibrium and geometry. Mass = sum(length × area). Assign lowest possible area_ids that keep all member stresses ≤ 15.",\n\n    "calculation": "Key member lengths: node_1-node_2: 6.0, node_1-node_3: 2.0, node_2-node_3: 4.0, node_1-node_4: 3.61, node_2-node_4: 3.61, node_3-node_4: 2.0. Load at node_3 (-10, -45°) splits along node_3-node_4 and base. Assume node_3-node_4 takes majority (since it\'s aligned with the load direction). Estimate force in node_3-node_4 ≈ 10 kN. For area_id \'3\' (1.759), stress = 10/1.759 ≈ 5.68 < 15. For other members, use area_id \'1\' (0.195) where possible, as their forces are smaller. Total mass = 6.0×0.195 + 2.0×0.195 + 4.0×0.195 + 3.61×0.195×2 + 2.0×1.759 ≈ 1.17 + 0.39 + 0.78 + 1.41 + 3.52 = 7.27 (well under mass constraint).
