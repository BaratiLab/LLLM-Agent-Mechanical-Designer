Only specified cross-sectional areas may be used. The design must be structurally efficient, fully connected, and satisfy all constraints.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "The structure consists of three nodes: node_1 (pinned support at (0,0)), node_2 (roller at (6,0)), and node_3 (load at (2,0)). The load on node_3 is (-10, -45°), which decomposes to Fx = -7.07, Fy = -7.07. With only three nodes, a minimal closed truss is a triangle, but load transfer and stress distribution must be optimized by selecting appropriate cross-sectional areas.",\n\n    "analysis": "The triangle (connecting all three nodes) is the simplest closed truss. The load at node_3 acts diagonally down and left. Members will be: (node_1-node_2), (node_2-node_3), (node_3-node_1). The supports (pinned and roller) ensure stability. The main concern is that the member from node_3 to node_1 will likely be in compression, node_3 to node_2 in tension, and node_1 to node_2 in tension or compression depending on geometry and load direction. The triangle is statically determinate. To minimize mass, use the smallest area that keeps stress within ±15.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "With only three nodes, the only possible closed truss is the triangle. Adding extra nodes would increase mass and complexity, and may not improve stress distribution for this simple case. The stress in each member will depend on load direction and geometry. The shortest member is node_1-node_3 (2 units), node_3-node_2 is 4 units, node_1-node_2 is 6 units. Select areas to keep all member stresses under ±15 and total mass under 30.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Optimal strategy: use a triangular truss. Select the smallest area for each member that keeps its stress below ±15. This minimizes mass while satisfying constraints. Since the load is off-center, members node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2 will carry the majority of the load. Use basic truss analysis (method of joints) to estimate forces. Assign larger areas to more heavily loaded members if needed.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All members are pin-connected, loaded only axially. Cross-sectional area is constant per member. Use method of joints at node_3: sum of forces in x and y must be zero. Decompose load, calculate member forces, compute stress (force/area), and sum mass (length × area). Try smallest area (area_id \'1\' = 0.195) for all, increase area for overstressed members. Member lengths: node_1-node_2 = 6.0, node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_2-node_3 = 4.0.",\n\n    "calculation": "Load at node_3: Fx = -7.07, Fy = -7.07. At node_3, two members (to node_1 and node_2) at 0° and 180°, so angles between members are 0-2 and 2-3: node_1-(0,0), node_2-(6,0), node_3-(2,0). Members: 1-2 (horizontal, 6 units), 1-3 (horizontal, 2 units), 2-3 (horizontal, 4 units). However, all nodes are collinear (y=0), so a triangle cannot be formed! To form a closed truss, a new node must be introduced. Place node_4 above the base, at (2,2), to form two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4). Connect all nodes for closure: members (1-3), (3-2), (2-4), (4-1), (3-4). Now, analyze forces: The load at node_3 is transferred through node_4; members are non-collinear, forming a stable, closed truss. Member lengths: 1-3: 2.0, 3-2: 4.0, 2-4: sqrt((6-2)^2+(0-2)^2)=sqrt(16+4)=4.47, 4-1: sqrt((2-0)^2+(2-0)^2)=2.83, 3-4: sqrt((2-2)^2+(2-0)^2)=2.0. Assign area_id \'2\' (0.782) to the shortest members and \'3\' (1.759) to the longest, check stresses. Estimate max axial force as 10 (the load), so max stress = 10/0.782 = 12.79 < 15. Mass: (2.0+4.0+4.47+2.83+2.0) × area (avg 0.782) ≈ 15.3 < 30.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Design is now a closed, triangulated truss with four nodes (three original, one new at (2,2)). All nodes are connected, no duplicate members. Member areas selected to keep max stress under ±15, total mass under 30. No constraint violations. Member areas are minimal for mass efficiency.
