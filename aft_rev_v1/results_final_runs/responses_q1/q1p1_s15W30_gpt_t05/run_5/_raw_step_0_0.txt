The truss must satisfy strict stress (±15) and mass (≤30) constraints, using only allowed cross-sectional areas. The objective is to design a triangulated, fully connected structure with optimal load path and minimal member mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes are given: two at (0,0) and (6,0) (supports), and one at (2,0) (loaded). The load is -10 kN at -45°, which produces both downward and leftward force. To create a closed, triangulated truss, at least one new node must be added above the x-axis. The supports are at the base, so a triangle above is ideal for direct load transfer and minimal member length.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The load at node_3 is both vertical and horizontal, requiring a structure that can resolve both. A single triangle with a new node above the base (e.g., at (3,2.5)) allows efficient force distribution. All three base nodes are connected, but without an upper node, the truss would be a straight line and not closed. The load path should flow from node_3 up to the new node, then down to both supports, forming two triangles. This layout minimizes member lengths and distributes forces efficiently. Possible failure modes: buckling (compression), tension failure, or exceeding mass constraint. The area selection must be balanced to keep stresses below ±15 while maintaining mass ≤30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "A single upper node (node_4) placed symmetrically above the base will close the truss and create two triangles. This is the minimum triangulated form for three base nodes. The load at node_3 will transfer to node_4 and then to both supports. The most critical members will be those directly connected to the loaded node. The upper node should be placed as low as possible to minimize member length, but high enough to improve force resolution and reduce stress in the horizontal members.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Optimal triangulation is achieved by adding node_4 at (3.0, 2.5) (midpoint above base, height chosen to balance member length and force angles). This forms two triangles: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_3-node_2-node_4. All nodes are now part of a single, closed structure. Members are: (node_1, node_3), (node_3, node_2), (node_2, node_4), (node_4, node_1), (node_3, node_4). Member areas are chosen by estimating force magnitudes (based on geometry and load direction), then selecting the smallest area that keeps |stress| ≤ 15, while ensuring total mass ≤ 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Steel-like material, unit density for mass calculation. Forces are distributed via static equilibrium. Member lengths calculated by distance formula. For area selection: stress = force / area, area in units from area_id. Mass = sum(length × area). For each member, estimate force using truss method of joints (approximate, as load is off-center). Assign larger area to members directly loaded (node_3-node_4, node_3-node_1, node_3-node_2), smaller area for diagonals. Start with area_id \'2\' (0.782) for diagonals, \'4\' (3.128) for loaded members, adjust if mass > 30.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_2 = 4.0, node_1-node_4 = sqrt((3)^2 + (2.5)^2) ≈ 3.91, node_2-node_4 = sqrt((3)^2 + (2.5)^2) ≈ 3.91, node_3-node_4 = sqrt((1)^2 + (2.5)^2) ≈ 2.69. Assign area_id: node_1-node_3 (\'2\'), node_3-node_2 (\'2\'), node_1-node_4 (\'1\'), node_2-node_4 (\'1\'), node_3-node_4 (\'4\'). Masses: (2.0×0.782)+(4.0×0.782)+(3.91×0.195)+(3.91×0.195)+(2.69×3.128) ≈ 1.56+3.13+0.76+0.76+8.41 = 14.62. Well below mass constraint. Now, estimate max force in node_3-node_4 (critical): load is 10 kN at -45°, so F ≈ 10/sin(θ), θ ≈ 68° (angle between node_3-node_4 and horizontal), sin(68°)=0.927, so F ≈ 10.8 kN. Stress = 10.8/3.128 ≈ 3.45 < 15. All other members see lower forces due to triangulation.
