No prior design exists; this is a single-shot optimal solution.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given: nodes at (0.0, 0.0), (6.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0); load at node_3 (-10 kN @ -45°); node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Objective: closed truss, minimum stress, mass ≤30, |σ|≤15. Need to triangulate for stability and efficient load transfer.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Three nodes are colinear along x=0, 2, 6. Load is at node_3 (2,0), which is between supports. A simple triangle (all nodes connected) is the minimal closed truss. However, all members in a line are not stable; so, add a new node above the current line to form a triangle. Placing node_4 at (2.0, 2.0) above node_3 creates two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4). This allows for triangulation, direct load path, and reduced member forces. All nodes are connected; structure is closed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation is essential for stability. New node_4 at (2.0, 2.0) enables efficient load transfer from node_3 upwards, reducing member forces compared to a flat truss. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4. All nodes are in a single closed structure. Next, select minimum areas that keep stress ≤15 and total mass ≤30.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulated truss with node_4 above node_3 gives direct load path and stability. Members are chosen to form two triangles sharing the loaded node. Use smallest possible area_id for each member, checking stress and mass limits. Increase area where stress would exceed 15. Symmetry about x=2.0 ensures balanced force distribution.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume: load at node_3 is -10 kN at -45° (Fx=Fy= -7.07 kN). Set up equilibrium: sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, moments=0. Calculate member forces using method of joints. Estimate member lengths: node_1-node_3 (2.0), node_3-node_2 (4.0), node_1-node_4 (sqrt(2^2+2^2)=2.83), node_2-node_4 (sqrt(4^2+2^2)=4.47), node_3-node_4 (2.0). Try area_id \'1\' (0.195) for all; if stress >15, increase area. Compute mass: sum(length × area).",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3: 2.0, node_3-node_2: 4.0, node_1-node_4: 2.83, node_2-node_4: 4.47, node_3-node_4: 2.0. Start with area_id \'1\' (0.195): total mass = (2.0+4.0+2.83+4.47+2.0)×0.195 = 15.3×0.195 ≈ 2.99 < 30. Now, estimate forces at node_3: vertical and horizontal load of -7.07 kN. By symmetry, node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2 share horizontal load, node_3-node_4 takes vertical. For worst-case, assume max force on node_3-node_4: F = 7.07 kN. Stress = 7.07/0.195 ≈ 36.2 > 15. So, increase area for node_3-node_4 to area_id \'3\' (1.759): stress = 7.07/1.759 ≈ 4.02 < 15. Recompute mass: node_3-node_4: 2.0×1.759=3.52; others: (2.0+4.0+2.83+4.47)×0.195=2.62.
