    "preamble": "The task is to generate an optimized, closed 2D truss structure with five nodes (three fixed, two free), subject to a single diagonal load at node_3, and supported at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). The objective is to minimize stress and mass, ensuring all member stresses are ≤ ±15 and total mass ≤ 30, using only allowed cross-sectional areas. Previous designs violate the stress constraint or are inefficient in mass.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given: node_1 and node_2 are supports, node_3 receives a (-10, -45°) load, node_4 and node_5 are free. Current and historic designs either exceed max stress (|stress|>15) or are too heavy. The best historic (rank_1) structure has max stress 12.82 and mass 17.01, both within constraints.",
    
    "analysis": "The load at node_3 is large and diagonal, requiring efficient triangulation to distribute forces. The best historic structure (rank_1) uses a symmetric, triangulated layout with node_4 and node_5 positioned above the base, forming two triangles. All nodes are well connected, and all members are utilized (no isolated nodes). The current design's stress exceeds the limit (17.68 > 15), and several other variants are either too light (overstressed) or too heavy (inefficient). The historic rank_1 design is the only one that satisfies all constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: All constraint-satisfying structures are triangulated, with node_4 and node_5 above the base. Overly tall or wide node placements increase member forces. Using area_id '2' (0.782) for bottom members and verticals, and '1' (0.195) for diagonals, strikes a balance between mass and stress. The historic rank_1 structure is optimal and feasible.",
    
    "proposal": "Reuse the historic rank_1 structure, as it is closed, fully connected, satisfies all constraints, and is efficient. No further optimization is likely to yield a better result within the given constraints and area options.",
    
    "reasoning": "Triangulation ensures stability and low member forces. Keeping node_4 and node_5 above and near the loaded node_3 provides direct load paths to supports. Using slightly larger areas for the heavily loaded bottom members and smaller areas for less loaded diagonals minimizes mass while keeping stress below the limit. The layout is symmetric, which helps distribute the diagonal load efficiently and prevents local overstress.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All supports and loads remain fixed. Use area_id '2' (0.782) for the base and key diagonals, area_id '1' (0.195) for other diagonals. Node positions: node_1 at (0,0), node_2 at (6,0), node_3 at (2,0) (fixed), node_4 at (3.0,2.8), node_5 at (2.0,4.2). All nodes are connected, forming a closed truss. Mass is sum of member lengths × area, all < 30. Max stress from FEM is 12.82 < 15.",
    
    "calculation": "Historic FEM results: max(abs(stress)) = 12.82 (member_1), total mass = 17.0061. All member stresses are within ±15. All nodes are connected. All member areas are from allowed area_id set. Mass is well below 30. Thus, all constraints are satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "The historic rank_1 structure is fully compliant, efficient, and optimal. No further changes needed. All nodes are connected, all constraints are met, and the structure is closed. Ready to output.",
