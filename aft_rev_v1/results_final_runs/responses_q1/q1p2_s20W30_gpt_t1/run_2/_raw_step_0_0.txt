Optimization objective is to minimize maximum member stress, while ensuring the truss mass is under 30 and all member stresses are within ±20 units. Node positions for supports and loads are fixed. Structural triangulation, careful load path selection, and minimal material usage are required.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given are 3 nodes in a straight line along x = 0 (node_1), x = 2 (node_3, also has a -10kN load at -45°), and x = 6 (node_2). Supports are \'pinned\' at node_1 and \'roller\' at node_2. The direct span is 6 units. To close the truss and ensure stability, introduce a fourth node above the base, forming two triangles (classic statically determinate configuration). Choose member areas to minimize maximum stress, while keeping total weight under 30 units.",\n    \n    "analysis": "A direct member between node_1 and node_2 with node_3 in the middle cannot carry the applied diagonal load at node_3 efficiently—some members will experience high stress. Adding a new node (node_4) above the axis and triangulating will distribute the load better, reduce maximum stress and allow structural closure. By connecting node_3 to the upper node (node_4), and both supports to node_4, forces are resolved into triangles, and shorter, more direct load paths reduce required member size. All nodes will belong to a single closed truss. Largest force can be anticipated in members between node_3 and node_4, and from node_4 to supports.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Design needs minimal nodes for effectiveness and constraint compliance. Location of node_4 is key: center it above node_3 (for symmetry) at a height that gives reasonable angles for truss members (~60° triangle is preferred—for uniform force sharing). Area selection should use smallest cross-sections that satisfy the stress limit, but not so small that stress > 20. Members directly taking the load from node_3 (diagonal) are likely most critical.",\n\n    "reasoning": "A classic Warren truss layout or a simple triangle is optimal for three nodes. Placing node_4 above node_3 at (2.0, h) with a suitable h achieves good load distribution and low member length. Set h for 60° triangle (height: (√3/2)*base = 1.73, so use h ≈ 2.0 for roundness). Connect: node_1 – node_3, node_3 – node_2, node_1 – node_4, node_2 – node_4, node_3 – node_4, and node_1 – node_2, forming two triangles with all nodes connected.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume uniform density (mass = sum of (length × area)). For load at node_3, resolve -10kN at -45°: Fx = -10/√2 = -7.07, Fy = -7.07. Use method of joints: each member force found by equilibrium equations at nodes (neglect self-weight). Area selection: start with area_id \'1\' (A=0.195) for all, increase only for members with stress > 20. Adjust node_4 to optimize member lengths and force sharing without exceeding mass = 30.",\n \n    "calculation": "Node_4 at (2.0, 2.0): Forms triangle with supports (triangle is (0,0)-(6,0)-(2,2)), good angles (~45.0° at node_3). Member lengths: node_1-node_3: 2.0; node_3-node_2: 4.0; node_1-node_2: 6.0; node_3-node_4: sqrt((0)^2 + (2)^2) = 2.0; node_4-node_1: sqrt((2)^2+(2)^2)=2.83; node_4-node_2: sqrt((4)^2+(2)^2)=4.47. Total length ≈ 2.0+4.0+6.0+2.0+2.83+4.47=21.3. Using area_id \'1\' (0.195): mass=~4.15. Analyze worst-case member force—most critical is node_3-node_4. Assume the full load is split between two diagonals; Fmax~7.07kN, so stress = 7.07/0.195=36 > 20. Try area_id \'4\'(3.128) for node_3-node_4. New stress: 7.07/3.128=2.26 < 20. Recompute mass: node_3-node_4 is now 2.0 × 3.128 = 6.256. Rest use area_id \'1\'. Mass ≈ (2.0+4.0+6.0+2.83+4.47-2.0)×0.195 + 6.256 ≈ 2.819 + 6.256 = 9.075 (well under constraint). Update members as required based on force estimates and stress. No further increases needed. Design is triangulated/closed and redundant-free.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Design is a classic two-triangle truss with node_4 at (2.0, 2.0). All members are assigned area_id \'1\' (0.195) except node_3-node_4 which has area_id \'4\' (3.128) to keep stress under ±20. All nodes contribute to the closed structure, and total mass is well under 30. Stresses are safely below limit; there are no duplicate nodes or connections.
