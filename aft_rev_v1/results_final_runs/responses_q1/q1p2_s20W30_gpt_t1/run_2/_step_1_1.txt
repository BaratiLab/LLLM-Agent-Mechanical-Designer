    "preamble": "A 2D truss with 4 nodes is analyzed to resist a single inclined load at node_3. The current design violates the max stress constraint (±20 limit) and has room for optimization in weight. Objective: Generate a closed, constraint-satisfying truss while minimizing stress and total mass. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller); node positions with loads/supports are fixed.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: minimize max(abs(stress)) and mass, both under strict upper bounds. The current structure (max_stress ≈ 42.3, mass ≈ 10.0) is over-stressed. Area assignments show that only member_6 has a larger area, others are minimal (area_id '1'). Triangulation exists, but force distribution is uneven.",
    
    "analysis": "The current truss forms a rectangular base (nodes 1,3,2), with node_4 above node_3 and centrally between supports. The left (node_1) and right (node_2) are directly supported, while node_3 (loaded) and node_4 (apex) form the upper triangle. The largest compressive/tensile stresses are in member_1 and member_4, both of which are inadequately sized for their force. The structure is close to optimal geometry (Warren/Howe truss), but area allocation is inefficient. The history shows that current topology leads to large member stresses due to concentrated load and over-reliance on slender members to transfer force at node_3.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Pattern: Vertically compact trusses spread load more efficiently. Member_1 (node_1-node_3) takes excessive compressive stress. The area list permits larger areas—redistributing cross-sections to high-stress members can help. The structure is closed but needs improved triangulation near load node. Adding a diagonal from support (node_1 or node_2) to apex (node_4) can help distribute force.",
    
    "proposal": "Redesign the truss using a slightly taller and more symmetrical configuration. Fix nodes 1, 2 (supports) and 3 (load), but shift node_4 as an apex above node_3 to form a steeper triangle, improving force paths. Add a fifth node (node_5) offset above the centerline to further triangulate and relieve members near node_3. Select larger area_ids for members bearing peak stress. All nodes will be structurally connected to ensure closed-ness.",
    
    "reasoning": "A steeper top chord (raise apex higher) reduces horizontal member force and allows diagonals to carry more of the load. Employing a double-apex layout with an additional node distributes applied load between two impressive triangles. Strategically choosing large area_ids for critical diagonals and top chords, minimum for low-stress members, keeps mass within constraints. All supports and loads remain unmoved, fulfilling input requirements.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Uniform material. Load at node_3 is -10kN at -45° (down-and-right). Node_1 (0,0) is pinned; node_2 (6,0) is roller. Fix node_3 at (2,0). Move apex (node_4) further up, say (2,2.5). Add node_5 at (4,2.0) to further triangulate the top. Connect: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_4-node_5 for closed network. Assign area_ids: use '4' for high-force members, '1' for lightly loaded, subject to iteration for mass/stress. Calculate each member's length and rough force estimate using geometry and equilibrium.",
    
    "calculation": "Geometry: node_4 = (2.0,2.5); node_5 = (4.0,2.0). Members: 1-3, 3-2, 1-4, 4-2, 3-4, 3-5, 5-2, 4-5. Lengths (approx): 1-3 = 2.0m, 3-2 = 4.0m, 1-4 = sqrt((2)^2+(2.5)^2)=3.2m, 4-2 = sqrt((4)^2+(2.5)^2)=4.72m, 3-4 = 2.5m, 3-5 = sqrt((2)^2+(2.0)^2)=2.83m, 5-2 = sqrt((2)^2+(2.0)^2)=2.83m, 4-5 = 2.0m. Assign area_id '4' (3.128) to high-force diagonals (1-4, 3-4, 3-5, 4-2), area_id '1' elsewhere. Trial sum: 3.2*3.128 + 2.5*3.128 +2.83*3.128 +4.72*3.128 ≈ 38.8 (over limit); try area_id '2' (~0.78): 3.2*0.782 + ... If too low, try '3' (1.76). Pick area_id '3' for key diagonals, '1' elsewhere. Sum mass: (3.2+2.5+2.83+4.72)*1.759 ≈ 23.03; add remainder (short, low-stress): 2.0+2.0+2.0+4.0 ≈ 10m * 0.195 = 1.95; total ≈ 25kg, within constraint. Stress will scale inversely with area, and triangles will distribute force, making max|stress| < 20 plausible.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Design is now a trapezoidal truss with an extra top node for redundancy and proper triangulation. Area assignments ensure no member will exceed the ±20 stress constraint if the member's loads distribute as anticipated. All nodes are connected and no unsupported or floating nodes exist. Mass is conservatively below 30. Node positions are precise floats. Confirm all requirements before returning final structure.",
