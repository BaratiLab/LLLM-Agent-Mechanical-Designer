Previous designs exceeded the mass constraint or had stress violations. The objective is to generate a closed (fully triangulated) truss satisfying all constraints with minimum stress and mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Current structure is slightly over-stressed in one member and far exceeds total mass constraint (40.8 > 30). A previous lighter structure violated stress. Need to balance increased triangulation (for stress reduction) with minimized redundant members or excessive areas (for mass control). Key: close the truss, optimize node placement to shorten loaded member spans, select minimal area sufficient for stress constraint.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Supports at node_1 (0,0, pinned) and node_2 (6,0, roller). Load at node_3 (2,0), applied at 10 units, -45°. Node_4 and node_5 placed to form top chord. Current truss has 5 nodes, 9 members (over-triangulated, leading to excess mass). High mass due to excessive member area assignment (several at \'3\': 1.759). Previous sparser design too lightly built, exceeded max stress (45.76, member_3). Both extremes underperform. Members carrying largest compression or tension (esp. under loading) need adequate section, many others can be smaller.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Pattern: Over-design → excessive mass, under-design → stress violations. Redundant diagonals or long members waste mass but may be unnecessary. Load at node_3 implies path to supports. Current node_4/5 \'arch\' adds depth—try reducing height, moving nodes in for short diagonals. Achieve minimal triangulation for closure and stability, eliminate least effective members, assign lowest sufficient area to reduce mass.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Propose a 5-node (nodes_1-5) Warren truss with a single top node (node_4) and a central intermediate node (node_5) above node_3, removing excess diagonal and side members. Top nodes provide height for arch action, short diagonals distribute the -45° load efficiently. Use selective higher area for most loaded members (those directly between loaded node and supports), lighter areas elsewhere.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A symmetrical, triangulated configuration economizes mass while lowering member stress via force distribution. Placing node_4 above midpoint helps convert part of vertical load to horizontal reaction. Triangulate only as necessary to close the truss. Assign high areas to only the most stressed (bottom) chords and direct diagonals, lighter sections to verticals or short members. Retain support and loaded node positions. Move node_5 slightly above node_3 for a central upper joint.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Steel, moderate sections, allowable stress 20. Loads: node_3 experiences ~10*(sqrt(2)/2) in x and y. Design key members (from node_3 to supports, and their diagonals) for ~7.1 load (from -45° comp). Member mass = length × area. Geometry: set node_4 ≈ (3, 2.5), node_5 ≈ (2, 2). Member lengths: node_1–node_2 = 6.0; vertical ~2, diagonals ~3.2–3.6. Assign area_id \'3\' (1.759) to most loaded bottom/diagonal, \'1\' (0.195) for vertical/top. Check total mass: e.g., (6.0×1.759)+(3×1.759)+(3×0.195)+(2×0.195)+(2×0.195) < 30? Adjust as needed.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member critical force estimate: loaded members (node_1–node_3, node_3–node_2, node_3–node_4, node_3–node_5, node_4–node_2) get up to 7.1 kN; selected area (A=1.759) gives stress ~4 (~7.1/1.759 ≈ 4), which is safe (≤20). Check mass: e.g., members (6.0+3.6+3.6 (approx for diagonals) = 13.2 m × 1.759) + (a few at 0.39, (e.g., 2 m × 0.195)), totals just under 30. Confirm with precise geometry and lengths. No single member has |stress| > 7.2 in previous, so this is conservative.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Design: node_1 (0, 0; pinned), node_2 (6, 0; roller), node_3 (2, 0; loaded), node_4 (4, 2.4; top right), node_5 (2.3, 2.1; top near center—placed above node_3, slightly right for geometry closure). Key triangulation: base, two top panels, two side diagonals, center vertical to share stress. Member assignments: critical bottom/diagonals get \'3\' (1.759), others \'1\' (0.195).
