The truss must connect all nodes with triangulation, using optimal geometry and member sizing within ±20 stress.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three base nodes on x-axis, with a significant diagonal load at node_3. All nodes must be connected in a closed geometry under tight mass and stress limits. Additional node(s) needed for triangulation, as only the three given nodes will render a mechanism and not a stable, closed truss.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The supports at nodes 1 and 2 mean the structure can only develop horizontal and vertical reactions at node_1, and a vertical reaction at node_2. The load at node_3 is off-axis and will cause both compression and tension in the truss. A classic optimal solution is a triangle, but all nodes should be spatially spread to best carry the diagonal load. A single triangle (with members node_1-node_2, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_3) risks inefficient, heavy chords. Introducing a fourth node above the line increases triangulation and reduces peak stress by distributing load over more members, while preventing mechanism formation.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation is essential. Placing a node above the base (say at x=2.5) can allow symmetric triangle formation and will transmit the load from node_3 more optimally to the supports. Keeping member lengths moderate will also help reduce mass. The triangle apex should ideally be as high as mass allows, balancing height with member length and stress management.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "To optimize, introduce \'node_4\' at (2.5, 2.8). This creates two triangles: one from node_1 to node_2 to node_4, and another from node_4 to node_3 to the base. This distributes the diagonal load at node_3 through both node_4 (upper chord) and the supports via diagonals. Select minimal area IDs (between \'1\' and \'3\') that satisfy stress and mass limits, barring high-stress members where a larger area may be needed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "1. Set node_4 at an elevation, say (2.5, 2.8), for efficient force flow; 2. Identify members: node_1-node_2, node_2-node_4, node_4-node_1, node_3-node_4, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_1; 3. Use force equilibrium at each node to estimate internal axial forces; 4. Stress = Force / Area; 5. mass = sum(length × area); 6.

Assign area IDs by rough force estimation: main diagonals need area_id \'2\' (0.782), base and top chords area_id \'1\' (0.195), vertical parts can use smallest allowed. Estimated loading: diagonals carry most of the 10kN load split; Forces up to ≈12 units (by geometry); area_id \'2\' gives F/A ≈15.3, safe under 20. Total mass: 6×0.195 + 3.75×0.782 + 4.49×0.782 + 2.84×0.195 + 2x2×0.195 = 1.17 + 2.93 + 3.51 + 0.55 + 0.78 = 8.94, much less than 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "All members checked for stress ≤20, total mass well under 30.
