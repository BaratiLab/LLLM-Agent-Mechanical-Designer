    "preamble": "The problem requires redesign of a 4-node 2D truss to meet max stress (|σ| ≤ 20) and total mass (≤ 30) constraints with given supports and a single diagonal load. The current design exceeds max stress at -43.17 and is not feasible. The objective is to deliver a closed, efficient truss layout—minimizing stress while maintaining low mass and satisfying the structural and geometric requirements.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs: 4 nodes (two at base with supports, one midbase, one top), one diagonally applied load at the upper node, cross section choices, and a history of previous design that’s overweight on stress. Objective: redesign to reduce excessive member stresses while maintaining low mass and full connectivity.",
    
    "analysis": "The current structure uses a nearly rectangular base (nodes 1–2–3) and a high node (node 4), with diagonal bracing. High compressive/tensile stresses occur in the chords and braces due to poor force distribution and member size selection. Specifically, member_5 and member_4 carry excessive force, likely because the load at node_3 is transferred inefficiently through a short link to node_1 and the diagonal to node_4. The structure is fully connected but inefficient in stress distribution. Key load path: load at node_3 introduces significant moment and shear, leading to overloading. Existing area selection is suboptimal for balancing mass and stress.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: High stress is localized in diagonals/midbase. The top node creates a long, steep brace, which is not optimal for diagonal force—spreads too much force into short, weak lower chords. Needs improved triangulation. Shorter, better-angled braces would improve stress distribution. Member areas could be reallocated for efficiency. Node positions should be adjusted without moving supports or loaded nodes.",
    
    "proposal": "Redesign: Create a more triangulated, symmetric Pratt/Warren-type truss by adding an upper node (node_5) to form a double-triangle layout with optimal bracing, maintaining unchanged base nodes and loaded node. Choose area IDs to optimize for the required stress (select larger areas for high-force paths, smaller for less-utilized members). Fine tune the upper nodes' location for ideal force-sharing. Remove redundant members at base, reposition node_4 closer to center for better bracing, and add node_5 as the apex. All nodes remain fully connected. Closed truss structure ensured.",
    
    "reasoning": "A proper triangulated truss provides multiple paths for force transfer, lowering peak member force and thus required area. Positioning upper nodes within the base span shortens braces, improves load path, and promotes force sharing. By creating two top nodes and triangulating, stresses will be halved or better distributed. Base keeps three points (supports, load node), while upper nodes are offset to center the load transfer and reduce lever arm. Chord members get modest area, while diagonals/braces get larger sections.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Steel, E is high, all joints pinned, self-weight negligible. Design relies on static equilibrium. Nodes 1 and 2 fixed; node_3 is the load node. Node_4 and new node_5 become apexes for bracing. Triangles: node_1–node_3–node_4, node_3–node_2–node_5, node_4–node_5. Cross-check: use A=[σ*F]/length, ensure σ < 20 for all members. Mass=sum(area×length) across all members. Choose largest section where expected stress approaches 18–20; elsewhere use less. New layout: node_4 at (2.5,2.2) and node_5 at (3.5,2.2) (neither at supports/loads).",
    
    "calculation": "Main span=6.0; expect diagonals around 3.0–3.25 units. Axial F ≈ 10 (load), triangulated with two upper nodes allows sharing: each upper triangle takes half the vertical load, so ~7.1/unit per diagonal. Estimate max force ~14 per member at most (with direction), so area=1 sufficient for most, but if in doubt use area '2' (A=0.782). Projected stresses: chord (F/L/A) ~10/6/1 ≈ 1.7; diagonals (F/L/A) 7.1/3.2/0.782 ≈ 2.8. Far under max σ=20. Total length ~16; max mass ~15.5, well within mass constraint.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Ensure all nodes are connected, use optimal bracing. Node_4 and node_5 off-center (2.5,2.2) and (3.5,2.2). Members: base (1–2), mid-base (1–3, 2–3), lower–upper braces (1–4, 2–5, 3–4, 3–5), top chord (4–5). Member area: All major load-path diagonals and base chords get area '2' (0.782). Mass of each: e.g. length ~3.2 x 0.782 = 2.5; six such ≈15; less for shorter members. Highest expected stress/area will be <20; all constraints satisfied. Fully closed by triangulation.",
