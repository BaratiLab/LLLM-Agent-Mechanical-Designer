Previous iterations failed the ±20 stress constraint (max|σ|=57.41) despite mass being acceptable (~23.38 < 30). The new objective is a structurally closed, efficient truss satisfying max|σ| ≤ 20 and mass ≤ 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given: load at node_3; supports at node_1 (pin) and node_2 (roller); five defined nodes; prior closed truss (9 members, 5 nodes) is overstressed at member_1. All nodes are on/below y=3.9. Major failure is insufficient area of highly stressed ties. Area selection and layout refinement are key.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Prior closed truss forms a double-tiered Warren-type structure, but member_1 (\'node_1\',\'node_3\') is overstressed at -57.41 (much higher than allowed). Main compressive tie carries much of the load due to the left support/left load position and truss geometry. Top member areas could be increased, or geometry minimized for force redistribution. The current triangles, though closed, direct nearly all axial load through a single small-area bottom chord. Increasing area or adding an additional node above the current apex (raising node_5) could spread demand, but raising mass. Reducing span between node_1/node_3 or choose optimal member areas balances stress/mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key pattern: member_1 (node_1-node_3) is the weak link. Increasing area on only this member overkills mass, while spatially shifting node_4/node_5 or redistributing the height can triangulate more effectively. Agonizing over the positioning of node_4 (apex) can optimize the angle of load transfer. As a single-shot solution, target area assignment and light (but complete) triangulation.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign slightly for better triangulation and load distribution. Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 (due to support/load/fixed) and tweak top node positions (node_4, node_5), raising node_5 slightly to even out triangle sizes and reduce stress in the bottom chord. Add a sixth node at midspan apex, making the top chord a true arch. Reassign member areas: heavily loaded members (bottom chord and first diagonals) get higher areas. Remove unnecessary connections to minimize mass. Form a simple symmetric Pratt truss.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "The Pratt truss efficiently handles vertical and angled loads through its diagonals and verticals, minimizing the stress on any single bottom chord member. Symmetry and member area gradation allow optimization for mass and stress. Key: distributing load among multiple load-bearing paths, triangulation for stability, and area selection for equilibrium.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume E = consistent, loads transferred at joints only. Bottom chord (node_1-node_3-node_2) must resist major direct force; area gets largest value but stays under mass constraint. Diagonals sized for >10kN × trigonometric transfer. Top chord and upper apex members can take minimal area. Add apex node_6 above node_4/node_5 for extra efficiency. Approximate member forces by hand using method of joints/method of sections for 10 kN at node_3 @ 45°, supports symmetric to node_3’s position. Assign area IDs accordingly: largest to major bottom and key diagonal members, medium for others. Calculate all member lengths, multiply by assigned area, sum for mass. Keep mass below 30.
