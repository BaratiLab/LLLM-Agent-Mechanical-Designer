    "preamble": "The problem is to minimize the maximum member stress of a closed 2D truss, currently with four nodes and five members, while keeping the structure within allowable mass (≤30) and stress (≤±20) constraints. Supported at nodes 1 and 2, loaded at node 3. The best prior design yielded max stress 9.65 and mass 14.83.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs: Four nodes, preset supports at (0.0,0.0) and (6.0,0.0), point load at (2.0,0.0), historical design with node_4 at (2.0,1.6) showed lower stress and mass than current. All constraints currently satisfied — opportunity to further reduce peak member stress.",
    "analysis": "The load is at node_3, close to the supports, with node_4 acting as the upper chord for triangulation. Current best stress is 9.65 at member_3 of the historic rank_1 structure, with total mass 14.8323, which is efficiently under constraints. Placing node_4 directly above node_3 at (2.0,1.6) in the historic case improved load path and symmetry. However, member_4 (node_4-node_2) experienced higher stress previously. With the current load and pinned/roller supports, symmetric arrangements that reduce force eccentricity can further lower the maximum stress.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "Pattern: Lowering node_4 closer to node_3’s vertical allows a more direct transfer of load from node_3 up and across the truss. Previous designs show optimality for mass and stress at node_4=(2.0,1.6). However, further fine-tuning y of node_4 could balance member forces more equally. Geometrically, moving node_4 slightly higher can distribute compressive and tensile forces more efficiently and could further minimize peak stresses. Ensuring area assignments are lowest possible without increasing stress above ~15 (well under the 20 limit) could reduce mass and maintain or reduce stress.",
    "proposal": "Optimize using the best performing historic structure (node_4 at (2.0, 1.7) instead of 1.6) for improved triangulation and more balanced force paths. Assign smallest cross-sectional areas that satisfy stress constraints based on historic trends (primarily area_id '2' or '3'). Retain node positions for supports and load. This aims to further lower the max stress (possibly below 9.0), without sacrificing mass or stability.",
    "reasoning": "By raising node_4 slightly (from y=1.6 to y=1.7), the truss becomes more equilateral, evening out force component ratios. This equalizes lengths in compression and tension, possibly reducing localization of high stresses. Since current peak stress is well below limit, we can use smaller area_ids for at least some members (except those with >7 stress loads based on history), reducing mass with minimal risk of over-stressing. The closed loop ensures all nodes are part of a connected structure.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Statically determinate, single load path, linear elastic behavior. Equilibrium: ΣFx=0, ΣFy=0 at each joint. Approximate member stresses from previous similar geometry; use known member stress scaling with length and node verticality. Confirm all member areas meet sigma = F/A < 20. Area_id mapping: member_3 (peak tension) likely needs '3', others may use '2' or lower, subject to calculated stress. For mass, sum each member's length × area. Members: Same as historic, node_4 adjusted.",
    "calculation": "Geometry: node_4 at (2.0,1.7)."
