The objective is to design the most efficient connected truss that minimizes member stresses and complies with mass and stress limits, by judicious member and area selection, possibly introducing new nodes for improved force distribution.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "We have three given nodes, two supports (pinned, roller), one load applied at node_3 (-10.0 at -45°). All nodes must be connected in a closed truss (triangle minimum). Objective: minimize stress, keep mass ≤ 30, and stress in [-20, 20]. Node positions can\'t change but new nodes can be added.",\n\n    "analysis": "Nodes are lined up horizontally (node_1 at (0,0), node_3 at (2,0), node_2 at (6,0)). The load at node_3 acts diagonally downward-left. Only a straight triangle will not distribute this load well, likely causing high stress in the member between node_1 and node_3, or node_2 and node_3. Triangulation will help, possibly with a top chord node. Adding a node above node_3 to form a better triangle, turning the truss into a closed shape (quadrilateral split into triangles), will better redistribute forces.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "A new node added above node_3 should help distribute the diagonal load effectively, reducing peak compressive/tensile stresses in any single member. The location of the new node must optimize load transfer to supports. Triangulation should also keep the truss closed as required, and a fourth node allows more area selection flexibility to meet mass/stress constraints.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Placing the new node (node_4) at (2, 1.6) directly above node_3 allows a vertical component to resist the -45° load. The resulting configuration (nodes 1-3-2-4) creates two triangles: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_4-node_3-node_2. Key load paths directly channel forces from loaded node_3 to both supports. Selecting moderate to large areas for the most loaded members and lighter areas elsewhere keeps mass down.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Members: 1-3, 3-2, 2-4, 4-1, 3-4. Calculate member lengths. Assign area_id \'2\' (A=0.782) to longest/most loaded members, \'1\' (A=0.195) to less-loaded. Check total mass: sum(length × area). Use trigonometry for member directions and load decomposition. Estimate forces using statics for simple symmetric system (assume pinned/roller at base, vertical load at node_3, vertical height of node_4 ≈ 1.6 yields geometry that provides good force distribution). Derive axial forces, compute stress = force/area.",\n\n    "calculation": "Member lengths: 1-3 (2.00), 3-2 (4.00), 2-4 (4.04), 4-1 (2.56), 3-4 (1.60). Assume the diagonal load (-10 @ -45°) splits approx. equally between 3-4 and 3-1 due to geometry and symmetry. Major loaded members: 3-4, 1-3, 4-1. Assign area_id \'3\' (1.759) to 3-4 and 1-3, \'2\' (0.782) to remainder. Total mass ≈ (2.00×1.759)+(4.00×0.782)+(4.04×0.782)+(2.56×1.759)+(1.60×1.759) = 3.52+3.13+3.16+4.50+2.81 ≈ 17.12 (<30). Estimate max member force (from vertical load and geometry): Fmax ≈ 10/√2=7.07, stress ≈ 7.07/1.759 ≈ 4.02 < 20. All constraints satisfied. Can reduce area of less loaded members to area_id \'1\' to trim mass further if needed.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "All nodes are part of a single closed connected structure with triangulation. Mass is well within constraint, max stress is well under the ±20 limit. Member areas assigned to balance mass savings and stress. Layout is efficient for the given load direction and support conditions. Member assignments do not duplicate, node coordinates are correct, all constraints are met.
