    "preamble": "The problem is to optimize a 2D truss with 4 nodes, specified supports and a point load, aiming to satisfy: |max stress| ≤ 20 and total mass ≤ 30 by adjusting member layout and cross sections. The current structure exceeds the mass constraint and is not optimal in stress distribution.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs include node layout, supports, force at node_3, and previous mass/stress for candidate trusses. Both recent trusses have either high stress or excessive mass, violating constraints.",
    "analysis": "Current design forms a two-bay, closed truss (nodes 1-2-4-3) with diagonals but has relatively high member cross sections, causing mass = 33.25 > 30. Largest stress = -9.04, so no member exceeds stress constraint, but mass violation is significant. Generation history shows a lighter truss (mass 10.49) but unacceptably high stress (up to -39.89). This demonstrates that downsizing all members cannot work: areas must be tuned based on expected force paths. The load at node_3 (-10 at -45°) requires a strong tie between node_3 and node_4 as well as the supports to transfer both shear and moment.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "The critical stress occurs in member_3 (node_3 to node_4), carrying most of the diagonal load. Main problem is oversizing all members to keep stresses low, causing excessive mass. Some members (e.g. base, some verticals) could be lighter; critical diagonals can remain thicker. Improving efficiency relies on member area allocation according to expected force magnitudes, and perhaps a more triangular mesh for load sharing.",
    "proposal": "Redesign the cross-sectional areas in an optimized, hierarchy-based manner: keep the same node layout, but distribute area economically: main diagonals large, lower chord lighter, secondary web members intermediate. Keep six-member, closed truss but remove any non-critical oversizing. Select precise area_ids for each member. If possible, add an extra diagonal between node_1 and node_2 to further reduce span loading, though mass constraint recommends not adding members unless critical.",
    "reasoning": "Using basic structural reasoning: The main vertical from load application to supports (members 3, 4, 5) carry the largest forces. A Warren or Pratt truss would distribute the oblique loading efficiently, but geometry is constrained. Use the minimum area in non-critical base/top chord members, modest areas in lateral ties, and largest available area in highly loaded diagonals. Triangulation must be preserved for stability. Keep node locations unchanged due to support/load constraints.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Only use listed area_ids; do not move supports or loaded nodes. Estimate member force directions based on geometry: member_3 (node_3-node_4) sees most of the load. Assign: member_3 (area_id '6'), members_4/5 (next highest, area_id '3'), base, top, and horizontal web ('1' or '2'). Calculate member lengths using L=sqrt(dx^2+dy^2), mass=sum(length*area). Roughly assume member axial forces: highest in diagonals under load, lowest in opposite web. All stresses estimated as force/area, set areas to keep |stress|<20. Iterate and check.",
    "calculation": "Calculated member lengths: member_1(node_1-node_3): 2.00, member_2(node_3-node_2): 4.00, member_3(node_3-node_4): 3.50, member_4(node_1-node_4): 4.08, member_5(node_4-node_2): 4.47, member_6(node_1-node_2): 6.00. Assign area_ids: member_3 ('6'=7.037, force=estimated 12->12/7.037=1.71<20), members 4/5 ('2'=0.782, light web), others ('1'=0.195). Estimated total mass: [2*0.195]+[4*0.195]+[3.5*7.037]+[4.08*0.782]+[4.47*0.782]+[6*0.195] = 0.39+0.78+24.63+3.19+3.50+1.17=~33.56. Still over; drop web area for lighter load, try member_3 '5'=4.887, member_4 '1', member_5 '1', others '1'. Compute mass: (2+4+3.5+4.08+4.47+6)*0.195+3.5*4.887=~3.83+17.10=20.93, now within limit. Stresses acceptable as force/area even with conservative load estimate.",
    "scratch_pad_final": "Assign member_3 larger area for main force transfer, all others with minimum area to minimize mass. Mass now below limit and stress expected within ±20. Confirmed structure is closed and connected. Node locations taken directly from original as per instruction. Ready to output optimized structure.",
