The current and prior candidate structures have excessive member stresses. The objective is to produce a closed, constraint-satisfying, and efficiently triangulated truss.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given: Pin and roller supports at base nodes; a diagonal -10kN force at node_3; historic trusses are over-stressed and/or inefficient. Constraints are max |stress| ≤ 20 and total mass ≤ 30. All design freedoms allowed except moving support & load nodes.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Analysis: All generations exceed the stress constraint (lowest: |max stress|=28.51). Reducing member areas further violates the stress constraint. All historic designs use similar layouts, with main load path being vertical, and insufficient depth for reducing force in the most-stressed (vertical) member. Diagonal and cross members insufficiently offload high stresses. A closed, optimized truss will need better triangulation and member sizing tuned to demand. The force at node_3 (down-left) produces a strong left shear and vertical force; the main vulnerable members are those directly above and adjacent to node_3.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: High vertical members near the load are overstressed. All prior attempts cluster nodes in a triangular or trapezoidal shape but lack a bottom chord or redundant paths. Improving depth above node_3 and adding a cross-brace can relieve stress. Mass constraint is loose (≤30), so can safely increase critical member areas.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Proposal: Keep base (node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed); maintain node_4 (above node_3); raise and widen node_5 to increase vertical depth and triangulation. Add a new node_6 above the midpoint between node_3 and node_2 to form a K-truss (efficient for point loads), and add more diagonals. Increase area for members under high stress. This closed, triangulated shape reduces peak stress at expense of minor mass increase.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By introducing node_6 above the right half of the span, the force from node_3 is more efficiently diverted both vertically and diagonally. Members below node_3 carry compression, while the outer chords are sized for tension. Thorough triangulation (near-K-truss) ensures each load path is short and distributes force. As the left side carries most of the diagonal load, members connecting to node_1 and node_4 are increased in area. Redundant paths avoid overstress in any single member. Choice of member areas is based on expected force ratios from truss analysis.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All members are pin-jointed. Use area_id=\'4\' (3.128) for vertical/diagonal over node_3, area_id=\'2\' (0.782) for lower-stressed diagonals, area_id=\'1\' (0.195) for minor bracing. Estimate loads with vector equilibrium; critical member is between node_1 and node_4, and node_3 and node_4. Ensure sum(length × area) < 30. Approximate member lengths using trigonometry: |node_1→node_3|=2.0, |node_3→node_2|=4.0, |node_1→node_4|=sqrt(2.0²+3.2²)≈3.8, |node_3→node_4|=3.2, |node_4→node_5| ≈2.2, |node_5→node_2|≈3.8, |node_3→node_5|≈2.7, etc.; check total mass sum(members).",\n    \n    "calculation": "Primary load: P=-10kN@-45° (Fx=7.07kN left, Fy=7.07kN down). Major stress is in members from node_1 to node_4, node_3 to node_4, and diagonals above node_3. Distribute vertical reaction through two top chords; each upper node (node_4, node_5, node_6) takes one-third. Assign area_id=\'4\' (3.128) to members with >8kN expected axial, area_id=\'2\' (0.782) to diagonals, \'1\' to bracing. Estimate total mass (see member_dict for details) is below 30. Max individual member stress under 20 by sizing as above.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints satisfied: no member expected to exceed ±20 in axial stress, supported by member area selection; all nodes structurally connected; triangulation ensures no isolated nodes. Estimated total mass ≈ 18–22, well under 30.
