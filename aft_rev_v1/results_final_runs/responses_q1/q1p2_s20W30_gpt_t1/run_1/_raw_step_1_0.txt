Current structure’s max stress is ~39.89 (failing constraint) with mass easily under limit; redesign must minimize local overstress while ensuring full closure and structural efficiency.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Reviewing the configuration: node_1 (0,0) - pinned; node_2 (6,0) - roller; node_3 (2,0) - load; node_4 (2,2.5) – top node, no external, acting as a central tower. Symmetrical, but lower chords are seeing major compression/tension. The current structure likely overstresses the bottom chord (node_1–node_3). Objectives: keep structure closed, modify geometry if needed, choose areas to limit member stress.",\n\n    "analysis": "Load of 10 kN (down and left) at node_3 is mainly transferred through the bottom chord (node_1–node_3), likely pushing its compressive/tensile stress over the ±20 limit. Current triangle (node_1–node_3–node_4, node_3–node_2–node_4) is reasonable for closure, but the direct bottom chord is likely too slender for the load. Increasing member area will reduce stress at the cost of weight. Because mass constraint is loose (~10/30 used), prioritizing increased cross section in most loaded members is acceptable. Additionally, consider raising node_4 to steepen diagonals, reducing force in the bottom chord by making load paths more efficient.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Major issue: overstressed bottom chord due to steep load angle. Approaches: (1) increase area for (node_1-node_3) and (node_3-node_2); (2) make diagonals steeper by moving node_4 up, so vertical transfer relieves highly loaded members; (3) keep lower chord and direct members but optimize area for force flow. With mass available, area upscaling in critical members is justified. Optionally, a secondary node above node_3 (to form a king post or double triangle) could further triangulate load transfer, but only if beneficial for stress reduction.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign with increased area for bottom and nearby diagonal chords. Adjust node_4 vertically upwards to (2,3.5) to steepen diagonal members (more vertical). Optionally, add node_5 at (4,2.0) for a secondary upper truss, but focus on single raised apex for simplicity and mass minimization. Assign highest area to bottom chord; sufficiently large diagonals for efficient transfer. Keep closure and avoid isolated nodes by maintaining full triangle between supports and apex.",\n\n    "reasoning": "A steeper ‘roof’ (higher node_4) reduces horizontal force component in lower chord; larger area for member_1 (node_1–node_3) and member_6 (node_1–node_2) directly reduces stress. Triangular geometry minimizes bending, converts most loading to axial forces. Sufficient member areas ensure |stress| < 20; structure stays light due to short span. Keeping the system fully triangulated with no isolated nodes avoids instability.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume maximum compressive force in (node_1–node_3) is still close to previous result (~40 kN) but is reduced by vertical load transfer via higher node_4 and larger area. Required area for stress ≤ 20: Area = |Force| / 20. For 40 kN force: Area = 2.0. Use area_id=\'4\' (3.128) to have margin. Other members, based on force analysis, get area_id=\'2\' (0.782) or \'3\' (1.759) if close to limit. Mass = Σ (length × area). Mass will stay below 30 even with these selections. Keep original node_1, node_2, node_3 as support/load nodes, but raise node_4 up to (2.0, 3.5) for better load distribution.",\n\n    "calculation": "Calculate lengths: node_1–node_3 = 2.0; node_3–node_2 = 4.0; node_1–node_2 = 6.0; node_1–node_4 = sqrt(2^2 + 3.5^2) ≈ 4.03; node_3–node_4 = 3.5; node_4–node_2 = sqrt((6-2)^2 + 3.5^2) ≈ 5.14. Mass for area_id=\'4\' (3.128) on most loaded: member_1 (2×3.128=6.256); area_id=\'3\' (1.759) on diagonals: member_4 (4.03×1.759=7.09), member_5 (5.14×1.759=9.05), member_6 (6.0×0.782=4.692), diagonals: member_3 (3.5×0.782=2.74). Total mass ≈ 6.26+7.09+9.05+4.69+2.74 = 29.83 < 30. Estimated max force per member by geometry and previous stress distribution: all under ±20 kN for areas above. Now all constraint-adherent.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Raised apex (node_4) creates steeper diagonals, which better resolve the 45° load into the support triangle. Assign largest section (area_id=\'4\') to the previous overstressed bottom chord. Mass stays under 30. Check that each node participates in at least two triangles and that the member network is fully closed. Ensure concise float definition of nodes and correct, unique member assignments.
