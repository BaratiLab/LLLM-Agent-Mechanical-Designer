    "preamble": "The task is to generate a fully constrained and efficient 2D closed truss structure for given supports (node_1: pinned, node_2: roller) and a single diagonal load on node_3. Prior iterations failed to simultaneously satisfy the max stress (≤ ±20) and mass (≤ 30) constraints. The optimization objective is to minimize stress and mass while ensuring all members stay within specified limits.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Analyze node locations: supports on base (0,0) and (6,0), with a mid-base node (2,0) and a top node (2,3.5). Load is applied at node_3: (-10.0, -45°). Constraints: stress and mass. Previous iterations showed overstressed bottom members and low utilization of top/diagonal members. Possible solution: increase member areas where stress is high, add triangulation to reduce long unsupported spans, optimize top node height to improve force distribution, and close the truss using efficient bracing e.g., a Warren or Pratt configuration.",

    "analysis": "Current and prior structures have triangle-based shapes, but the worst members (bottom flange) are overstressed while upper/diagonal members are underutilized, indicating poor load distribution and/or insufficient cross-sectional area where needed. Attempts to use minimal areas underestimated stress demand. Heavier members (history constraint_not_met_1) provided sufficient stress reduction but overshot allowed mass. The load at node_3 (near base, not at top node) generates a strong, off-centered diagonal force that stresses bottom and top chords. A closed, fully triangulated solution (e.g., Warren/pratt) allows stress dispersion across more members. Symmetry is partially broken due to off-center node_3.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Key pattern: bottom (node_1-node_2-node_3) is repeatedly overstressed under the given load. Top node is critical for bracing but may be too high for efficient force transmission; adjusting its height/position could reduce member lengths and stresses. All previous attempts underutilized areas in the compression chord and/or failed to efficiently distribute diagonal loads. Redundant members could be avoided if triangulation and appropriate area assignment are optimized.",
    
    "proposal": "Redesign the structure with an additional node at the top right (forming a 'trapezoidal' configuration), making the truss a double triangle (Warren/Pratt type) with diagonals, closing the top chord. This allows more direct force transfer and more members sharing the force, reducing individual member stresses. Assign areas based on stress demand: larger for the most heavily loaded (bottom), smaller elsewhere. Adjust node_4 (top) slightly lower and add a new node_5 at (4,3.0) to further triangulate the truss. All nodes kept at the original support and load locations as required.",
    
    "reasoning": "By closing the top with another node and triangulating with diagonals, we shorten the longest members and force paths, leading to reduced individual member forces. Members expected to be highly stressed (compression/tension chords) receive higher area; diagonals and less-stressed members get smaller area. This configuration efficiently manages the off-center diagonal load, minimizes peak member force, and allows mass to stay below the limit.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Maximum axial force under 10-kN load mainly along bottom chord. Diagonals and top chord will split much of the load in a statically determinate, symmetric manner. Calculated member lengths using sqrt(dx^2+dy^2). Assign area_id=5 (A=4.887) to overstressed bottom chord, area_id=2 or 3 for others. Upper node moved to (2,3.2), new node_5 at (4,3.0). Members: bottom (node_1 to node_3, node_3 to node_2), top (node_4 to node_5), sides (node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_2), and diagonals (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2), total 8 members (closed).",
    
    "calculation": "Member lengths (approx): node_1-node_3: 2.00, node_3-node_2: 4.00, node_1-node_4: sqrt(2^2+3.2^2)=3.80, node_4-node_3: sqrt(2^2+3.2^2)=3.80, node_3-node_5: sqrt(2^2+3^2)=3.61, node_5-node_2: sqrt(2^2+3^2)=3.61, node_4-node_5: sqrt(2^2+0.2^2)=2.01. For mass: sum(length×area) across all. Assign: area_id=5 (A=4.887) to high load bottom, area_id=3 (A=1.759) to others. Mass (approx): (2+4)*4.887 + (3.8+3.8+3.61+3.61+2.01)*1.759 = (6*4.887) + (16.83*1.759) = 29.32 + 29.63 = 58.95. This exceeds mass. Try area_id=2 (0.782) for diagonals and only use area_id=4 (3.128) for bottom. Recalc: (2+4)*3.128 + (3.8+3.8+3.61+3.61+2.01)*0.782 = 18.77 + 13.17 = 31.94. Still slightly high. Next, try area_id=4 bottom chord only; area_id=1 (0.195) elsewhere.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Bottom chord (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2): area_id=4. All other members: area_id=2 or 1 - assign higher area to main verticals (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_5), minimal area to least-stressed members. Check total mass: bottom = 6*3.128=18.77; 3.8*2=7.6, 3.61*2=7.22, 2.01*1=2.01; sum length = 16.81; 16.81*0.782=13.14; total mass=18.77+13.14=31.91. Almost at limit; so, set most diagonals to area_id=1 (0.195). Recompute and ensure below 30. Set top verticals to area_id=2, diagonals & top chord to area_id=1.",
