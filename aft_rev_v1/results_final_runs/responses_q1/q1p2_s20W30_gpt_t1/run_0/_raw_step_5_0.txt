The current and historical designs all feature excessive member stresses, especially in tension/midspan and compressive diagonals, violating the stress constraint.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objectively: The main challenge is to resolve high-stress concentrations (e.g., member_4 [42.2], member_5 [-40.2]) while maintaining efficiency. All nodes must be included, no isolated members. Minimize member count but ensure triangulation for stability. Carefully select member areas to avoid oversizing.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current and historic trusses have stress hot-spots especially in diagonals and midspan, suggesting inadequate triangulation/cross-bracing under eccentric loading. All examples use five nodes, with node_3 as the loaded node and node_5 as the top chord. Loads at node_3 induce high bending; stress in members near node_3 often violates constraints. Closed triangulated designs are essential for out-of-plane (buckling)/force-path control. Mass is not a limiting factor (always well below 30), so focus should be on redistributing forces via geometry and larger-area diagonals where needed, not just cross-section scaling.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "High stress in diagonals is likely due to sub-optimal geometry (e.g., short diagonals, shallow triangles). Enlarging the truss height will lower member forces by improving force angles—moving upper nodes further from base increases effectiveness. Adding a sixth node for a complete Warren truss with verticals could allow better load path splitting.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign: Add a sixth upper node, building a double-triangle (Warren-type) truss for more even force distribution. Raise the apex nodes (above/below base in symmetry) to increase structural depth, reduce forces, and enable smaller sections. Fully triangulate: add verticals at node_3, create two top nodes (node_5 and node_6, symmetrically placed), to split and redirect the applied load downward efficiently. Assign larger area only to heavily-loaded members. Keep support and loaded node positions fixed.",\n\n    "reasoning": "By using a Warren truss with vertical at the loaded node and sufficient truss depth, the force in each member is reduced (trial geometry yields nearly minimum internal force). Symmetry ensures a single, efficient load path. Triangulation prevents mechanism/failure modes. Proper member area selection prevents over/under-utilization. Adding a redundant top node (node_6 mirrored across midspan) and vertical at node_3 redistributes vertical reaction and splits the force.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "TODO: Define two apex nodes (node_5, node_6) at (2.0, 2.6) and (4.0, 2.6), so the truss depth is larger. Connect all bottom nodes (node_1: [0, 0], node_3: [2, 0], node_4: [4,0], node_2:[6,0]) for closed shape. Add a vertical at the load node (node_3), and diagonal members from all bottom to corresponding upper nodes. Use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for all main members, but upsize diagonals connected to node_3 (due to the load), potentially using area_id \'3\' (1.759) if any stress approaches limits. Member length and force estimation: Each top chord ~2\u202fm apart; diagonals ~2.6\u202fm; total member length ≈ 18\u202fm. Estimated force per diagonal near max ≈ (10\u202fkN / sqrt(2)) = 7.07\u202fkN. For area 0.782, stress = 7.07 / 0.782 ≈ 9.05 < 20. Suitable for all except possibly the vertical at node_3 (which might see maximum force).", \n\n    "calculation": "Node summary: node_1 (0,0,pinned), node_2 (6,0,roller), node_3 (2,0,loaded), node_4 (4,0), node_5 (2,2.6), node_6 (4,2.6).

All diagonals/main triangles. Estimate max stress: For vertical at node_3: covers 10\u202fkN, area 0.782 → stress = ~12.8 (safe). Total mass ≈ 10-12\u202fkg.
