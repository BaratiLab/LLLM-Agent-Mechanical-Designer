Objectives: minimize max stress (|σ|max ≤ 20), total mass (≤30 units), connect all nodes, ensure equilibrium and optimal member sizing from discrete area IDs.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes in a line; must generate a robust triangulated truss. Key challenge: large diagonal load at an interior node (node_3). Supports are at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller), classic simply supported truss span. All nodes must be closed connected, so a minimal triangle, plus possible interior subdivision, yields lightest, most stress-minimized closed system.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Node_3 is positioned at (2.0,0.0) between node_1 and node_2, and receives a sizable -10kN load at -45°. To best transmit load via triangulation, optimal is to add a fourth node (\'node_4\') above node_3, breaking the straight geometry and creating effective force triangles. The force can be distributed into the supports through two upwardly-inclined members from node_3. The external triangle (nodes 1–2–4) closes the system and ensures all nodes are included in at least two triangles. Member sizing must ensure |σ|max ≤ 20, and mass ≤ 30 units.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a single node above node_3 (say, at (2.0, 2.5)) forms two right-angled triangles. Members from node_3 to node_4, node_4 to node_1, node_4 to node_2 all act to efficiently distribute force, minimizing bending and maximizing direct load paths. Must avoid unnecessarily large member areas to keep mass low. Prioritize minimum areas unless stress limit is breached. Symmetry helps, as the load is at a midspan-like position.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Key is to resolve node_3\'s angled load into efficient axial forces. Forming a triangle by adding \'node_4\' above node_3 lets us efficiently split the load into compression/tension in diagonal members to the supports. Closing the truss with members [1-4], [2-4], and [3-4], and retaining the triangle [1-2-3] ensures all nodes are included and force paths are direct. All members will be checked for stress and mass; minimal area is used unless the calculated force requires a larger member for the stress bound.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Steel-like material, area in arbitrary units, max |σ|=20. Members: [1-3], [3-2], [1-4], [2-4], [3-4]. (1,2)–(3) members transmit primary loads; (4) handles vertical and diagonal balance. All members cross-sectional areas chosen from set. Calculate geometry: node_4 at (2.0,2.5). Compute forces using method of joints, resolve 10kN at node_3 into structure. Member lengths via Euclidean distance.

Estimate reactions, sum moments about node_1 for vertical loads: 7.07kN * distance 2m = 14.14kN; node_2 supports vertical load (roller), node_1 supports both vertical and horizontal.\\n\\nChoose area for [3–1] and [3–2]: force likely near max (7.07 kN), so area required: area ≥ |force| / σ_max = 7.07 / 20 = 0.353.

For [3–4]: supports vertical part (maybe up to 7.07 kN, area = 0.353, pick 0.782).\\n[1–4] and [2–4]: likely less loaded, try area_id \'1\' (0.195), check.\\n\\nMass:\\n(2.0 × 0.782) + (4.0 × 0.782) + (2.5 × 0.782) + (3.20 × 0.195) + (4.72 × 0.195) = 1.56 + 3.13 + 1.96 + 0.62 + 0.92 ≈ 8.19\\nTotal mass well under 30 units.
