  "preamble": "Current truss has max stress 15.36 and mass 27.9252 within constraints. Objective is to minimize max stress further while keeping total mass ≤30 and max stress ≤ ±30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current structure is a 4-node, 6-member truss with pinned and roller supports at node_1 and node_2, load at node_3. Members have varying cross-section areas. Max stress is on member_5 (15.36), near limit but safe.",
  "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-10 N at -45°) induces tension/compression in members. The structure is closed and connected. The highest stress is in member_5 (node_2-node_4), which has minimal cross-section area (area_id '1' = 0.195). The history shows a better design (rank_1) with node_4 moved higher (3.52,4.02) and area adjustments leading to max stress 13.12 and mass 26.5144. The current design is heavier and more stressed. Member_5's low area causes high stress; increasing area there or repositioning node_4 to improve load paths can reduce stress. Node_4 position influences internal force distribution and triangulation. Supports and loaded nodes are fixed, so node_4 can be adjusted.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Improving node_4 position closer to rank_1's (3.52,4.02) improves triangulation and load transfer. Adjusting member areas to balance mass and stress is beneficial. Current member_5 area is minimal and stress is max; increasing it slightly reduces stress. Member_1 and member_6 areas can be reduced to save mass as their stresses are low. Aim for symmetry and better triangulation for load path efficiency.",
  "proposal": "Adopt node_4 position near (3.52,4.02) from rank_1 to improve triangulation. Adjust member areas: increase member_5 area to '2' (0.782) to reduce max stress; reduce member_1 and member_6 areas to '2' and '1' respectively to save mass. Maintain other members as in rank_1 for balanced stress distribution.",
  "reasoning": "Triangulation with node_4 raised improves load transfer from node_3 to supports. Increasing member_5 area reduces its stress. Reducing areas in less stressed members (member_1 and member_6) compensates mass increase. Using rank_1 structure as baseline ensures better max stress and mass. Symmetry and closed loop maintained.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths from node coordinates. Use member length × area to compute mass. Estimate stresses by proportional scaling from previous FEM results since geometry and areas are close to rank_1. Check max stress ≤30 and total mass ≤30. Node_4 fixed at (3.52,4.02). Supports and load nodes fixed. Choose areas from allowed set.",
  "calculation": "Node_4 at (3.52,4.02). Member lengths approx: m1(1-3): 2.0, m2(3-2): 4.0, m3(1-4): 5.56, m4(3-4): 4.11, m5(2-4): 4.42, m6(1-2): 6.0. Assign areas: m1=2(0.782), m2=2(0.782), m3=3(1.759), m4=3(1.759), m5=2(0.782), m6=1(0.195). Mass = sum(length × area) ≈ (2×0.782)+(4×0.782)+(5.56×1.759)+(4.11×1.759)+(4.42×0.782)+(6×0.195) = 1.564+3.128+9.78+7.23+3.45+1.17=26.32 <30. Max stress reduced from 15.36 to ~13.12 by increasing member_5 area and better node_4 position, consistent with rank_1 results.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Design meets constraints: max stress ~13.12 <30, mass 26.32 <30. Node_4 repositioned for better load path. Member areas balanced to minimize stress and mass. Structure closed and connected. Supports and load nodes fixed. Ready for output.",
