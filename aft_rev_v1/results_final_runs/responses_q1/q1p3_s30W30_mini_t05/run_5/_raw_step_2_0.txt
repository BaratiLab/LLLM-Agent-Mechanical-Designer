Current max stress 13.12 and mass 26.51 satisfy constraints. Objective: minimize max stress further while keeping mass <= 30 and maintaining closed structure.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "4 nodes: node_1(0,0) pinned, node_2(6,0) roller, node_3(2,0) loaded (-10N at -45°), node_4(3.52,4.02) free. Members connect nodes forming a closed quadrilateral with diagonals. Areas mostly 2 or 3, one member area 1. Current max stress -13.12 well below ±30 limit, mass 26.5 < 30 limit.",\n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 downward-left (-10N at -45°) induces compression in member_1 (node_1-node_3) and tension in member_2 (node_3-node_2). Members 3 and 4 (to node_4) carry vertical load components. Member 1 is highest stressed (-13.12). Member 6 (node_1-node_2) has smallest area 1, possibly underutilized. The structure is stable and statically determinate with pinned and roller supports. History shows alternative node_4 position caused constraint violation (max stress 52.38). Current design is balanced but some members have relatively high mass (e.g. member_3 with 9.4 mass).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Current design is feasible with good stress distribution but member_1 stress is highest. Member_3 and 4 have large mass suggesting oversized areas or lengths. Node_4 position could be adjusted slightly to reduce member lengths and stress. Member_6 area is minimal, possibly can be increased slightly to redistribute forces and reduce max stress. Areas could be optimized by lowering area in low stress members (member_2, 5) and increasing in high stress member_1 to reduce max stress. Node_3 is fixed due to load, node_1 and 2 fixed due to supports, node_4 can be moved slightly.",\n  "proposal": "Optimize current design by fine-tuning node_4 position slightly downward and left to reduce member lengths and stresses. Adjust cross-sectional areas: increase area of member_1 to reduce max stress, reduce areas of low stress members (member_2, 5) to save mass. Increase area of member_6 slightly for stability. Keep closed quadrilateral with diagonals for triangulation. This approach should reduce max stress below current 13.12 and keep mass under 30.",\n  "reasoning": "Triangulated closed quadrilateral ensures stability and load path continuity. Moving node_4 slightly lower reduces length of members 3 and 4, reducing mass and stress. Increasing area of member_1 reduces stress by increasing load capacity. Reducing areas of low stress members saves mass. Member_6 area increased to maintain stability and reduce stress concentration in adjacent members. Node_3 position fixed due to load, node_1 and 2 fixed due to supports, node_4 repositioned within feasible range.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members behave linearly elastic, stress proportional to force/area. Calculate member lengths from node coordinates. Mass = sum(length × area). Areas chosen from area_id keys. Calculate member forces by equilibrium (simplified statics).
