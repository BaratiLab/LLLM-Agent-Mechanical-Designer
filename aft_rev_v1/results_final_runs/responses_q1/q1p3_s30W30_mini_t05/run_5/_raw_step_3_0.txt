Objective is to minimize max stress further while keeping total mass ≤30 and max stress ≤ ±30.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Current structure is a 4-node, 6-member truss with pinned and roller supports at node_1 and node_2, load at node_3. Members have varying cross-section areas. Max stress is on member_5 (15.36), near limit but safe.",\n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-10 N at -45°) induces tension/compression in members. The structure is closed and connected. The highest stress is in member_5 (node_2-node_4), which has minimal cross-section area (area_id \'1\' = 0.195). The history shows a better design (rank_1) with node_4 moved higher (3.52,4.02) and area adjustments leading to max stress 13.12 and mass 26.5144. The current design is heavier and more stressed. Member_5\'s low area causes high stress; increasing area there or repositioning node_4 to improve load paths can reduce stress. Node_4 position influences internal force distribution and triangulation. Supports and loaded nodes are fixed, so node_4 can be adjusted.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Improving node_4 position closer to rank_1\'s (3.52,4.02) improves triangulation and load transfer. Adjusting member areas to balance mass and stress is beneficial. Current member_5 area is minimal and stress is max; increasing it slightly reduces stress. Member_1 and member_6 areas can be reduced to save mass as their stresses are low. Aim for symmetry and better triangulation for load path efficiency.",\n  "proposal": "Adopt node_4 position near (3.52,4.02) from rank_1 to improve triangulation. Adjust member areas: increase member_5 area to \'2\' (0.782) to reduce max stress; reduce member_1 and member_6 areas to \'2\' and \'1\' respectively to save mass. Maintain other members as in rank_1 for balanced stress distribution.",\n  "reasoning": "Triangulation with node_4 raised improves load transfer from node_3 to supports. Increasing member_5 area reduces its stress. Reducing areas in less stressed members (member_1 and member_6) compensates mass increase. Using rank_1 structure as baseline ensures better max stress and mass. Symmetry and closed loop maintained.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths from node coordinates. Use member length × area to compute mass. Estimate stresses by proportional scaling from previous FEM results since geometry and areas are close to rank_1. Check max stress ≤30 and total mass ≤30. Node_4 fixed at (3.52,4.02). Supports and load nodes fixed. Choose areas from allowed set.",\n  "calculation": "Node_4 at (3.52,4.02).
