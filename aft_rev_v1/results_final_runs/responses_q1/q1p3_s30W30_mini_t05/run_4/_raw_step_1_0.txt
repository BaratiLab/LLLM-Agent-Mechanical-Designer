The total mass is within limit but stress exceeds allowable limits. Objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss that satisfies max stress ±30 and mass ≤ 30, maintaining given supports and load nodes fixed.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "The structure has a pinned support at node_1 and roller at node_2 on the base line. Load is a 10N force at node_3 at -45°, located on the base line between supports. The current truss is a trapezoid with a diagonal member causing high stress. Constraints violated are max stress only.",\n\n    "analysis": "The current structure is a trapezoid with a diagonal from node_3 to node_4. The load at node_3 creates tension/compression mainly in the diagonal member_5, causing 36.26 max stress exceeding ±30 limit. Members along the base and vertical sides have low stress. The load path is direct from node_3 to supports via diagonal and vertical members. The structure is statically determinate but not well triangulated to distribute stresses. The diagonal member is undersized (area_id \'1\' = 0.195) leading to high stress. Increasing area would increase mass beyond current total mass 20.4142, but still below 30 limit. However, a better approach is to redesign the truss to reduce stress concentration by adding more triangulation and optimizing node placement. The current node_3 position at (2.0, 0.0) is fixed due to load, and supports fixed at (0,0) and (6,0). Node_4 at (2,3) can be modified or additional nodes can be added to improve triangulation and load distribution.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key insight is that the diagonal member is the failure point due to high stress from load at node_3. Adding another node above node_3 to form two triangles sharing the load can reduce stress. Also, repositioning node_4 slightly to improve geometry and adding a top chord to close the truss fully will help. Ensuring symmetry about the vertical axis through node_3 will balance load paths. Using larger cross-section areas for diagonal members and smaller for verticals can optimize mass and stress.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign a closed trapezoidal truss with 5 nodes: supports at node_1 (0,0) pinned, node_2 (6,0) roller, load at node_3 (2,0). Add node_5 above node_3 at (3.0, 3.5) to form two triangles sharing the load. Node_4 repositioned to (4.0, 3.0) to balance geometry. Members connect as: base chord (node_1-node_2), left vertical (node_1-node_4), right vertical (node_2-node_4), diagonal left (node_3-node_4), diagonal right (node_3-node_5), top chord (node_4-node_5), and vertical (node_3-node_5). This closed truss with triangulation distributes stresses better and reduces max stress below 30. Use area_ids 3 or 4 for diagonals and 1 or 2 for verticals and base to keep mass under 30.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Triangulation is essential to reduce bending and distribute forces. The load at node_3 is downward-left (-45°), so the diagonal members from node_3 to nodes above must carry tension/compression effectively. Adding node_5 above node_3 splits the load path into two diagonals, reducing stress concentration. The top chord (node_4-node_5) closes the truss and stabilizes the structure. Using larger cross-section for diagonals reduces stress while keeping verticals and base chords lighter to minimize mass. Supports fixed, nodes with load fixed, others repositioned for symmetry and optimal load path.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic behavior, stress proportional to axial force/area.
