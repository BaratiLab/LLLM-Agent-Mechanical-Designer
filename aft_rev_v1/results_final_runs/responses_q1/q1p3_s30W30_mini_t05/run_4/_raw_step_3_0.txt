Objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss with given supports and load, minimizing max stress within constraints.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 is -10N at -45°. Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 fix structure. Current members induce high stress in members connected to node_3. History shows attempts to reduce max stress but still above limit. Mass is acceptable but stress must be lowered.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure has a horizontal base (node_1 to node_2), with two top nodes (node_4, node_5) and node_3 on base. Load at node_3 causes high stress in members 4 and 5 (connecting node_3 to top nodes). Member 4 is highly compressed (-75.11), member 5 highly tensile (60.7). Members 1, 2, 3, 6 have negligible stress. The structure is not optimally triangulated around node_3 to distribute load. History shows smaller top node sets reduce stress but still violate constraints. The load path is inefficient due to weak triangulation near the load node. The pinned and roller supports at base nodes are stable boundary conditions. The mass constraint is satisfied, so we can add members or adjust nodes to reduce stress without exceeding mass 30.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "High stress concentrated near node_3 suggests need for stronger triangulation around node_3. Using a single node_3 on base creates a stress concentration. Adding a third top node between node_4 and node_5 and connecting node_3 to it can distribute load better. Also, repositioning top nodes can improve angles and reduce member length for efficiency. Using moderate cross sections (area_id 2 or 3) on critical members will reduce stress. The base nodes and loaded node positions cannot be changed.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss with 5 nodes: base pinned node_1 at (0,0), roller node_2 at (6,0), loaded node_3 at (2,0), and three top nodes evenly spaced between x=1.5 and 4.5 at y=3.2 to improve triangulation and load distribution. Connect all nodes to form a closed truss with triangulated members. Use area_id selections to keep stress ≤ ±30 and mass ≤ 30.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation is key for stability and stress distribution. Adding a middle top node (node_6) between node_4 and node_5 splits the load path, reducing stress on members connected directly to node_3. Keeping top nodes at y=3.2 ensures sufficient height for better force angles. Members connecting base nodes to top nodes and top nodes to each other form multiple triangles. Members from node_3 to all three top nodes distribute the load. Cross section areas chosen based on member length and expected force (larger areas for shorter, highly stressed members). Node_3 position fixed due to load. Supports fixed. This design reduces max stress by better load path and triangulation.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic behavior, axial forces only. Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance. Estimate forces by static equilibrium at loaded node_3 and supports. Use trigonometry to find member angles and force components. Calculate member stress = force / area. Total mass = sum(length * area). Use area_id values: \'2\' (0.782), \'3\' (1.759), \'4\' (3.128) selectively. Check max stress ≤ 30 and total mass ≤ 30.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1(0.00,0.00), node_2(6.00,0.00), node_3(2.00,0.00), node_4(1.50,3.20), node_6(3.00,3.20), node_5(4.50,3.20). Members: base (1-2), verticals (1-4, 2-5), diagonals (3-4, 3-5, 3-6), top chords (4-6, 6-5). Lengths calculated, areas assigned to keep stress ≤ 30. Estimated total mass ~27.5 < 30.
