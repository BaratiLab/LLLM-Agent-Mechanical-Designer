Objective is to reduce max stress while keeping mass <=30 and stress within ±30, maintaining closed structure.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given load at node_3 is -10 at -45°, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) fix base. Current members create a closed quadrilateral with diagonal bracing. Areas range from 0.195 to 3.128 mostly. Max stress is from member_4 (-10.55) and member_6 (-9.17). Mass is well below limit. Current design satisfies constraints but can improve stress distribution.",\n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 downward-left causes tension/compression in diagonal members (member_4, member_6). Members 4 and 6 carry highest compressive stress, indicating possible local stress concentration or inefficient load path. Members 1,2,3 have moderate stress. Member 5 has near zero stress, indicating redundancy or over-sizing. The structure is stable and closed. The mass distribution is uneven with member_3 (8.11) and member_2 (6.87) heavier. The load path can be improved by adjusting node_4 position to better distribute forces and by resizing members to reduce max stress and mass. History shows no better design found yet.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_5 is underutilized and can be optimized. Node_4 is currently at (2.5,3.0), slightly right of node_3 (2,0). Moving node_4 slightly left or up may improve triangulation and reduce compressive stress in member_4 and member_6. Decreasing area of low-stress members and increasing area of high-stress members may balance stress. Symmetry is not required but slight repositioning may help.",\n  "proposal": "Optimize current design by repositioning node_4 slightly left and upward to improve load path and reduce compressive stress in member_4 and member_6. Adjust cross-sectional areas: reduce area for low stress member_5, increase slightly for members 4 and 6. Keep supports and loaded nodes fixed. Maintain closed structure with all nodes connected.",\n  "reasoning": "Triangulated quadrilateral with diagonals is stable. Load at node_3 creates compression in members connected to node_1 and node_4. Moving node_4 left reduces lever arm for compression in member_4 and 6. Increasing area in high stress members reduces stress. Reducing area in near zero stress member_5 reduces mass. Calculations will verify stress and mass constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic, uniform material. Calculate member lengths from node coordinates. Member stress proportional to force / area. Force equilibrium at nodes. Mass = sum(length * area). Area choices from given discrete set. Start with node_4 at (2.3,3.2). Member areas: member_4 and 6 -> area_id \'3\' (1.759), member_5 -> area_id \'1\' (0.195). Others adjusted accordingly.
