Objective is to minimize stress and mass within constraints: max stress ±30, total mass ≤30, using given area cross sections. Closed structure requires at least a triangle or polygon. Optimization focuses on triangulation and efficient load paths.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Load: -10 at 45° down-left on node_3. Supports: pinned at node_1 (fix both x,y), roller at node_2 (fix vertical y). Current nodes are collinear on x-axis, which cannot form a closed truss. Need to add at least one node off-axis to form a triangle.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Collinear nodes mean no closed polygon, so no triangulation possible with current nodes only. Load at node_3 is downward-left, inducing tension/compression in members. Pinned at node_1 fixes both directions, roller at node_2 fixes vertical. To resist load effectively and minimize stress, a triangular truss with a new node above the line is ideal. This will create two diagonals transmitting load efficiently. Members along base and diagonals to new node form closed triangle. Cross sections must be chosen to keep stress ≤±30 and mass ≤30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a new node above the base line between node_1 and node_2 will create a stable triangle. Positioning it near the load node_3 horizontally (x~2.5) and vertically ~3.0 will help distribute load. Members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3 form closed polygon. This increases connectivity and enables triangulation. Cross sections should be moderate to minimize mass but large enough to keep stress low.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (2.5, 3.0) to form triangle with node_1 and node_2. Connect node_3 to node_4 to transfer load efficiently. Members: base (node_1-node_2), diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4), and connections to load node (node_3-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3) form closed polygon with triangulation. Use area_id \'3\' (1.759) for base and main diagonals (longer members), \'2\' (0.782) for shorter members to save mass.
