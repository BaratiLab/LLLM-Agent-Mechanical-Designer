Objective is to minimize stress and total mass under constraints: max stress ±30 and mass ≤30. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) fixed. Optimize member layout and cross-sectional areas from given area_id options.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Load -10 units at 45° downward left on node_3. Supports: node_1 pinned (2 reactions), node_2 roller (1 vertical reaction). Current nodes are colinear on x-axis; no closed polygon formed. Need to add nodes to form closed truss. Constraints: stress ±30, mass ≤30, cross-sectional areas discrete from area_id dictionary.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 has components Fx = -10*cos(45°) = -7.07 left, Fy = -10*sin(45°) = -7.07 down. Supports react to balance these. Colinear nodes can\'t form a closed truss, so adding nodes above the line to form triangles is needed. Triangulation improves stability and distributes load effectively. Members must be sized to keep stress within limits. Mass is sum of length × area_id value; heavier sections reduce stress but increase mass. Balance needed. Likely failure modes: buckling in compression members, tensile rupture in tension members. Load path: load at node_3 transferred via members to supports at node_1 and node_2.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding two new nodes above the x-axis line near node_3 to form two triangles: node_4 near (1,2.5), node_5 near (4,2.5) to create triangular closed polygon: node_1-node_4-node_5-node_2-node_3-node_1. This increases load path options and reduces stress. Members connecting all nodes to form closed polygon. Use smaller area_id for shorter members and larger area_id for longer or high force members. Avoid over-sizing to keep mass <30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangulated closed polygon with 5 nodes: original 3 plus 2 new nodes above line. Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_5, node_4-node_3. This forms multiple load paths and distributes forces. Assign larger cross sections to members carrying higher forces (e.g., node_1-node_3, node_3-node_5), smaller cross sections to less stressed members. Use symmetric geometry for balanced load distribution. Node_4 and node_5 placed at y=2.5 for stable height, x=1 and 4 for symmetry and effective triangulation.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic, axial forces only, neglect self-weight.

Use area_id \'3\' (1.759) or \'4\' (3.128) for high load members, smaller like \'1\' (0.195) or \'2\' (0.782) for others.
