Objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss with given supports and load, minimizing stress and total mass ≤ 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes form a rectangular-ish shape with a loaded node_3 on the bottom chord. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) fix the structure. Current design has many members and large total mass due to oversized cross sections or long members. Max stress is acceptable but mass is too high.",\n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 is downward-left (-10, -45°). Support at node_1 pinned (both directions fixed), node_2 roller (vertical fixed). Current members include many diagonals and chords connecting nodes 1-5. The structure is closed but heavy. Member_7 (node_3-node_2) has largest area (area_id \'5\' = 4.887) and mass, likely oversized to reduce stress. The mass violation suggests member areas or lengths are too large. History shows a lighter but overstressed structure with fewer members. The load path is from node_3 diagonally to supports through chords and diagonals. The current structure is stable but inefficient in mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing member areas and lengths can reduce mass but may increase stress. Adding triangulation and optimizing node heights can improve load distribution. Node_3 is fixed by load, so no repositioning. Nodes 4 and 5 can be adjusted to optimize geometry. Triangular bracing between nodes 1-4-5-2 is beneficial. Avoid long slender members. Use smaller areas where stress is low. Aim for symmetrical load paths to spread forces evenly.",\n  "proposal": "Redesign with nodes 1 and 2 fixed as is, keep node_3 at (2.00, 0.00) loaded. Raise nodes 4 and 5 to ~2.50 height to form a shallow arch. Connect members to form two triangles: node_1-node_4-node_3 and node_3-node_5-node_2, plus chord members along bottom and top. Use smaller area sections for diagonals and chords, larger for bottom chord to support load. This closed truss with 5 nodes and 8 members is efficient in mass and stress.",\n  "reasoning": "Triangulation ensures stability and load transfer. Raising nodes 4 and 5 reduces bending moments in bottom chord and distributes load better. Using smaller areas reduces mass but must keep stress ≤ 30. Bottom chord members carry tensile load, diagonals carry compression/tension. The pinned and roller supports fix horizontal and vertical reactions. The load at node_3 is transferred via diagonals to supports. Symmetry reduces eccentricity and bending.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic behavior, all members axial force only. Calculate member lengths by Euclidean distance. Mass = sum(length × area). Use area_id values from given set. Estimate member forces by method of joints or sections. Stress ~ force / (area × member length factor). Choose areas to keep stress ≤ 30 and total mass ≤ 30. Nodes 4 and 5 at y=2.50 to reduce member length and stress. Areas: bottom chords \'4\' (3.128), diagonals \'2\' (0.782), top chord \'1\' (0.195) to minimize mass.",\n  "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1(0.00,0.00), node_2(6.00,0.00), node_3(2.00,0.00), node_4(1.00,2.50), node_5(4.00,2.50).

Choose areas: m1=2, m2=1, m3=2, m4=3, m5=2, m6=2, m7=3, m8=1. Total mass approx = sum(length × area) ≈ 2.69×0.782 + 3.00×0.195 + 2.69×0.782 + 2.00×1.759 + 2.24×0.782 + 2.69×0.782 + 4.00×1.759 + 5.39×0.195 = 2.10 + 0.59 + 2.10 + 3.52 + 1.75 + 2.10 + 7.04 + 1.05 = 20.25 < 30.
