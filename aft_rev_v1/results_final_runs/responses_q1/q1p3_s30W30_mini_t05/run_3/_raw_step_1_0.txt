The goal is to minimize stress further while keeping mass ≤30 and max stress ≤ ±30.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "The structure is a 4-node, 5-member closed truss with pinned and roller supports at nodes 1 and 2. Load at node_3 is downward-left at 45°. Current max stress is from member_5 (-16.12), mass is 22.56, both within limits. Areas vary from 1 to 4 (area_id \'4\' = 3.128 max).",\n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 causes high compressive stress in member_5 (node_2-node_3) likely due to short length and small area (area_id \'1\' = 0.195). Other members have moderate stresses. The truss is well triangulated but member_5 carries disproportionate load. Mass is low compared to limit, so increasing area selectively may reduce stress. Node positions are fixed for supports and load nodes, but node_4 can be adjusted to optimize load paths and reduce stress concentration. The current structure is efficient but member_5 is a weak link.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_5\'s small cross-section and short length cause high stress. Increasing its area and adjusting node_4 position upwards and slightly right may redistribute forces. The rest of the truss can maintain current areas or reduce slightly to compensate mass. The structure is stable and closed, no isolated nodes. Symmetry can be maintained as node_4 is free to move.",\n  "proposal": "Optimize current design by increasing area of member_5 from 0.195 to 3.128 (area_id \'4\') to reduce stress, slightly increase node_4 y-coordinate to 3.20 and x-coordinate to 2.20 to improve geometry and load distribution. Slightly reduce area of member_1 and member_4 from 3.128 to 1.759 (area_id \'3\') to compensate mass increase. Keep other members unchanged.",\n  "reasoning": "Increasing member_5 area reduces stress by increasing capacity. Moving node_4 upwards and right improves force angle and reduces bending effects. Reducing areas of members 1 and 4 recovers mass budget. This preserves triangulation and load paths, maintaining stability and reducing max stress. Node_3 and supports are fixed, so only node_4 is adjusted.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate new member lengths with node_4 at (2.20, 3.20). Compute member masses = length × area. Check total mass ≤ 30. Estimate stress reduction by area increase factor (from 0.195 to 3.128 is ~16× area increase, expect stress reduction by factor ~1/16). Adjust areas of members 1 and 4 to 1.759 to compensate mass. Verify max stress and total mass constraints.",\n  "calculation": "Member lengths (approx): m1 (node_1-node_3): 2.00, m2 (node_3-node_4): sqrt((2.20-2.00)^2 + (3.20-0)^2) ≈ 3.21, m3 (node_4-node_2): sqrt((6-2.20)^2 + (0-3.20)^2) ≈ 4.71, m4 (node_1-node_4): sqrt((2.20-0)^2 + (3.20-0)^2) ≈ 3.87, m5 (node_2-node_3): 4.00. Masses: m1 = 2.00*1.759=3.52, m2=3.21*3=9.63, m3=4.71*2=9.42, m4=3.87*1.759=6.81, m5=4.00*3.128=12.51. Total mass = 3.52+9.63+9.42+6.81+12.51=41.89 > 30 too high. Need to reduce areas further or adjust nodes more. Try reducing m2 area to 1.759 and m5 to 1.759: m2=3.21*1.759=5.65, m5=4*1.759=7.04. New total mass=3.52+5.65+9.42+6.81+7.04=32.44 still >30. Reduce m3 area to 1.0 (area_id \'0\'): m3=4.71*1=4.71. Total mass=3.52+5.65+4.71+6.81+7.04=27.73 ≤30. Max stress expected to drop: member_5 area increased from 0.195 to 1.759 (~9×), stress drops from -16.12 to ~ -1.79.
