Objective is to maintain max stress ≤ ±30 and total mass ≤ 30 with given discrete cross-sectional areas.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes: node_1(0,0) pinned, node_2(6,0) roller, node_3(2,0) loaded with -10N at 45° down-left. Current nodes are colinear along x-axis, no closed shape. Need to add nodes to form a closed truss (triangle or polygon). Max stress ±30 and mass ≤30 constrain member sizing and length. Load direction suggests diagonal bracing needed.",\n\n    "analysis": "The current nodes lie on x-axis: no closed polygon, no triangulation. The load at node_3 is downward-left diagonal (-10N, -45°). Supports at ends allow vertical and horizontal reactions. Without vertical height, truss cannot resist lateral load effectively. Adding a node above node_3 to form a triangle will create a stable, closed truss. Triangular shape ensures efficient load transfer with minimal members. Member forces can be resolved by static equilibrium, and cross-sectional areas chosen to keep stresses within limits. Mass is length × area; shorter members and smaller areas preferred but must resist stresses.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "To close structure, add node_4 above node_3 on y-axis. Triangle formed by node_1, node_2, node_4, and node_3 connected appropriately. This will triangulate and distribute loads. Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_4-node_3, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3. Check member lengths and select areas from given discrete set to minimize stress and mass. Load path: node_3 transfers load to node_4 and supports. Triangulation ensures no zero-force members.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) to create a triangle with base on x-axis (node_1, node_2) and apex at node_4. Connect node_3 to node_4 to distribute load. Members: (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_4), (node_4-node_2), (node_1-node_4), (node_2-node_3) to form closed polygon. Use triangulation to ensure stability and load distribution. Cross-sectional areas chosen based on force magnitude to keep stress ≤ 30. Use smaller areas for compression members (usually shorter) and larger areas for tension members with higher forces. This design balances mass and stress constraints.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic behavior, axial force only, uniform stress in members. Calculate member lengths using distance formula. Calculate member forces via static equilibrium at nodes (sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0). Calculate stress = force / area.
