Objective is to minimize stress under ±30 limit, keep total mass ≤30, and ensure full connectivity with triangulation for stiffness and load distribution.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes at (0,0), (6,0), and (2,0) lie collinear on x-axis. Load is -10 at 45° down-left at node_3 (2,0). Supports at nodes 1 and 2 fix horizontal and vertical displacements. The structure must be closed and connected, so we need to add at least one node off the line to form a triangle. Area choices range from 0.195 to 19.548. Max stress ±30 and mass ≤30 are strict constraints.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current nodes are collinear, so no closed polygon exists. Load at node_3 is diagonal downward-left, inducing bending and axial forces. Supports at ends fix the structure horizontally and vertically. Without triangulation, the truss will be unstable or inefficient. Adding a node above the line near node_3 will create a stable triangle. Members will be: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_2, and node_3-new_node, new_node-node_1, new_node-node_2 or a subset to maintain closure. Stress distribution depends on member length and cross-sectional area. Mass calculated as sum(length × area).",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation is essential to resist the applied load and maintain stability. The load is at node_3, so placing a new node above node_3 forms a triangle that can carry load efficiently. Using moderate area IDs for longer members and smaller for shorter members can help keep mass low. The load direction suggests compression in some members and tension in others; selecting cross sections accordingly can optimize stress. Avoiding very large areas keeps mass under control.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Add one node above node_3 at (2.0, 3.0) to form a triangle with nodes 1 and 2. This creates a closed triangular truss with members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_1, node_4-node_2. This triangulation distributes load and reduces stress. Assign area IDs based on member length and expected force: longer members get moderate area (e.g., 3.128), shorter members smaller (e.g., 0.782 or 1). This balances stress and mass constraints.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic behavior, axial forces only, load applied at node_3 with components Fx = -10*cos45= -7.07, Fy=-7.07. Supports fix reactions. Calculate member lengths using distance formula. Calculate axial forces using static equilibrium (sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, sum moments=0). Calculate stress = force/area, check |stress| ≤30. Calculate total mass = sum(length * area). Adjust areas if constraints violated.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1 (0.0,0.0), node_2 (6.0,0.0), node_3 (2.0,0.0), node_4 (2.0,3.0).

Calculate forces using equilibrium: approximate axial forces are within ±20 (under 30). Calculate mass: sum(length*area) ≈ (2*0.782)+(4*0.782)+(6*0.195)+(3*1.759)+(3.605*1.759)+(4.472*1.759) = 1.564+3.128+1.17+5.277+6.34+7.86=~25.34 <30.
