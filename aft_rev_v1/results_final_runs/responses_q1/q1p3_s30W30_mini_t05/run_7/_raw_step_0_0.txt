Objective is to minimize stress while respecting max stress ±30 and total mass ≤30, using discrete area IDs for cross sections.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Load: -10N at 45° downward-left at node_3. Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Current nodes are colinear, which cannot form a closed truss. Need at least one more node off this line to form a triangle.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Colinear nodes cannot form a closed truss; the truss must be triangulated for stability and load transfer. The load at node_3 is diagonal downward-left, so a triangular frame with node_3 elevated vertically will create efficient load paths. Supports at ends provide horizontal and vertical reactions. Failure modes: buckling/compression in members, tension in diagonals. Mass constraint limits large cross sections; need minimal length and optimized area selections.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a new node above node_3 at (2, 3.0) creates a triangle: node_1-node_2-node_4-node_3 with members forming two triangles: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_3-node_2-node_4. This closed triangulated structure distributes load efficiently. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) to form a stable triangular truss. Members: base (node_1-node_2), two diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4), vertical member (node_3-node_4), and horizontal member (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2). Select areas to keep stress ≤30 and mass ≤30. Use smaller areas for shorter members and larger areas for longer/more stressed members. The vertical member node_3-node_4 carries the load directly; assign higher area there.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic, axial forces only, uniform cross section per member. Calculate member lengths using distance formula. Calculate forces by static equilibrium (sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, sum moments=0). Estimate stress = force / area. Mass = sum(length × area). Area values from given discrete set. Select area IDs for each member to satisfy stress and mass constraints.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Lengths (m): node_1-node_2=6.0, node_1-node_3=2.0, node_3-node_2=4.0, node_1-node_4=√(2²+3²)=3.61, node_2-node_4=√(4²+3²)=5.0, node_3-node_4=3.0. Load at node_3: 10 N at 225° (down-left). Equilibrium yields member forces approx: node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2 in tension/compression ~7 N, node_3-node_4 ~10 N tension, diagonals ~5 N compression. Assign areas: node_3-node_4: area_id \'4\' (3.128), node_1-node_3 & node_3-node_2: area_id \'2\' (0.782), diagonals node_1-node_4 & node_2-node_4: area_id \'3\' (1.759), base node_1-node_2: area_id \'1\' (0.195) to reduce mass.
