Supports are pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Objective is to create a triangulated structure to efficiently distribute load and minimize stress.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes given: node_1(0,0) pinned, node_2(6,0) roller, node_3(2,0) loaded with -10N at -45°. Current nodes lie on x-axis; no vertical height, so no triangulation yet. Need closed structure with at least one additional node to form a triangle for stability and load path.",\n\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 is downward-left (-10N at -45°), causing tension/compression in members. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) allow vertical and horizontal reaction forces. Without vertical height, truss is a line, unstable under out-of-plane load. Adding a node above node_3 creates a triangle for load transfer. Members must be selected with appropriate cross-sectional areas to keep stress ≤ ±30 and mass ≤ 30.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "A triangle with base between node_1 and node_2 and apex above node_3 will create a stable closed truss. Adding node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) gives a vertical height for triangulation. Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_4. This ensures closed loop and load path. Area selection must balance mass and stress.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Use triangulation with node_4 at (2.0, 3.0). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4. Load at node_3 transfers via vertical and diagonal members to supports. Choose areas: small for short members under low stress, larger for longer or high force members. Prioritize areas 2 (0.782), 3 (1.759), and 4 (3.128) to keep mass low but stress controlled.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic, axial forces only, uniform material properties.
