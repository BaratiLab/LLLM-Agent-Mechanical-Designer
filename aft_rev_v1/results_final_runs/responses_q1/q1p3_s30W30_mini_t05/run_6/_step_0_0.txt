    "preamble": "Design a closed, fully connected 2D truss using three given nodes and one load, minimizing stress under ±30 max stress and total mass ≤ 30 constraints. Supports are pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Objective is to create a triangulated structure to efficiently distribute load and minimize stress.",

    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes given: node_1(0,0) pinned, node_2(6,0) roller, node_3(2,0) loaded with -10N at -45°. Current nodes lie on x-axis; no vertical height, so no triangulation yet. Need closed structure with at least one additional node to form a triangle for stability and load path.",

    "analysis": "Load at node_3 is downward-left (-10N at -45°), causing tension/compression in members. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) allow vertical and horizontal reaction forces. Without vertical height, truss is a line, unstable under out-of-plane load. Adding a node above node_3 creates a triangle for load transfer. Members must be selected with appropriate cross-sectional areas to keep stress ≤ ±30 and mass ≤ 30.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "A triangle with base between node_1 and node_2 and apex above node_3 will create a stable closed truss. Adding node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) gives a vertical height for triangulation. Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_4. This ensures closed loop and load path. Area selection must balance mass and stress.",

    "reasoning": "Use triangulation with node_4 at (2.0, 3.0). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4. Load at node_3 transfers via vertical and diagonal members to supports. Choose areas: small for short members under low stress, larger for longer or high force members. Prioritize areas 2 (0.782), 3 (1.759), and 4 (3.128) to keep mass low but stress controlled.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic, axial forces only, uniform material properties. Calculate member lengths via distance formula. Calculate axial forces by static equilibrium at nodes. Stress = Force / Area. Mass = sum(length × area). Check max stress ≤ ±30 and mass ≤ 30. Area_id chosen from given set. Node_4 chosen at (2.0,3.0) to form equilateral-like triangle with base 6m.",

    "calculation": "Member lengths (m):\nnode_1-node_3 = 2.0\nnode_3-node_2 = 4.0\nnode_1-node_4 = 3.606\nnode_4-node_2 = 4.472\nnode_3-node_4 = 3.0\n\nAssign areas:\nnode_1-node_3: area_id '2' (0.782)\nnode_3-node_2: area_id '2' (0.782)\nnode_1-node_4: area_id '3' (1.759)\nnode_4-node_2: area_id '3' (1.759)\nnode_3-node_4: area_id '4' (3.128)\n\nMass = sum(length × area) = 2*0.782 + 4*0.782 + 3.606*1.759 + 4.472*1.759 + 3*3.128\n= 1.564 + 3.128 + 6.345 + 7.863 + 9.384 = 28.284 ≤ 30 (OK)\n\nEstimate forces by static equilibrium (simplified): max force ~10N load distributed, max stress = Force/Area\nMax stress ≤ 30, with area choices above, stress ≤ 10/0.195 = 51 too high if small area, but chosen areas are larger, so stress ≤ 10/0.782 = 12.8 < 30 (OK)\n\nAll constraints met.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "Final design with node_4 added at (2.0, 3.0) creates closed triangulated truss. Areas chosen to keep mass ≤ 30 and stress ≤ ±30. All nodes connected forming a closed loop. Supports and loads unchanged. No duplicate members or nodes. Ready for output.",
