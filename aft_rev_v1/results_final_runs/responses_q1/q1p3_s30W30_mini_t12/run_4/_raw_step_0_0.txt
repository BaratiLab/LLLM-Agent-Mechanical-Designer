Objective is to generate a closed truss with minimum stress within ±30 and mass ≤30 area-length units.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes 1, 2, 3 lie along the x-axis (0 to 6m), load at node_3 acts diagonally (-45°) introducing combined vertical and horizontal force components. Two supports can resist reactions. Current open structure insufficient for stability or to transfer loads as a closed truss.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The load at node_3 creates tension/compression demands primarily between node_3 and other nodes. To form a closed structure, triangulation is necessary, adding at least one node out of the current x-axis line. Without triangulation, members will have suboptimal load paths, causing high stress. The pinned roller supports provide vertical + horizontal reaction allowing stable support reactions. Mass budget implies limited total member lengths and cross-sectional areas.\\nLikely failure modes: buckling compressive members, axial tension/mode with stress exceeding ±30 units. Optimization requires balancing member lengths (mass) vs. safety factor (stress).",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Pattern suggests a triangular truss with a new node above the x-axis between nodes 1 and 2 to form two stable triangles: (node_1, new_node, node_2) and (new_node, node_2, node_3). Load directed diagonally requires members aligned to carry both horizontal and vertical. This creates direct load paths to supports. Member cross-sections must be minimal yet strong enough, favoring medium area_ids from given set to keep mass low while avoiding overstress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Add node_4 at mid-span horizontally between node_1 and node_2 (x=3.0) and raised vertically y=3.0 forming a triangle with base nodes 1 and 2. Connect nodes to form closed polygon: node_1-node_4-node_2-node_3-node_1 with diagonals: node_4-node_3, node_1-node_3.\\nPartial triangulation reduces bending and translates shear into axial forces.\\nUse cross section area_ids starting from \'3\' (~1.759) to larger if needed.
