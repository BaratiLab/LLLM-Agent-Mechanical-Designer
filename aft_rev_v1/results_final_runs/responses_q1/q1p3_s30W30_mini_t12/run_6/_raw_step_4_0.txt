The objective is a safe, closed 2D truss under given loads and supports with max stress ≤ ±30 MPa and total mass ≤ 30.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Initial structure is a 4-node truss, rectangular-based with diagonal bracing, loaded only at node_3 with combined downward-left force, pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. History shows structures with lower max stresses (~13.52 MPa) but often higher mass (~25-38). Unable to meet stress constraint without increasing mass historically.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Nodes #1 and #2 fixed supports on X-axis baseline. Load on node_3 pulls down left causing large tension on member_1 (node_1-node_3), which is critical failure point. Diagonal brace from node_1 to node_4 and node_2 to node_4 carry compression but still result in stress violations. The chosen cross-section areas in history vary, but reducing stress requires either repositioning nodes to redistribute load better or increasing cross-section areas leading to heavier mass. Largest stresses concentrate on members near load node. The truss is a simple triangular prism with diagonals but insufficient for stress and weight balance.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: placing load node_3 low on baseline concentrates force in short, stiff member_1, noting high tension stress on member_1. Increasing node_4 Y and lateral position improves triangulation but can increase mass. Cross-sections scaled but did not reduce stress enough without mass explosion seen in historical data.",\n    \n    "proposal": "New design: maintain node_1 and node_2 fixed, keep node_3 (load node) fixed at (2.00, 0.00), redefine node_4 closer to represent a more equilateral triangular shape for lower stress, use symmetrical triangulation with an added node_5 to complete closed truss. Increase node quantity to improve load distribution and reduce stress concentrations while controlling total mass via optimized cross-section areas.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Introduce node_5 above node_4 to form a pentagonal closed shape with overlapping triangulation. This reduces large axial stresses by dividing load path between multiple members. Keep load and supports fixed due to instructions. Slightly relocate node_4 to improve the height so forces are better resolved. Distribute cross-section areas using larger sections on high-force members and minimal sizes on low-stress members per input area_id availability. This approach lowers max stress below ±30 MPa while keeping total mass < 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume: static equilibrium, 2D plane truss, each member axial force F = σ x A, length L by coordinates.
