Objective: generate new closed 2D truss with nodes fixed at supports and loads, reducing peak stress and total mass <=30.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Force applied at node_3: 10 at -45°. Supports: pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 set boundary conditions. Current members show over-high stress mainly on member_5 (node_3-node_4) causing the max stress, and lightest cross-section doing no good. History structure improves mass but too heavy (38.56). Need redesigned geometry and cross-section selection to distribute loads better and lower peak stress below 30.",\n  "analysis": "Current design creates a bending load path unevenly distributing stress, especially overloaded diagonal node_3-node_4 member stressed beyond limits likely due to shallow triangle between (node_1, node_3, node_4). The main problematic element is the small area ID (=1) on important diagonal member. Support forces create reactions quietly but insufficient triangulation and member sizing cause overstrain. Generation history suggests larger triangular spacing with node_4 elevated (3.5,3.5) reduced stress factor so stretching that idea. The simplest closed truss with 4 nodes must have adequate triangulation to transfer inclined loads and prevent unstabilized members in tension/compression. Node_3 and node_4 vertical offset must be raised for better moment arm and lower stress in critical diagonal members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Elevate node_4 (3.5+ y), reduce length of critically loaded diagonal and increase cross sectional areas on diagonals with tension/compression. Make structure symmetric or near symmetric to distribute loads evenly. Use a slightly steeper node_4 vertical coordinate to increase load distribution lever arm lowering member stresses. Use at least area_id \'3\' (1.759) or \'4\' (3.128) for critical diagonals. Utilize the area_id mapping effectively to keep mass <30. Consider a closed truss with 4 nodes connecting all pairs for triangulation.",\n  "proposal": "Redesign structure: Fix nodes 1 and 2 at supports, node 3 fixed at original compliant load, reposition node_4 slightly higher at (3.6, 3.8) from history best to strengthen diagonals and improve load distribution, connect all nodes (fully triangulated closed structure of four nodes). Increase cross-sections of diagonal members to area_id \'4\' (3.128) for load bearing members connected to node_4 and node_3, keep horizontal bottom beam members with lighter area \'2\' (0.782).",\n  "reasoning": "Structure is pinned plus roller with laterally applied inclined load at node_3 (2,0). Triangulation with node_4 high causes diagonal members to take compressive/tensile loads lowering peak stress. Length calculations using coordinates (Euclidean distance). Choosing standard member areas from data balances stress limit and mass upper bound. Elevating node_4 improves moment arms thus lowers forces in mid bottom chord. Ensuring closure (all nodes mutually connected) increases stability. Larger cross-section on key diagonals prevents excessive stress. Node 4 position fixed not to impair load/support nodes.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths calculated by distance formula for each member. Member mass = length × cross-section value.
