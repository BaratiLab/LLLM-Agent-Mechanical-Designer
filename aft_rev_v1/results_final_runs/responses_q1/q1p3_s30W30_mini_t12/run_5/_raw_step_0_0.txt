Objective: minimize stress within ±30 and total mass ≤30, by adding nodes and choosing cross-sections optimally.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given only three nodes in a line, forming a closed truss is impossible without adding at least one new node. Load at node_3 is downward-left, so triangulation to resist both horizontal and vertical reaction forces is key. The roller at node_2 restricts vertical translation only. Candidate solution involves adding a new top node to create a triangular frame for stable load path distribution.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Nodes 1 and 2 are supports; node_3 loaded. The three nodes are collinear on x-axis. The structure as-is lacks stiffness and cannot form a closed loop with members connected end to end. Load at node_3 generates horizontal and vertical shear and bending effects. Without triangulation, the system will experience high stress or instability. Adding a new node above node_3 allows feasibility of closed truss with triangulation. Members along triangle sides transfer force effectively and distribute stresses. We use areas within limits to control structural capacity and mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Pattern: assume one apex node at (2.0, h) with h>0 to close the loop with nodes (0,0),(6,0),(2,0). Set h so that forces equilibrate. Use smallest area to minimize mass where forces are lower, larger areas where higher force expected - particularly diagonal members from load node.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular frame formed by node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), and new node_4(2,h). Member connectivity: 1-3-2-4-1 making closed polygon. Node_4 added at (2.0,2.0) [a reasonable height balancing force vectors]. Smaller area members for legs, larger for diagonals with direct load transfer. Member members: (1-4),(4-3),(3-2),(2-1) plus base and diagonal (4-2), (4-3) for closed polygon and triangulation.
