    "preamble": "Current truss with 5 nodes and 8 members has max stress 18.51 and total mass 29.77 within constraints. Objective is to further decrease max stress and mass while keeping the closed truss and constraints intact.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given pinned node_1 and roller node_2, load at node_3 (-10N @ -45°). Current max stress is under 30 but member_5 is highly stressed at 18.51 with minimal mass (0.33), suggesting cross-section or geometry tuning might help. History shows denser and bigger mass designs reduced stress but exceeded mass limit.",
    
    "analysis": "Load transfers predominantly via members connected to node_3: members_2,3,6,7 involved. Member_5 (node_4 to node_5) bears highest tension (18.5), mass very low, indicating cross-sectional area may be under-sized or geometry causes stress concentration. Boundary conditions fix nodes_1&2. Member_8 (long base span) is low stress and heavy, potentially reducible. Members form a closed loop with triangulation except for member_5 as diagonal on upper side. Previous designs with additional nodes didn’t meet constraints, indicating minimal node topology preferred. Current structure is efficient but can be improved by adjusting node_4 and node_5 vertical/horizontal placement to balance member forces better and increasing area at critical members moderately.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: high stress on diagonals with minimal area, heavy mass on base member_8 with low stress, indicating uneven member sizing/force balance. Insight: adjust node_4 & node_5 horizontally closer to balance load path and slightly enlarge member_5 area, decrease area of heavy members with low stress for mass savings. Limit node move to non-support/load nodes to maintain fixed BCs.",
    
    "proposal": "Optimize current design by repositioning node_4 and node_5 slightly rightwards and upwards to better distribute forces, increasing area of critical members (member_5, member_2, member_6) from area_id='1'(0.195) or '2'(0.782) upward to lower max stress; simultaneously reduce area of heavy base member_8 from '3'(1.759) to '2'(0.782) to save mass while monitoring stress.",
    
    "reasoning": "Triangulation gives structural stability. Load direction (-45°) at node_3 requires good force transfer via node_4 and node_5 to supports. Moving node_4 and node_5 slightly right/up balances diagonal member stresses, decreasing peak tensile stress in member_5. Increasing cross-sectional area of critical members reduces stress. Reducing area of underutilized heavy base saves mass. This aligns with tension-compression balancing and mass efficiency.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elasticity, member force proportional to area and length, mass computed by sum(length×area). Calculate each member length from node coordinates. Estimate member stresses assuming proportional load distribution better balanced by geometry shift. Force equilibrium at nodes, finite element results approximate max stress reduction after area adjustment. Target maximum stress <30, total mass <30. Area choices limited to given set. Node_3, node_1, node_2 fixed; only node_4 and node_5 repositioned.",
    
    "calculation": "New coordinates: node_4 shifted from (3.10,2.50) to (3.30,2.70), node_5 from (4.80,2.30) to (5.00,2.48). Member lengths recalculated: member_5 length slightly increased, justified by better load transfer. Area ids: member_5 increased to '2'=0.782 area, members_2 and 6 increased to '3'=1.759, member_8 reduced to '2'=0.782. Approximate mass recalculated: member_5 mass: length×0.782 ≈0.77, members_2 and 6 incremented accordingly; member_8 mass reduced from ~10.55 to ≈4.7. Estimated total mass: ~28.3 (within constraint). Estimated peak stress reduced from 18.5 to approx. 14. Reduced mass on heavy member compensates area increase in small members, satisfying ≤30 mass limit. Max stress estimated under 20 on all members.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Check that all nodes interconnected, node_4 and node_5 move limited and reasonable. Areas from valid area_id keys. Total mass and max stress estimate under constraints. Member and node counts consistent. Structure remains closed and stable. No floating nodes. Support and loading nodes fixed. Output formatted as requested.",
