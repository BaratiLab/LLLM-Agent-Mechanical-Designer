Supports: pinned (node_1) and roller (node_2). Need closed geometry with minimal mass and stress ≤±30.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 causes downward-left force (-10 N, 45°). Supports prevent translation at node_1 (pinned) and vertical at node_2 (roller). The given three nodes are collinear; a truss just made from these is not a closed structure. Closed truss requires adding nodes above line to triangularize/load path efficiently. Without a vertical node, stress in members could be high, thus heavy. Mass from length*area must be ≤30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Plan to add one new node above at approx x=3 (midpoint between node_1 and node_2) to form a triangle, providing direct load path via tension/compression members. Use truss members connecting node_3, node_1, node_2, plus new node new_4 forming triangles. Triangulation reduces bending/stress. Need to choose cross-sectional areas balanced for stress and mass constraints.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at midpoint top (3.0, ~3.0) to create closed triangular truss: members between (node_1 - node_4), (node_4 - node_2), (node_4 - node_3), (node_3 - node_1), (node_3 - node_2). This ensures closed loop and good load paths. Area sizing: use smaller areas (~0.782 or 1) on smaller members under tension/compression; larger areas (~1.759 to 3.128) only where needed. Leverage symmetry and direct compression/tension members.
