Objective is to revise the truss to a closed fully triangulated 2D truss with node repositioning and member re-selection to satisfy max stress and mass constraints, while preserving supports and loads.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Initial problem: Load of -10N @ 45° down-left on node_3 with pinned support at node_1 and roller support at node_2. Nodes mostly horizontal base line with node_4 elevated. High tensile stress in member_1 indicates inadequate triangulation or member sizing.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current design has node_3 on the baseline between supports at node_1 (0,0) and node_2 (6,0). Node_4 is elevated (3.0,3.0). Loading applies tension/compression mainly between nodes 1, 3 and 4. Member_1 is highly stressed (-37.86), so understiff or undersized. Member_6 between node_1 and node_2 is direct span causing bending with improper stress distribution. Historic designs with nodes more centered (e.g., node_4 near (2-3,2-3)) appeared closer to feasibility but mass was high. The current structure is not fully triangulated as members form a quadrilateral plus a cross member between node_4 and node_3. Member sizing from area_id is mostly in smaller values, leading to stress issues. Closed, stable triangular layout recommended. Supports permit vertical reaction at node_1 and horizontal at node_2 (roller). For load path: symmetry and triangulation help spread stresses and minimize peak stress. Member selection should balance area to limit stress and mass to <=30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Structures with node_4 slightly closer to the loaded node and more balanced triangle led to lower max stress. Fully connecting node_4 to both supports and loaded node triangularly is important. Avoid very long diagonal members to reduce mass and stresses. Current member #5 (node_4-node_3) area_id=4 contributes mass heavily and reduces effectiveness. Optimal area allocation on highly loaded members could reduce stress below limit while keeping mass low.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign with 4 nodes: node_1 and node_2 fixed per supports, node_3 fixed (loaded node), reposition node_4 closer to center but lower than original 3.0m to reduce member length and stress concentrations. Remove member_6 (node_1-node_2 direct) to encourage triangulation via node_4. Use four members forming triangles node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_2-node_3-node_4. Select area_ids to sustain max stress ±30. Aim for lowest feasible total mass <=30. All nodes connected, forming closed primary triangles around loaded node.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangular forms provide static stability and obey triangulation theory for trusses. Avoid directly spanning supports by long members prone to bending with high stress. Pull node_4 inward and slightly lower reduces moment arms and member length, lowering mass and stress. Members attached to loaded node_3 must be sized adequately. We use the 4 member closed loop comprising: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2 plus node_4-node_3 for stability. We assign areas considering length and axial force estimates from load equilibrium assuming pin-jointed ideal truss. This structure removes the previously highly stressed member_1 and removes the excessive mass member_6. With supports pinned and roller at base, we can model reactions to compute member forces roughly. Symmetry aids in predictable stress distribution.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Weight/unit volume = 1 (linear mass with length*area), uniform material, pin joints.
