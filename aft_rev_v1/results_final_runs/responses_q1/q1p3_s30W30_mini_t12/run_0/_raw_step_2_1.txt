The goal is to redesign a stable, closed 2D truss with pinned and roller supports, a load at node_3, while reducing total mass below 30 and keeping stress under ±30. Node positions at supports and loaded nodes are to remain fixed.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Load: 10N at node_3 angled -45°, supports pinned at node_1(0,0) and roller at node_2(6,0). Current node_3 lies at (2,0) on the base. Node_4 is elevated at (3.25,2.75). Member areas in current design have significant mass from large section areas in some members (members 3 and 4 have area_id \'4\' = 3.128 and lengths ~3+ m induce high mass). Need to reduce areas and/or length while maintaining structural integrity and closed truss condition.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current truss is essentially a triangular upper frame connecting node_1, node_2, node_4 with base support points and intermediate node_3. The load at node_3 imposes tension/compression mainly in base members 1 & 2 and diagonal members 3,4,5. The history shows constraint_not_met mainly due to mass violation. Stresses are within limits but mass is too high. Structural inefficiency arises from long members and oversized areas leading to higher mass. Existing structures in history are not mass-compliant and have larger spans. A smaller, simpler triangular truss with a shorter length will reduce mass. Also, making the horizontal length 6m is fixed due to supports, but adding an upper node closer to mid-span reduces member lengths. Tight triangulation helps distribute the load more effectively reducing stress concentrations and allows usage of smaller cross-section areas.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Mass reduction is critical, so member lengths must be minimized and smaller cross sections applied. Node_3 with a 10N diagonal load at -45 degrees suggests a geometry that allows efficient redistribution. Optimal designs are symmetric triangles ensuring load paths are efficient and closed. Adding an upper node exactly mid-span at suitable height can create two triangles forming a trapezoidal shape which is statically determinate and load-friendly.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign as a trapezoidal truss with nodes at node_1 (0,0), node_2(6,0), fixed node_3(2, 0) with load, and reposition node_4 mid-span elevated to 2.5m approximately. Connect members to form two triangles: members from node_1 to node_4, node_4 to node_2, node_3 to node_1, node_3 to node_2, and node_4 to node_3. Cross-sections are chosen small to minimize mass but sufficient to carry force and keep stress under ±30.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Choosing node_4 at (3.00, 2.50) gives two triangles: node_1-node_4-node_3 and node_2-node_4-node_3. This divides load paths effectively. Member lengths reduce compared to original structure and maximum computed stress see lower values due to shorter unsupported member spans. Member cross-sections chosen among lower area_ids (1 or 0.195 or 0.782) to balance strength and mass. Symmetry and triangulation promotes stable, statically determinate structure.
