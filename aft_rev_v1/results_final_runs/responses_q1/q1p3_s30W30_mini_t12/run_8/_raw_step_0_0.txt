Objective is to minimize stress and mass under ±30 stress and mass<=30 constraints.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes node_1(0,0 pinned), node_2(6,0 roller), and node_3(2,0) loaded with -10N at 45°, simple linear line but no closed loop. Need extra nodes and members to form closed truss and transfer load efficiently.",\n\n  "analysis": "Load of -10N at node_3 with direction -45° (down and left) induces tensile and compressive forces in members. Supports impose fixed and vertical restrained conditions. Direct simple line of nodes cannot form closed truss, so add new nodes above to form triangle. Triangulation reduces bending and distributes load efficiently. Use segments to ensure total mass <=30 and stress <=30. Long members can be thinner for less mass but must still carry stresses.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Triangular configuration from node_1-node_2-node_3 is colinear (all at y=0), so add node above node_3 with y>0 to form primary triangle for load path. Ensure minimal member lengths and area selections to balance stress and mass. Use smaller cross-sections on shorter members and area ~0.782 to 1.759 for main compression/tension members as starting points.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 3.5), above node_3 roughly mid-span - this height helps create a stable truss. Connect node_4 to node_1, node_2, and node_3 to form closed and triangulated structure: nodes 1-3-4 & 2-3-4 triangles. Assign cross-sectional areas by estimated load share and member lengths. Members from node_4 to node_1 and node_2 are primary load paths, assign larger area to resist compressive forces, members closer to load and roller can be thinner.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Members: m1(1-3), m2(2-3), m3(3-4), m4(4-1), m5(4-2)\\nLengths: d_13=2m, d_23=4m, d_34=3.5m, d_41= sqrt(2^2+3.5^2)=4.03m, d_42= sqrt(4^2+3.5^2)=5.32m\\n\\nArea pick: Start with mid to high values (area_id \'2\' to \'5\', i.e. 0.782 to 4.887)\\nCalculate axial forces from equilibrium: force balance vertical & horizontal at loaded node.\\nEstimate stress as force/area.
