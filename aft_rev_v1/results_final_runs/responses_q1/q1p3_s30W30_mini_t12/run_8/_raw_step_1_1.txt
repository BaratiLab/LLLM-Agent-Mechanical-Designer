Constraints: stress max ±30 and total mass ≤30 are satisfied. Objective: reduce max stress and total mass while maintaining structural integrity.",\n  "analysis": "Load applied at node_3 directed downward-left(-10N at 45°). Node_1 is pinned (full constraint), and Node_2 is a roller (vertical constrained). Current connections are forming a planar shape with members sized mainly large near node_2 bearing bigger mass, medium near node_3 with highest stress (-12.49 in member_1). The load path heavily stresses member_1 in compression and member_3 in tension. Upper triangle uses smaller area members but still moderately stressed. The structure is stable and connected but larger cross section members on right side contribute significantly to mass. Member_2\'s low stress (-1.53) indicates possible oversizing. Node_4 located fairly high at y=3.5 helps form the vertical support truss.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Stress is unequally distributed; member_1 and member_3 are critical. Areas toward roller node_2 can be optimized. Mass could be reduced from member_2 or ^5, which have large areas but low stress. Slight vertical lowering of node_4 might redistribute forces and reduce high stress near node_3. Node_3 position fixed due to load. Supports unmovable. Reliable closed triangulated structure ensures no node isolation.",\n  "proposal": "Optimize current design by adjusting cross sectional areas mainly reducing overdesigned members (member_2 and member_5). Slightly lower node_4 from 3.5 to approx 3.25m to shift stress towards balanced distribution, maintaining closed truss with triangles. Fix all given node coordinates except node_4. Maintain or reduce area size of members on right side, while slightly increasing area on understress critical members (e.g., member_1 and member_3) to redistribute forces and reduce maximum stress magnitudes.",\n  "reasoning": "Triangulation and direct load path suggest lowering node_4 reduces lever arm effect on members_4 and 5 and redistributes resultant forces. Member_1 stressed -12.487 can be mildly increased area from \'2\': 0.782 to \'3\': 1.759. Member_3 in moderate tension -9.04 increase area also to \'3\' from \'2\'. Member_2 with low stress (-1.53) can reduce to \'1\':0.195 from \'3\' to lower mass, and similarly member_5 can be reduced from \'3\' to \'2\'. Member_4 is reasonably sized near 0.782 so keep at \'2\'.
