    "preamble": "Optimize a closed 2D truss with 3 given base nodes forming a line, subjected to a diagonal downward load at node_3 and boundary conditions pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. The goal is minimizing max stress and weight under constraints of stress ≤ ±30 and total mass ≤ 30, using discrete area IDs for cross-sections.",

    "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes are colinear at y=0: node_1 at (0,0), node_3 at (2,0), node_2 at (6,0). Load (-10, -45°) on node_3 creates vertical and horizontal components ≈ -7.07 x, -7.07 y. Support conditions prevent vertical displacement at node_1 and vertical + horizontal constraint at node_2 (roller vertical, pinned horizontal at node_1). Initial design must create a closed structure introducing nodes above baseline to resolve load paths and form triangulated members. Initial guess: add one elevated node between node_3 and node_2 to support load and close truss.",

    "analysis": "Current linear node layout is unstable under applied load on node_3; proper triangulation is essential. To resist diagonal force at node_3, introduce a vertical or inclined support; a closed truss triangle including node_3 and new elevated node distributes forces effectively. Boundary conditions imply node_1 horizontally restrained and node_2 vertically pinned, therefore structure must channel horizontal forces to node_1 and vertical to node_2. Without vertical height, no out-of-plane members provide resistance to load. Mass depends on total member lengths × area. Need members with larger areas on highly stressed members and smaller on less stressed to meet mass and stress restrictions.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Member forces must be optimized by adding a node elevated to create two triangles for load distribution. Adding node_4 above node_3-node_2 midpoint increases stiffness and avoids excessive stress concentration. Use area_id = 2 (0.782) or 3 (1.759) for diagonal members under higher load, smaller area for horizontal lower chords. Avoid overmassive members to stay under 30 mass three-member systems. Stress assumptions based on equilibrium and force triangles; tensile/compressive example member lengths: ~2m horizontal, ~3.6m diagonal members (from geometry).",

    "reasoning": "Add new node_4 at midpoint x=4.0, y=2.0 (height to ensure closure and stiff member length) forming two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4). Connections: lower chord (node_1-node_3), lower chord (node_3-node_2), diagonals (node_1-node_4), (node_4-node_2), and vertical to node_3 to node_4. The closed pentagon connection simplifies to a triangulated truss avoiding bending loads and minimizing stress. Area distribution: smaller areas on lower chords, larger on diagonals, considering load paths. This configuration balances forces efficiently under the diagonal load with a stable triangular spatial geometry.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume truss members carry axial forces only; calculate member lengths by Euclidean distance. Calculate axial forces by static equilibrium at loaded node_3, split the diagonal (-7.07,-7.07) force using two diagonals tension/compression resolving vertically and horizontally at supports. Ensure max stress ≤ 30 by adjusting area selections from area_id dict, starting from medium (area_id '2':0.782) to higher (up to area_id '5':4.887) where required. Calculate total mass = Σ(member_length × area). Equilibrium equations at loaded node give axial member forces. Stress = Force / Area; approximate forces and then select members to not exceed ±30 stress. Perform mass check after first pass, iterate if mass >30.",
