Mass is area × length sum (max 30), only standard cross section areas allowed.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The configuration forms a basic horizontal triangle, but node_3 is collinear. A horizontal member-only setup (nodes in a line) can produce very high stresses (zero area in vertical plane), so triangulation is essential. Closure and member orientation are important for stability. Adding a single upper node above the span enables efficient force distribution and stress reduction. All supports are along y=0, thus at least one node should be above y=0 for depth/height, providing vertical load-carrying capability and forming two triangles.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "With three collinear nodes, adding a fourth node above y=0 is critical for structural closure and forming a statically determinate (or slightly indeterminate) truss. Positioning should give near-symmetry for even force splitting. Mass must remain under 30, so avoid oversizing members. Assign smaller cross sections to less stressed members, and larger to those along main load paths.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Place new node_4 at an effective height ~1.8-2.0 above midpoint (for visual and geometric balance). All four nodes (two supports, loaded node, and elevated node) will be connected to ensure closure. This creates two triangles sharing a base and distributes load directly from node_3 to supports and via node_4. It\'s best to connect node_3-node_4, node_4 to both supports, node_3 to both supports, and node_1-node_2. Member sizing based on expected force: main diagonals and loaded members use slightly larger area, others smaller.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Set node_4 at midpoint x=3.0, y=1.8 (gives a rise:span ratio of 0.3 so member angles aren\'t too flat). List members: (1-2), (1-3), (2-3), (1-4), (2-4), (3-4). For each, estimate length and area. Loading at node_3 (-10 at -45°) splits axially into -7.07 x, -7.07 y. Node_3 connected to node_1, node_2, node_4, so these three members transfer load to supports and node_4. Assume: diagonals (3-4), (1-4), (2-4) get moderate-high compression/tension. Horizontals get lower stress.
