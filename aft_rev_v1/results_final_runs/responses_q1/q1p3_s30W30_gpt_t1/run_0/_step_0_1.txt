    "preamble": "Optimization of a 2D truss connecting three given nodes (one loaded, two supported) to efficiently support a diagonal downward load. Objective is to minimize the maximum member stress (within ±30) and total mass (≤30), using only given cross-section options, while forming a closed, triangulated truss.",

    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs reveal a minimal node set forming a triangle at the base of a truss. The load at node_3 is substantial and diagonal, requiring direct and efficient load paths. The supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) suggest a stable base. Structural closure with triangulation is critical for stiffness and spreading force efficiently.",

    "analysis": "node_3, midway at (2.0, 0.0), is subjected to a -10@-45° load (downwards and leftwards). node_1 (0,0) is pinned, node_2 (6,0) is a roller, forming a horizontal base (6 units). To close the structure and optimize force flow, we need at least one more node above the base to triangulate and redirect the force path along efficient struts. A common high-efficiency topology would add a node_4 above node_3, completing a triangle and distributing the force via direct compression/tension along diagonals. Closed structure would be ('node_1' <-> 'node_4' <-> 'node_2' <-> 'node_3' <-> 'node_1'), with diagonals linking to node_3 and vertical/horizontal members, forming a Warren or Pratt type truss.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Key insight: With three collinear bottom nodes, most efficient way to close the truss is to lift node_4 vertically above node_3, creating intersecting diagonals. Height and member sizing must balance stress and mass. Area must be increased for heavily loaded members while using lighter sections elsewhere to minimize total mass. Use trigonometry and statics to inform nodal layout and member sizing.",

    "reasoning": "Adding a single upper node ('node_4') vertically above 'node_3' forms two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4). This configuration efficiently routes the diagonal load through short, direct struts (minimizing bending). We can place node_4 at (2, h), with h optimized to maintain mass below 30 and stresses below 30. Choosing a moderate height (4 units above base) will form two isosceles triangles for good force angles, keeping member lengths compact. Use large area where force is highest (lower diagonals), lighter sections where possible. Area IDs are selected accordingly.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Let node_4 = (2.0, h). h estimated: try h=4.0. Lengths: node_3-node_4 = h; node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4 use Pythagoras: sqrt((2)^2 + (4)^2)=4.47, sqrt((4)^2+(4)^2)=5.66. Horizontal base members: node_1-node_3=2.0, node_3-node_2=4.0. Mass=sum(member_length × area). Use largest area for diagonals (expected highest force); try area_id '0' (A=1) for top, '2' (A=0.782) for diagonals, '1' (A=0.195) for base. Check total mass and estimated internal forces via virtual work/simplified statics.",

    "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3=2.0, node_3-node_2=4.0, node_1-node_4=4.47, node_2-node_4=5.66, node_3-node_4=4.0. Mass: (2.0×0.195)+(4.0×0.195)+(4.47×0.782)+(5.66×0.782)+(4.0×1.0) ≈ 0.39+0.78+3.50+4.43+4.0=13.1. Well under mass limit. Forces: Diagonal and vertical members are expected to carry majority of the load: with isosceles triangles, diagonals aligned fairly close with load direction, so force in diagonals ≈10kN/sin(63.4°)~11.2kN gives stress ~14 for area=0.782, within limit. Heavier area assigned to vertical member connecting top node to loaded node (area_id '0', A=1.0). Bottom members see less force due to direct path in diagonals.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints satisfied: closed, triangulated, all nodes connected, mass <30 (13.1), max stress <30, direct load paths, base and diagonals optimized for stress and weight. No duplicate nodes or members. Member sizing matches expected force path; node placement is precise. Ready for output.",
