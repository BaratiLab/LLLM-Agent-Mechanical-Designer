The design must keep all stresses within ±30, and total mass below 30, choosing member areas only from a given discrete set. The objective is to create an efficient, triangulated truss—potentially with one added node—to efficiently carry the 45-degree load.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The key is to directly transfer the off-axis load (node_3) to supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller), ensuring all nodes are in a single triangulated closed system. Additional node(s) may be needed for load redirection and truss closure. Likely a triangle with a high apex above node_3 for efficient load path.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Given that the load at node_3 is both leftward and downward (-45 degree), a triangle with a high apex node_4 above the other nodes optimally transfers vertical and horizontal components to the supports. Triangulation below would not optimally resolve the 45-degree load into members leading to the supports. The pinned at node_1 can take both directions, roller at node_2 only vertical. Without a fourth node, head member stress would be very high (since the base is very wide and node_3 not central). Failure modes: excessive tension/compression in the bottom chord, or at the loaded member.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The truss must close—minimum three triangles for three grounded points; four nodes forming two triangles is universally stiffer and offers more degrees of freedom for stress/allocation. A single apex node above (mid x, raised y) will allow for two nearly equal-length compression/tension diagonals from node_3 to node_1/node_2 and distribute the large angled load. We must minimize member length and area for mass, but avoid undersizing and exceeding stress.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (3.0, y), approximately above node_3 at the mid-span, high enough to split force paths effectively but not so high as to increase member length (increasing mass). Connect all existing nodes in a closed mesh: m1: node_1–node_2 (base), m2: node_1–node_3, m3: node_2–node_3, m4: node_1–node_4, m5: node_2–node_4, m6: node_3–node_4. All nodes thus participate in a fully triangulated truss. Assign lowest feasible area to each member, increasing where needed by stress calculation.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume truss bars, pin-jointed, only axial forces. Areas chosen per member based on calculated force = (max force/allowable stress). For mass, sum (length × area). For stress, F/A ≤ 30. Estimate preliminary nodal coordinates: Place node_4 at (3.0, 2.5) for good compromise (midpoint x between node_1 and node_2, y chosen for efficient load spread without excessive length, moderate apex).
