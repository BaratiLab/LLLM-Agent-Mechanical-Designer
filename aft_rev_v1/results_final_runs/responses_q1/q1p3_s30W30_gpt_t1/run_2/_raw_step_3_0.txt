The current design exceeds the mass constraint, while previous attempts exceeded the stress constraint. The optimization goal is to achieve a lightweight, low-stress, fully closed truss given load and support conditions.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given: Node_1 and node_2 are fixed (pinned and roller), load is at node_3 (-10.0, -45.0 deg). History shows mass too high in current (54.19) and stress too high in prior attempts (up to 49.56). The aim is to achieve max(abs(stress)) ≤ 30 with total mass ≤ 30, using available areas and without altering support/load node positions. All nodes must be fully connected.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Analysis of previous and current structures shows that attempts to minimize mass via small areas led to high stresses (over 36.76 and 49.56), while increasing areas lowered stresses but resulted in excessive weight. Current structure, while safely below stress cap (9.14), is nearly double the mass limit. The truss must channel the downward and leftward load at node_3 efficiently to both supports, tolerate long-span behavior, and use minimal material. Current node layout (nodes_1,2,3 on base, others above) can be condensed for efficiency; member triangulation is sufficient but likely over-redundant, increasing unnecessary mass. Keeping the two supports and the load node fixed in position is required. Structural closure demands that upper nodes contribute to adequate triangulation - but may be repositioned, condensed, or reduced for weight savings.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Weight is being driven by heavy reliance on wide areas for all members, especially those spanning long distances (e.g., member_1: 18.78 mass). Redundancy is causing extra mass. Failure in other cases is caused by insufficient member cross-section near highly stressed regions. Topology must balance between adequate triangulation for stability and lean material use. Consider removing excess intermediate nodes if possible or repositioning intermediate nodes to form a more compact truss, reducing member length and mass.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign for minimal structure: Use a Warren truss layout (triangulated, closed), with two upper nodes positioned to keep member lengths moderate and maximize efficiency. Retain nodes 1, 2, 3 for fixed and load locations; position two upper nodes for short members above base, forming two triangles transmitting load from node_3 to both supports. Remove unnecessary central/intermediate nodes (node_6). Assign minimum necessary areas (areas \'2\' or \'3\' near anticipated high-force regions, \'1\' or \'0\' elsewhere) to balance stress/mass. All nodes are part of closed network. This configuration will check both constraints.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A Warren truss, with two upper nodes (placing node_4 midway, node_5 above node_2), ensures all load paths are triangulated, minimizing unsupported spans and distributing the inclined load efficiently. Large central spans are avoided. Minimum area members are used except where greater force is likely—typically in diagonals closest to load and supports. By trimming the node count and reducing high-redundancy members, structure mass is cut significantly. Compact node placement further shortens member length. This should yield a design that is both closed and optimal within constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: (i) Maximum force is at members directly connecting node_3 (load) to near nodes. (ii) All-force paths must close (i.e., triangles everywhere). Node_1: (0,0), node_2: (6,0), node_3: (2,0) fixed. Place node_4 above node_3 at (3.15,2.5) and node_5 above node_2 at (6.0,2.0) to keep upper members shorter and triangulation efficient. Compute member lengths, assign areas: \'3\' for diagonals from node_3, \'2\' for upper chords near nodes 4-5; \'1\' for chords between node_1-3 and node_2-3. Reject node_6 from previous structure as unnecessary.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Compute truss member lengths and estimate mass:\\\n    - Member_1: node_1-node_2, area \'1\', length 6.00, mass=6.0*0.195=1.17\\\n    - Member_2: node_1-node_3, area \'1\', length 2.00, mass=2.00*0.195=0.39\\\n    - Member_3: node_2-node_3, area \'1\', length 4.00, mass=4.00*0.195=0.78\\\n    - Member_4: node_1-node_4, area \'2\', length=√((3.15)^2+(2.5)^2)=4.03, mass=4.03*0.782=3.15\\\n    - Member_5: node_3-node_4, area \'3\', length=√((1.15)^2+(2.5)^2)=2.75, mass=2.75*1.759=4.84\\\n    - Member_6: node_2-node_5, area \'2\', length=√((0)^2+(2.0)^2)=2.00, mass=2.00*0.782=1.56\\\n    - Member_7: node_5-node_4, area \'2\', length=√((2.85)^2+(0.5)^2)=2.89, mass=2.89*0.782=2.26\\\n    - Member_8: node_3-node_5, area \'3\', length=√((4.0)^2+(2.0)^2)=4.47, mass=4.47*1.759=7.86\\\n    - Member_9: node_4-node_2, area \'1\', length=√((2.85)^2+(2.5)^2)=3.79, mass=3.79*0.195=0.74\\\n    Total mass=1.17+0.39+0.78+3.15+4.84+1.56+2.26+7.86+0.74=22.75 (well within 30 limit).
