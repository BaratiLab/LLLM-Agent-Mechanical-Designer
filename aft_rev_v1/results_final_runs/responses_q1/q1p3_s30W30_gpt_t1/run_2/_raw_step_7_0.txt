The current and historical designs violate the maximum stress constraint (|σ| ≤ 30) and sometimes the mass constraint (mass ≤ 30). Objective: redesign or adjust the truss so both constraints are fully satisfied, all nodes are well connected (closed truss), and stress/mass are minimized.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "A truss connects node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 (load input, -10kN at -45°), and two elevated nodes. Prior designs overly loaded some members (usually members between node_3 and node_1), exceeding |σ|max=30. Masses were often efficient, but load paths induced excessive forces in nearly direct members. The structure must ensure efficient load diffusion, probably adding triangulation/support between elevated nodes, and using larger cross section where required.",\n\n    "analysis": "Examining both current and historical structures:\\n- Current design: max stress -36.21 (fails constraint), mass 19.1 (passes)\\n- Most historic constraint-satisfying examples had low stress but at high mass (∼31–54), due to excessive members or over-conservative sizing.\\n- Best trade-off in rank_1: σ_max=20.81, mass=21.1 (passes both constraints)\\n\\nIssues in current design:\\n- Direct connections (node_3 ↔ node_1) over-concentrate force and create high stresses.\\n- The configuration isn\'t ideally triangulated near node_3, leading to stress spikes.\\n- The best historic structure (rank_1) uses moderate member areas (1,2,3) and better top-chord triangulation. This keeps force diffusion broad and avoids extremely stressed members. It likely satisfies all closed-connection criteria.\\n\\nEfficient triangulation between upper nodes (node_4, node_5) and using strong enough members for major force paths is crucial.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "The optimal structure features:\\n- Both top nodes well triangulated.\\n- No member between node_3 and node_1/2 with minimal cross-section.\\n- If member sizes are increased in \'dangerous\' members (past high stress), mass increases. The best is utilizing the structure from rank_1, which already meets both constraints and is highly efficient.",\n\n    "proposal": "Select the structure from history/rank_1, as it achieves σ_max=20.81 (<30) and mass=21.1 (<30), and features a closed triangulated form with robust connections. This structure is closer to optimal than newly improvising from less efficient current or overly conservative constraint_not_met examples. All supports and loaded nodes remain fixed as per instruction. Minor refinements: Slightly adjust top node (node_5) position for even better stress distribution if needed, but prioritize keeping coordinates as in rank_1 for proven compliance.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Rank_1 structure uses optimized member sizing and geometry for efficient force path triangulation from load at node_3 to both supports. All nodes are included, creating a closed truss. Member cross-sectional areas are balanced, and significant load paths are not oversized nor under-designed. This design exploits angles so member forces transmit with lower axial stress, achieving both low mass and stress constraints.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions:\\n- Nodal forces are quasi-static, with no significant out-of-plane moments.\\n- Stress in each member is force/(area*length), so σ ∝ F/A.\\n- High-stress members (near node_3, node_4, node_5) are provided with higher area (id=3).\\n\\nEquilibrium: ΣF_x=ΣF_y=0, moments at supports handled by triangulation.\\n\\nCalculation:\\n- Use given member areas from area_id.\\n- Mass=sum(length*area).\\n- Confirm all members ≤30MPa.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Rank_1\'s structure achieves:\\n- Total mass = 21.1 (satisfies ≤30).\\n- Max stress = 20.8 (satisfies |σ|≤30).\\n- All members are triangulated around loaded node and supports.\\n\\nNo node or member is isolated. Each member area is aligned to ensure the highest loaded members (near node_4/node_5) are given largest area_id, rest moderate (id=2) or minimal near lower stress zones (id=1).\\n- Node coordinates and areas used are validated against prior results.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Structure fully complies: mass and stress within constraint, all nodes (including supports and load) are preserved and not relocated, member connectivity is closed and triangulated, and no node is orphaned.
