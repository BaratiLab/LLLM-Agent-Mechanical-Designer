The existing design(s) violate constraints on maximum stress (must be within ±30) and total mass (must be ≤30). Objective: deliver a structure that meets both constraints while achieving global force equilibrium and robust closure, minimizing material use and stress.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives: All stresses ≤30, mass ≤30. All nodes must be structurally connected without isolation. Given history shows typical designs either overstressed (~9-54 MPa) or overweight. Node and member placement and section choice must coordinate geometry and force path with area selection.",\n\n    "analysis": "Existing structures distribute load from node_3 to supports via a set of triangularized connections. Frequent constraint failures are from excessive member stress near node_3 or over-designed heavy main chords. Mass overruns often originate from oversize main horizontal chords or superfluous diagonal bracing. Designs with 6 nodes or more and judicious use of relatively small cross-sections trend toward constraint satisfaction but still run heavy. Load is at node_3 (2.0, 0.0) in a steep downward/leftward direction; this calls for robust bracing to both supports and redundancy for closure. Both supports are fixed at (0,0) and (6,0) respectively: boundary nodes cannot move. Previous dense triangulations overshot mass, while minimalist designs became overstressed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangle-based, direct-load-path designs trend overweight unless area IDs are reduced. Diagonals close to force lines help stress distribution but risk overloading or require excessive area. Historical poor performance suggests a new triangulation to achieve closure with fewer, shorter, and more efficiently-aligned members. \'node_4\', \'node_5\', \'node_6\' can be tuned in position and number.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign: Use 5 nodes (3 fixed: node_1 @ (0,0), node_2 @ (6,0), node_3 @ (2,0, load-applied), plus 2 elevated apex nodes). Place these two new apexes above each support, creating two triangulated panels converging at node_3. Leaning these apexes toward node_3 distributes the load efficiently and closes the truss, shortening critical members while improving both mass and stress outcomes. Remove low-utility members, use area_id \'1\' for horizontal chords (where previous overstress was never an issue) and area_id \'2\' or \'3\' for select diagonals near node_3.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Symmetry about the load insertion point (node_3) allows balanced force transmission into both supports, minimizing moment arms and reducing peak member forces. Angling apex nodes above each support enables short, direct diagonals to node_3, controlling maximum stress while keeping panel size small enough to use lower area IDs. Full closure is achieved by connecting apexes as well. Members connecting node_3 to each apex, apexes to adjacent supports, supports across the base, and apexes together form two stiff, braced triangles. Area IDs are chosen to keep high-force members strong enough, panels light.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume member axes: min length, direct load path from node_3 to each support via apex; secondary members for closure only. Node_4 at (1.1,2.5) (over node_1), node_5 at (4.8,1.9) (over node_2), both slightly closer to node_3 for weight saving. Use Law of Sines/Cosines for member lengths and geometry. Loads divert through apex diagonals, max forces occur in node_3-to-apex and (occasionally) apex-to-support members. Target area_ids: diagonals = \'3\' or \'2\', horizontals and closure = \'1\'. Total member length estimate: 14-18 units approx. (each diagonal ≈2.6-3.0, closure ≈2.5-4.0, base ≈6.0). Chosen areas keep total mass under 30; stress in heaviest loaded members stays under 25 with geometric arrangement. All nodes fully connected.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node positions: node_1=(0.0,0.0), node_2=(6.0,0.0), node_3=(2.0,0.0), node_4=(1.1,2.5), node_5=(4.8,1.9).
