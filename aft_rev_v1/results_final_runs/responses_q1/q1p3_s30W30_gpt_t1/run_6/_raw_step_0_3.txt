Goal: All nodes must form a closed (triangulated) structure, max |stress| ≤ 30, total mass ≤ 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "We have three nodes: two supports (pinned at node_1, roller at node_2), and the loaded node_3. Need a closed/effective truss (all nodes connected, minimal mass) that spreads a -10 kN, -45° force at node_3 efficiently without exceeding stress limit. Areas are discrete (area_id set). Design must triangulate, as three nodes only support a triangle. Triangulation is mandatory for a closed, determinate truss with three nodes.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 is -10 kN at -45°. The span is 6m between node_1 and node_2, node_3 is between them. Structure must transmit the load in both x and y via axial forces only (truss assumption). Basic closed truss here is a triangle: members node_1-node_2, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3. All must be present (closed). Key failure is member overstress (|σ| > 30), or over-mass (mass > 30). With only three nodes, new nodes don\'t add value unless for increased stability, but constraints and length penalty suggest triangle is optimal minimal mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangle between the three given nodes is statically determinate, closed, and transfers load directly. Optimal stresses will occur if the area is chosen correctly (small as possible to minimize mass, but large enough to keep stress ≤ 30). Members\' lengths calculable via distance formula. Member direction cosines allow resolution of forces from node_3\'s diagonal load.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "The closed triangle is optimal for this three-point problem. Members: node_1-node_2 (bottom chord), node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3 (diagonals). Assign minimal allowable area_ids that keep member stresses within ±30. Direct, short members reduce mass. No new nodes needed—the original configuration is most efficient.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Steps: 1) Compute lengths: node_1-node_2: 6.00m; node_1-node_3: 2.00m; node_2-node_3: 4.00m. 2) Assign initial smallest available areas. 3) Calculate member forces by solving static equilibrium at node_3. 4) Compute required area for each so that |force/area| ≤ 30. 5) Compute mass: sum(length*area). Iteratively increase area as needed but minimize mass. All members must use area from discrete set. Stress = force/area.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Let’s denote (x,y) for force calculations:\\n\\nnode_1: (0.0, 0.0), node_2: (6.0, 0.0), node_3: (2.0, 0.0)\\nMembers: m1 (node_1-node_2): length = 6.00m; m2 (node_1-node_3): length = 2.00m; m3 (node_2-node_3): length = 4.00m\\n\\nAt node_3, load is (-10, -45°): F_x = -10*cos(45°) = -7.071, F_y = -7.071\\n\\nLet T23 (member node_2-node_3), T13 (node_1-node_3)\\nAngles:\\nnode_1-node_3: horizontal (to right), m2: (2,0): direction vector (2,0), props (1,0)\\nnode_2-node_3: vector (4,0): (6-2,0) = (4,0), props (1,0)\\n\\nBut nodes 1,2,3 all colinear. This suggests the third node is colinear: creates a degenerate triangle (line), which cannot carry vertical load via truss action. To close and stiffen, a new node must be introduced. We can add node_4 at (2.0, 2.0), directly above node_3. This provides vertical stiffness and allows a triangulated system. \\n\\nNew members: node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4\\n\\nNow, with node_4 at (2.0, 2.0), truss will be closed and triangulated.

Even at F=10, stress = 10/0.195=51.3 > 30, so minimum area per chord: For F=10, min area = 10/30 = 0.334. Closest is 0.782 (\'2\'). Use area \'2\' for n3-n4, rest at area \'1\'. Total mass = (4.83*0.195 + 2*0.782)=0.94+1.564=2.5. Well below max mass. All other stresses lower.
