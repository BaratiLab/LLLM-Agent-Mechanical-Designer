The current design is already feasible with a max(abs(stress)) of 13.33 and a mass of 15.78. The node and member layout are provided, including load, support, and area data. The objective is to further reduce stresses where possible and confirm optimality.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given structure: symmetric 5-node truss with one main load at node_3 (-10kN @ -45°), supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller), and closed triangulated shape with internal diagonals. The design already satisfies stress and mass constraints. All elements use reasonable area choices from discrete set. Objective is to lower max(abs(stress)), esp. in member_1, which currently nearly governs.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The load is applied to node_3 on the bottom chord, which is shared with pinned (node_1) and roller (node_2) supports. The force at -45° places both x and y forces at node_3, with reactions split between both supports. Current member layout forms double-triangle plus vertical (node_3-node_5) and internal bracing (node_4). This is already close to optimal for stress minimization as the triangles and diagonals provide efficient load path. All mass and stress values well within constraints; member_1 is the most highly loaded (-13.33). Design history shows a previous, lighter structure with severe overstress, confirming need for this closed, triangulated shape. Further optimization is marginal, but small tuning of member sections may reduce stresses further.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Pattern: Members on bottom chord (esp. member_1) take the bulk of compressive load due to the eccentric load at node_3. The diagonal layouts help distribute force. Other members show moderate but safe stresses. Member_1 uses area_id \'2\'; larger areas for bottom chord may slightly reduce stress but would increase mass. All area allocations balance mass vs. stress well. Node positioning is optimal for supporting the given external load and boundary conditions; further movement risks instability or more mass. All nodes contribute to load path; structure is single connected and closed.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Retain current node positions and connections, as geometric configuration is highly effective and any drastic changes likely worsen stability, weight, or stress. Perform a fine-tuning of member areas: specifically, increase bottom chord (member_1) area from \'2\' to \'3\' (from 0.782 to 1.759) to lower its stress and distribute force slightly more, and decrease over-sized diagonals where possible if these have excess capacity. Leave all other members as in current design since their stresses are already low. This will further reduce max(abs(stress)) while likely incurring minimal mass penalty, keeping total well below 30 units.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "The current design uses symmetric, triangulated load paths and member allocation based on expected force magnitudes under the given loading and supports. Increasing the area of critical, most-stressed member (member_1) will reduce its stress most directly, using available mass allowance efficiently. Reducing oversize in less loaded members can compensate this added mass. Geometric node relocation is not pursued, as supports and load nodes are fixed, and geometry already yields optimal force flows for a pin-jointed truss. Closed structure, no members or nodes are isolated.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Key calculation is stress in member_1 after area upsize: stress = force/area; previously: -13.3292 for area_id \'2\' (0.782), so force ≈ -13.3292*0.782 ≈ -10.42 units. New stress if area = 1.759: -10.42/1.759 ≈ -5.93, much improved. This should lower max(abs(stress)) to member_6 or member_3 (-8.53 and -6.92 with area_id 1 and 2; may further optimize here). Member_3 and member_6 could swap down areas if loads allow. Mass increases for member_1: length × Δarea. All other major stress members are safe. Estimated new total mass: current mass + (extra area of member_1 × length of member_1) - (any savings). Confirm all remain <30.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member_1 (node_1-node_3): length = 2.0, old area = 0.782, new area = 1.759, Δarea = 0.977. Mass increase: 2.0 × 0.977 = 1.954. New total mass ≈ 15.78 + 1.95 = 17.73 (still far below 30). New max(abs(stress)) will be in member_6: force = -8.5284 × 0.195 = -1.663, stress after possible area upgrade: try increasing member_6 area from \'1\' (0.195) to \'2\' (0.782), new stress: -1.663/0.782 ≈ -2.13. Mass increase: member_6 length ~2.0, Δarea = 0.587, Δmass = 1.17. New mass ≈ 18.9. Now max(abs(stress)) remains member_3: -6.9156; area 2 is reasonable. Stop after these targeted area upgrades.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "All nodes are retained; only area selection is fine-tuned on most highly stressed members. All stresses drop below 8, nearly halved; mass remains far under 30, at ~18.9. Geometry is unchanged and remains closed, all members and nodes participate in a single connected structure. No further significant mass or stress improvements can be made without overdesign. Optimization is complete.",\n    \n    "stop": "True",  # No further realistic optimization possible: all constraints met, load path optimal, mass and stress well below limits.
