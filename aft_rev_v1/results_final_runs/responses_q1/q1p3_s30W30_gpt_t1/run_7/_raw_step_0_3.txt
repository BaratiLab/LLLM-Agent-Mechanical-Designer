The structure must minimize maximum member stress (both tension and compression must be ≤ 30) and keep total mass ≤ 30, while withstanding a 10-unit force applied at node_3 at -45°. Supports are at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller). Optimality is achieved via force path triangulation and careful section area selection.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes form a nearly colinear base (nodes 1, 2, 3), with node 3 between 1 and 2. Loading at node 3 is strong and diagonal, implying need for efficient force paths. Closed, fully connected structure means all must be linked in one closed truss, likely a triangle. Efficient stress distribution and minimal mass require optimal area selection and shortest member paths.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The main load is a diagonal (-10 at -45°) at node_3, tending to push/pull both supports (nodes 1,2). Node positions: node_1 (0,0), node_3 (2,0), node_2 (6,0). Pinned at node_1 (resists X/Y), roller at node_2 (resists Y only). The simplest closed structure is a triangle: connect all three nodes. Since the nodes are colinear on X, triangle must be out-of-plane or done by adding a new node. Per instruction, new nodes allowed. Adding one above base improves structural efficiency (e.g., at (2,2)). Triangulated structure distributes loads, minimizes stress per structural mechanics. Large forces warrant strong areas on loaded edges.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Observations: If only existing nodes used, a triangle can\'t be formed without colinearity causing instability; so at least one new node (above) is needed. Optimal Y position maximizes lever arm for vertical component, aiding force balance and reducing stress. Triangulate between supports and loaded node, as well as to new apex. Area selection must balance stress and mass. All three base nodes must be included and not moved.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulate by adding a single new node above the base to form a robust triangle, then form diagonals. Connect each base node to the apex and to each other. Optimal position of new node is symmetrically above node_3, at (2.0, h). A moderate height (h ≈ 2.0) gives good load path without excessive member length. Distribute the load from node_3 upward and then to the supports via the apex. Select largest area at most loaded member (node_3 to apex) and smallest at less critical (pinned/roller connection) for mass minimization.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumption: New node4 at (2.0,2.0). Members: (1-3), (2-3), (1-4), (2-4), (3-4). For load at node_3, main force path is up to apex then down to supports. Forces are balanced in truss triangle. Use method of joints to estimate. Member lengths: (1-3)=2.0, (2-3)=4.0, (3-4)=2.0, (1-4)=sqrt(8)=2.83, (2-4)=sqrt(16+4)=4.47. Assign area_ids to meet σ ≤ 30 and mass ≤ 30. Estimate forces on each member: expect largest in (3-4) and (1-4)/(2-4).
