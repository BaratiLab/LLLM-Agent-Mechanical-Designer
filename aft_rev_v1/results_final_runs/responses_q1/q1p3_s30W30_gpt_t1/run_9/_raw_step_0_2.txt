The objective is to design a fully closed truss using any triangle/quad arrangement (additional nodes allowed) to minimize maximum member stress (±30 max) and keep total mass ≤ 30, selecting cross-sections from a discrete set.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes form a horizontal base (node_1, node_2) with a third node (node_3) also on the x-axis between them. The loaded node is not at a truss \'apex\', so the structure needs triangulation. Full connectivity requires members linking all nodes and possibly adding a new node for an efficient load path to resist the angled load.",\n\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 is downward left (-10.0, -45°), meaning both horizontal and vertical components. node_1 (pinned) is fully fixed, node_2 (roller) only vertical constraint. Direct triangle using current nodes leads to a very shallow structure, poor load resistance in vertical direction, and high stress. Closing the truss with a top node (apex above node_3) to form an improved triangle increases vertical height, optimizes load flow, and allows more efficient member sizing. All nodes must be in a single structure.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Conventional 3-node triangle is ineffective (flat). Introducing a new apex above node_3, and connecting all nodes as a quadrilateral with diagonals, yields two strong triangles. Position apex vertically above node_3 for symmetry and shortest load path. Cross-section selection: prioritize high-stress members for larger area, minimize total mass using smallest possible elsewhere. All members must be checked with estimated forces.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 2.5), vertically above node_3, forming two strong triangles: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_2-node_3-node_4. Add all perimeter and necessary diagonal members so all nodes are closed. Estimated vertical height (2.5) based on typical rise/run for good triangular stiffness while minimizing member length. Optimal connectivity gives high vertical stiffness, efficient force paths to supports. Assign area_id values based on estimated force in each member.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: E = 1 (relative), unit density, area in units per area_id mapping. Calculations: 1. Decompose external load into x/y: 10*cos(45) ≈ 7.07 in -x and -y. 2. Analyze force in vertical (node_3-node_4), bottom chords, and diagonals via method of joints: Node_3 loaded at (2.0,0). Members: node_1-node_2, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4. 3. Estimate longest/stressed members (vertical, bottom), assign larger cross-section where needed. 4. Calculate member lengths, forces, stresses, and total mass.",\n\n    "calculation": "Added vertical member node_3-node_4 with area_id=\'4\' (area=3.128), as it\'s under direct load. Top chords (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4) angle ≈ 45°, both share part of vertical/horizontal components. Bottom chord (node_1-node_2) carries less force due to geometry, so area_id=\'1\' (area=0.195). Diagonals (node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3): area_id=\'2\' (0.782). Lengths: node_3-node_4: 2.5; node_1-node_4: sqrt(2^2+2.5^2)=3.20; node_2-node_4: sqrt(4^2+2.5^2)=4.72; node_1-node_2: 6.0; node_1-node_3: 2.0; node_2-node_3: 4.0. Total mass: 2.5*3.128 + 3.20*1.759 + 4.72*1.759 + 6.0*0.195 + 2.0*0.782 + 4.0*0.782= 7.82 + 5.63 + 8.30 + 1.17 + 1.56 + 3.13 = 27.61 < 30.
