The objective is minimizing max(abs(stress)) and total mass, ensuring all member stresses remain within ±30 and total mass ≤ 30, using only approved cross-sectional areas. The current/previous iterations either exceeded stress or used excessive mass so a new, efficient layout is needed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs clarify objectives: limit max stress <= 30, total mass <= 30, maximize truss efficiency under load at node_3. Prior attempts: iterative use of midspan/top-chord nodes and various area combinations. Node and support positions are fixed by boundary and loading requirements.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current design has stress violation: member_5 carries 30.96, slightly over limit. Previous historic structure stayed within stress (max=12.3), but mass was high (27.6). Attempts used additional nodes to enhance triangulation and force distribution, but extra nodes increased total mass. Key problem: with node_3 as load point between supports, efficient transfer requires robust diagonal and reduced redundancy. Efficient closed forms (triangulated) yield lower stress but mass quickly grows if cross sections aren\'t minimized. Members between supports and loading point must carry the main forces. Nodes at y=2.5 appear to assist force spreading but can be fine-tuned for shortest structural paths and minimal overlap. Past members demonstrate diminishing returns with overcomplexity.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Pattern: Adding upper nodes (node_4, node_5) improves stress distribution, but only helps if node positions and member areas are well-chosen. Avoid undersizing top chords (which increase compressive/tensile stress). Deleting less-critical members may reduce mass, but too few could increase stress. Plan: minimize upper chord height and material by reducing y of upper nodes, focus on triangles from supports through node_3 to top chord.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign to retain triangulation but minimize mass: Keep node_3 as load node, retain supports as prescribed. Place two top nodes, node_4 and node_5, but move them closer (y ≈ 1.75 instead of 2.5) and center them above node_3 (between node_1 and node_2, at x ≈ 2 and 4). This shortens top chords and diagonals, reducing mass. Connect: base nodes (node_1, node_2, node_3), each top node (node_4, node_5), fully triangulate. Use area_id=\'2\' or \'1\' for less-stressed members, \'3\' for main diagonals. Avoid large areas, prioritize direct force path.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Main load travels from node_3 diagonally to supports. By lowering the height and spacing of node_4 and node_5, paths are shorter and mass reduced. Optimization favors two main triangles anchored at node_3; full connectivity ensures no isolated nodes. Members from supports to top nodes, from top nodes to node_3, and a top chord — all short, efficient. Use symmetry from supports to top nodes for even load distribution. Appropriate selection of member areas is essential: minimum possible for each force path but increased where main load is channeled.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Unit material density; axial forces dominate. Stress = Force / Area. Mass = length × area. For diagonals (from support to top node), estimate force as sum of vertical and horizontal reactions from load (10 kN at -45° = 7.07 kN vertical/horizontal). Expected max member force ≈ 14.1 kN (diagonal). Use area_id=\'2\' (0.782) for main diagonals/top chord, area_id=\'1\' (0.195) for bracing/shorter members. Height of top chord set so diagonal length ≈ 2.5-2.8 m. Add base chord (node_1 to node_2), diagonals (supports to node_5/4), braces (node_3 to top nodes), and top chord (node_4 to node_5).
