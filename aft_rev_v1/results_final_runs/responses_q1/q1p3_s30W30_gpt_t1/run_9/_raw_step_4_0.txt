The aim is to generate a closed, optimized 2D truss that connects all nodes, distributes stresses efficiently, and maintains total mass ≤30, while keeping all member stresses within [-30, 30]. Support and load nodes/positions are fixed, but geometry and cross-sections can be optimized.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: generate a 2D truss spanning 6\u202fm, with pinned and roller supports at each end (nodes 1 and 2) and a concentrated force at node_3. Constraints: max member stress ≤30, total mass ≤30. Loads/supplies: node_3 (-10kN at -45°); supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Failure in the last iteration is due to excess compressive tension in member_8. Closed truss means all nodes are structurally connected. High-stress members need either a larger area or path modification.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Examining the history, best prior solution (\'rank_1\') was robust but far heavier (mass=27.6, max_stress=12.3) due to large cross sections. The current design used slimmer areas but suffered from severe stress concentration: member_8, spanning node_1-node_3 (the load introduction node), took most of the force in a single short direct member, creating high stress. Members are mostly horizontal and vertical, with two top chords (nodes 4 and 5 at y=1.75) forming two triangles above the supports and load. However, the truss depth is small (1.75\u202fm), limiting lever arm and hence increasing stress. Increasing area in highly stressed members helps, but does not resolve the stress/mass trade-off at optimum. The pattern across history: deeper top chords (like in rank_1) minimize max stress but drive up mass. Lateral expansion (wider base/top) helps to reduce member forces but adds slightly to mass. The recent structure is most weight-efficient but over-stressed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Observation: Members incident to node_3 (especially between node_1 and node_3, and to node_4/top chord nodes) show high compressive/tensile stress. Small top chord depth (short y-displacement) means greater force in those members. Adding top chord depth increases lever arm, reducing member force. Efficient, minimally redundant triangulation reduces stress and mass. Potential improvement: raise the top chord (nodes 4, 5) higher, widen to further distribute load, and optimize member areas only where needed. Ensure closure (all nodes connected, no isolated node). Consider minimal addition: only add a top node if needed for a true triangle closure. Member between nodes 1–4, 2–5, 4–5 (top chord), 4–3, 5–3, 1–3, 2–3 form viable triangles. For a fully triangulated Pratt or modified Warren truss (for point loads off-center), this should distribute the -45°-angled load more evenly.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the structure: Retain node positions for loads/supports (node_1: (0.0,0.0), node_2: (6.0,0.0), node_3: (2.0,0.0)), but reconfigure the top chord for a deeper, narrower configuration to minimize max stress. Move nodes_4 and _5 to (2.0,2.5) and (4.0,2.5) for a standard triangular load path, and ensure all connections triangulate the span. Adjust member areas such that only the most stressed members use thicker cross-sections. Exhibit symmetry for efficient load sharing. Ensure all nodes are in at least two members for closure. Remove unnecessary members that may cause redundant high force paths.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By increasing the height of top chord nodes (y=2.5\u202fm), we provide a larger lever arm for the truss to resolve the downward-angled load at node_3. Connecting node_3 upwards to nodes_4 and _5, forming a strong triangle, allows the load to be distributed over more members. Symmetrically connecting 1-4, 1-3, 3-4, 2-5, 3-5, 4-5, 1-2 ensures a closed, statically determinate system with force flow balance. Avoid overly redundant or poorly triangulated layouts (which can drive up either stress or weight). Assign the largest permissible area to the member with max expected force (node_1–node_3, node_3–node_4), reduce cross-section elsewhere, and retain overall low mass by optimizing critical member allocation.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All loads and geometry in meters and kilonewtons. Material yield strength not given, but stress constraint is ±30. For force calculations: For -10\u202fkN at node_3 at -45°, the horizontal/vertical force components: Fx= -10*cos(45°)= -7.07kN, Fy= -7.07kN. With pinned/roller at nodes 1/2, reactions can be statically determined. The deeper top chord (height=2.5) increases vertical moment arm, thus reducing force in the most direct diagonals (triangle sides from node_3 to top nodes). Max force in member (node_1–node_3) previously was >48\u202fkN; increasing height reduces this to under 30\u202fkN for a triangle truss. Use area_id \'4\' (3.128) for diagonals and bottom chord where force is highest, area_id \'1\' (0.195) for verticals/top chord where stress is lowest from previous member_stress outputs.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Estimate member lengths: 1-2: 6; 1-4: sqrt(2^2 + 2.5^2)=3.20; 4-5: 2.0; 5-2: sqrt(2^2+2.5^2)=3.20. 1-3: 2; 3-2: 4; 3-4: sqrt(0^2+2.5^2)=2.5; 3-5: sqrt(2^2+2.5^2)=3.20.

Try assigning \'2\' (0.782) for diagonals, \'1\' (0.195) for low-force members, and \'3\' (1.759) to key bottom chords. Mass: (6*1.759)+(12.1*0.782)+2*0.195 = 10.554 + 9.472+ 0.39 = 20.42.
