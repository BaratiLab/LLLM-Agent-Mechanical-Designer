The current design exceeds the minimum possible maximum stress among history (current: 24.2 vs. historical minimum: 12.3), suggesting room for major improvement.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Review revealed that the current truss achieves constraint satisfaction, but is significantly less efficient (max_stress 24.2) compared to the best in history (12.3). Geometry and member layouts in history indicate superior stress distribution possible with a tall trapezoidal or quadrilateral geometry, triangulated, with strategically thickened members at high-stress locations.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The applied load is -10 kN at -45°, targeting node_3. Supports are pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2, both on y = 0. Current structure is a 5-node, 7-member polygon with two near-horizontal chords and short verticals/diagonals. Top stress is found in the diagonal (member_6, -24.20) and secondary diagonal (member_7, -17.09), both under compression. However, historical structure \'rank_1\', a tall single-triangle on node_4, gives almost half the max stress (12.3) at higher mass (27.6). History shows increasing top chord height or additional triangulation above node_3 (with or without node_5), lowers stress but trade-offs on weight must be balanced. All designs keep lower chord between node_1–node_2 pinned/roller, which should not shift.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Targeting a trapezoid or a triangular arrangement with a high apex above node_3 should create more direct force paths. The best structure in history uses triangle apex (node_4 at [2.0, 2.5]), but higher mass than current. Compression in the current diagonals is a typical failure mode and indicates excessive force concentration. Using a single central apex and symmetric triangulation can both lower peak stresses and use fewer over-stressed thin members. Members between supports and applied load should have largest areas, side triangles can go thinner.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the structure using the configuration of \'rank_1\' history ([2.0, 2.5] apex, 4-node, 6-member triangle plus base arrangement), but tune member areas to ensure all stresses are < 13 (to minimize max stress), with areas not oversized unless necessary. This arrangement has demonstrated the best performance in history and creates shortest, straightest load paths. Discard node_5 and all non-essential members. Main load paths (pins at nodes 1/2, apex at node_4, all sides connected plus vertical from node_3 to apex). Adjust area selections: main triangle sides and vertical to apex get largest needed area, rest as thin as acceptable.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulated shapes (especially with tall apex above load node) perform best in truss optimization — direct load path from load to both supports, distributing forces efficiently and lowering peak stresses. Fewer nodes/members also means less redundant mass. By removing side node_5 and tuning member areas, we can ensure mass and stress constraints are both met, minimizing ‘over-building’ and redistributing stress away from slender diagonals.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Check previous best geometry: node_1 [0,0], node_2 [6,0], node_3 [2,0], node_4 [2,2.5]. Members: base (node_1-node_2), two sides to apex, two supports from node_1/node_2 to node_3, vertical to apex. Assign areas: for members with highest compression/tension (members to apex, base), use area_id \'3\' (1.759), for least loaded, \'1\' (0.195). Use stress ratio from history to confirm: stress~12.3 at max (area \'2\'), so increase to area \'3\' if needed for margin.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Estimate member lengths: node_1-node_2 (6.0); node_1-node_3 (2.0); node_2-node_3 (4.0); node_3-node_4 (2.5); node_1-node_4=sqrt((2.0)^2+(2.5)^2)=3.20; node_2-node_4=sqrt((4.0)^2+(2.5)^2)=4.72. Given historical member stresses (~6-12), and max stress/weight ratio of 0.445, assign area \'1\' for base, area \'3\' for main sides, \'4\' for vertical if needed. Confirm mass sum: 6.0×0.195 + 2.0×0.782 + 4.0×0.782 + 2.5×3.128 + 3.20×1.759 + 4.72×1.759 ≈ 1.17 + 1.564 + 3.128 + 7.82 + 5.63 + 8.29 = 27.6. All values within constraint bounds. All member stresses will decrease with up-selection to \'3\'/’4’ if needed — history shows all ±13 or less.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Geometric configuration and area selection proven best by historical structure. All constraints (stress < 30, mass < 30) amply satisfied. Structure is closed, all nodes connected, no floats/isolated nodes, uses only essential members.
