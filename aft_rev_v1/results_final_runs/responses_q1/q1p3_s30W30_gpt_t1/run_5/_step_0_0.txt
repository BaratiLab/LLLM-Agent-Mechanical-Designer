    "preamble": "Given fixed pins and a concentrated load, we aim to synthesize a light, stress-safe, fully closed 2D truss. The optimized structure must endure the load at node_3 without exceeding ±30 stress and a total mass of 30 units, using only prescribed areas and nodes (with new nodes if necessary).",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "We have three initial nodes: 'node_1' (pinned), 'node_2' (roller), and 'node_3' (load application, mid-span). Stress must be ≤30 in compression/tension, mass ≤30. All nodes must be included; full triangulation is advisable for stability. Connection between all nodes and a closure using one auxiliary node for triangulation/force diversion is anticipated.",
    
    "analysis": "The geometry forms a nearly straight line. The applied load at 'node_3' will create high bending moments if only a linear member is used. Loads need to be redirected to supports by creating strong triangular paths. Optionally, an apex node above 'node_3' (to create two robust triangles) drastically improves force flow and provides a closed structure. The direct connection from node_3 to both supports is critical, but another node above (say, node_4) will allow us to distribute the load vertically and reduce member stresses.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Given geometric positions, a single triangle is insufficient; the truss, to be closed, must have at least four nodes. An additional node atop node_3 will provide nearly isosceles triangles, reduce bending, and ensure all members are efficient (axial). Connect all nodes in a ring (quad), with both diagonals (truss closure) so every node is included. Area selection will target minimal stress, especially in high-force members.",
    
    "reasoning": "Introduce node_4 directly above node_3 at a height that provides best angle for force separation. Connect node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, and node_1-node_2 (base). This forms two triangles with a vertical above node_3 and triangulation. Typical span height ratios (e.g., height/span=1/3 to 1/2) are efficient; I'll pick y=2.0 above node_3 for good force sharing without excessive member length. Area selection will prioritize the two diagonals and the vertical, as they see highest forces.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Let node_4 = (2.0, 2.0). Calculate all member lengths by distance formula. Assign large area_id ('2', 0.782) to diagonals node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, and vertical (node_3-node_4); assign smallest ('1', 0.195) to horizontal/shortest members as they see less stress. Apply joint equilibrium at node_3 for the applied load (-10 in -45 deg). Estimate required area based on max force: F = stress × area, so area >= |Fmax|/30. Calculate total mass as sum(length × area). Total six members suffice for a robust triangulated quad.",
    
    "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0; node_3-node_2 = 4.0; node_1-node_4 = sqrt(8) ≈ 2.83; node_2-node_4 = sqrt((6-2)^2+2^2)=sqrt(16+4)=sqrt(20)=4.47; node_3-node_4 = 2.0 (vertical); node_1-node_2 = 6.0. Initial force path puts most force on node_3-node_4 and two diagonals. Estimate max force on vertical and diagonals as up to 10 (from the load), so area needs to be at least 10/30 = 0.33. area_id '2' is 0.782, sufficient. Other members are heavily understressed; use area_id '1' (0.195). Check mass: 2.0×0.195 + 4.0×0.195 + 2.83×0.782 + 4.47×0.782 + 2.0×0.782 + 6.0×0.195 = 0.39+0.78+2.21+3.50+1.56+1.17= 9.61 < 30. Stresses estimated max: force/area, so 10/0.782 ≈ 12.8 < 30. All constraints satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Final nodes: node_1: (0.0, 0.0), node_2: (6.0, 0.0), node_3: (2.0, 0.0), node_4: (2.0, 2.0). Six members: node_1-node_3 ('1'), node_3-node_2 ('1'), node_1-node_4 ('2'), node_2-node_4 ('2'), node_3-node_4 ('2'), node_1-node_2 ('1'). Total mass ~9.61, well under constraint. Max member stress ~12.8 < 30. Structure is closed and satisfies all other constraints. All nodes participate, with triangulation for direct load paths. Ready for output.",
