    "preamble": "The problem is to design an optimal, closed 2D truss with specified loads, support conditions, and node locations for supports/loads. The current structures exceed allowable maximum stress (+/-30) and do not provide enough mass efficiency under these constraints. The objective is to minimize mass while keeping all member stresses within ±30 by adjusting connectivity, node positioning (except at support/load nodes), and member areas.",

    "scratch_pad_1": "Given: A single load at node_3 (-10kN @ -45°), pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Nodes at node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (2,2.5). Structure is closed, but exceeds max stress in some members. Current max stress ~31, total mass ~11. Repeat violation in prior candidate. Must close truss, keep support/load node positions, but can adjust other nodes and area selection.",

    "analysis": "Critical observation: Node_3 experiences the load, with two supports spaced horizontally (nodes 1 & 2). Prior failures: member_3 (node_1-node_4) and member_5 (node_2-node_4) are overstressed (moments or direct stress too high). Current triangles are tall and thin, resulting in high force in vertical and diagonal members. Stresses ~31–56kN in some members. Most recent structure used minimal areas in high-stress spots, causing failures. To satisfy all constraints, the structure needs better force distribution, stiffer diagonals (larger sections or shorter lengths), with triangulation below node_3 for improved load path. Mass limit not restrictive with values ~11 so far; stress reduction is priority.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: The vertical arrangement and use of thin triangles (long diagonals) lead to high member forces under off-vertical loading. The structure is not optimally triangulated for out-of-plane shear from the applied angle. Key insight: Lowering node_4 (from y=2.5) to widen/flatten triangle may help, but node_4 is not a support/load node—thus can be moved. Adding a new node to create a polygon with additional triangulation can further reduce member forces. Consider a low-height additional node (node_5) and add connecting diagonals creating more triangles.",

    "proposal": "Redesign. Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed (boundary, supports/loads). Move node_4 lower and slightly right to flatten the truss top chord, reducing diagonal length (less force in member_3/5), and add node_5 above node_3 to form a central triangle. Connect node_5 to node_3 and node_4 (apex). Use sufficient member area where high load is expected (diagonals near the load path). Assign larger cross-section to diagonals, mid-size for shorter members, minimal area for perimeter with lower force estimates.",

    "reasoning": "Key truss design principles: (1) All nodes must be in triangulated, closed polygons for rigidity. (2) Members under major stress (diagonals under off-axis load) need more area. (3) Shorter, more horizontal/flat top chords mean lower force in vertical/diagonals. (4) Adding a node just above/below node_3 provides a triangle near the applied load, thus improving local stiffness. Choosing area_id for each member is based on anticipated force from static analysis (proportional to force projection or simple influence coefficients in classic Pratt/Warren arrangements).",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Support locations fixed, node_3 (load) fixed. Suggest lower node_4 from (2,2.5) to (2.5,1.5) and add node_5 at (2,1.2). Members: all perimeter and crucial diagonals included. Structural force calculation: Resolving -10kN at -45°, transfer is split via diagonals to supports. For 45° loading, nearby diagonals will be highly stressed. Set diagonals to area_id='2'(0.782); vertical/shorter chords: area_id='1'(0.195) to save weight where possible. Calculate: For L=~2, F=10kN/sqrt(2)=~7kN along each diagonal. max_stress=F/A. For A=0.782, stress ~9kN (safe). Perimeter members expected ~4-6kN, stress below 30. Mass sum: each member length (1.5-3m) × selected area, total <15 likely.",

    "calculation": "1. Node positions: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (3.5,1.5), node_5 (2,1.2). 2. Estimated main member lengths: node_3-node_5 (1.2m), node_3-node_4 (1.8m), node_4-node_5 (1.7m). 3. Member areas: Heavier for diagonals connecting load to supports, lighter for less loaded. Mass sum estimation: (e.g., member_1: 2m×0.782 + others ~1-2m×0.195 each), total ~8-12. All estimated member stresses below 30 for these areas. Triangulation fully closes all nodes, removing long unsupported diagonal. All supports/loads at fixed positions. All criteria predicted met.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "Check structure: All nodes connected, full triangulation, no isolated nodes. Area selection avoids overdesign. All member stresses estimated <30. Mass under 30. Node positions maintain fixed for support/load, moved only for intermediate nodes. Output is valid per requirements.",
