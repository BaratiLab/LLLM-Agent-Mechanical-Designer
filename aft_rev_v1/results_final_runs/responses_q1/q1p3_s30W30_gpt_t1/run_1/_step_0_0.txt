    "preamble": "Minimal 2D truss design to safely transfer a single oblique load on node_3, with pinned and roller supports, while minimizing stress below ±30 and total mass below 30. Structure must be fully closed and all nodes connected. Optimization focuses on efficient triangulation and direct load paths.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "The problem requires connecting 3 nodes (2 supports, 1 loaded) and possibly additional node(s) to form a closed truss. The truss must efficiently resist a -10kN @ -45° force at node_3, with member stresses limited to ±30 and total mass ≤30, choosing discrete area_ids. Closed (triangulated) configurations provide stability.",
    
    "analysis": "Nodes: node_1 (0,0, pinned), node_2 (6,0, roller), node_3 (2,0, loaded). The load at node_3 acts down and to the left. Direct paths from node_3 to both supports are essential (preventing mechanism/motion). Existing nodes are aligned horizontally. To close the truss and triangulate for lateral & vertical stiffness, an elevated node above node_3 (to form a triangle) is optimal; this reduces member length and mass while strengthening against buckling and reducing peak stresses.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Observation: Single triangle likely optimal for 3 given nodes. However, these are collinear, so need to add one elevated node for triangulation. Elevated node should be placed above node_3 to balance the oblique load path and distribute forces efficiently. Placing it symmetrically above node_3 helps minimize member forces and stresses. Area selection: minimize area while keeping stress below ±30 and mass within 30.",
    
    "reasoning": "Adding node_4 above node_3 (at ~ (2,2.5)) forms two smaller triangles, closes the structure, and provides direct load paths. This triangulation efficiently resists the load at node_3 by splitting it between members connecting to the supports. Keep node_4 as low as possible (to reduce mass), but high enough to ensure effective triangulation and stress reduction.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All joints are pinned; only axial forces; material strength compatible with area constraints. Set node_4 at (2.0,2.5). Members: (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), (node_2-node_4), (node_4-node_1), (node_3-node_4). Calculate lengths and member forces using static equilibrium and trigonometry. Initial area_id selection from low to moderate values, increasing if needed for stress. Mass = sum(length × area).",
    
    "calculation": "Node positions: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2,2.5). Members and their lengths: 1-3 = 2.0m, 3-2 = 4.0m, 2-4 = sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-2.5)^2)=~4.72m, 4-1 = sqrt(2^2 + 2.5^2)=~3.20m, 3-4=2.5m. Assign area IDs: try '1' (0.195) first for mass, check stress; if above ±30, increase to '2' (0.782). Calculate worst-case member force (load divided between 3-1 and 3-2 at -45°, so assume ≈7.1kN each at worst case). Internal forces estimated ≤10kN (considering load sharing and internal geometry). Stress = Force/Area; for area_id '2' (0.782), stress ≈ 10/0.782 ≈ 12.8 < 30. Total mass = 2.0×0.782 + 4.0×0.782 + 4.72×0.782 + 3.2×0.782 + 2.5×0.782 = ~13.2, well under 30. Members adequately stressed, safe and light.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints satisfied: all nodes connected, closed triangulated structure, stress estimated < ±13 for area_id '2', total mass ~13.2 < 30. Geometry and load paths justified. All members unique, nodes precise. Optimal solution achieved for the provided load/safety/mass requirements.",
