Previous design exceeded the max stress (40.29 > 30) despite a low mass, so constraint satisfaction is the priority.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs: 4 nodes, 6 members, force at node_3 (-10kN at -45°), supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), current failure due to excessive member/max stress. Required: max stress ≤ 30, mass ≤ 30. Node/support/load positions fixed.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure is a single bay with a vertical extension (node_4), but -10kN at node_3, applied at an angle, creates high forces in diagonally aligned members. Exceeding stress occurs at member_2 (40.29, tension), and member_3 also has high stress. This suggests that triangles alone (as in current structure) are insufficient to spread the diagonal load. Previous design history contains no successful patterns, just a single constraint violation.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Stress concentrations occur in diagonals and verticals because of the single bracing plane. More triangles or closed loops may help. Possibility: add a lower chord member (node_1-node_2), and connect all nodes in a fully triangulated pattern. Area assignments were perhaps too small for critical members. Alternatively, node positioning can improve force flow, but cannot move loaded or supported nodes.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign with denser triangulation: ensure every node is part of at least two triangles. Increase member areas for diagonal/critical members to prevent overstressing. Form a closed truss by adding a second upper node for improved force distribution, creating a Warren/Pratt hybrid. Only move node_4; introduce node_5 above node_2 for triangulation. Optimize cross-sectional areas to keep stress < 30 and mass low.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Multiple triangles provide redundancy and reduce the risk of overstressing any one member. A closed truss with nodes_4, _3 (top), connected to both supports via diagonals, and connecting the top chord to a new node_5 (above node_2), gives balanced load paths for the diagonal force at node_3. Assign larger area to most-loaded diagonal members by estimation, smaller on vertical/horizontals. All members close loops, no isolated nodes.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume: Nodes at supports and load are fixed. Place node_4 at (2,1.8) (higher to increase lever arm for top chord), and add node_5 at (4.5,1.2) to form triangles with node_2 and node_3. Create members: node_1-node_2 (bottom), node_2-node_5 (right vertical), node_5-node_4 (top), node_4-node_1 (left), node_4-node_3 (left diag), node_3-node_5 (right diag), node_3-node_2 (lower diagonal). Areas: Diagonals use area_id \'2\' (0.782), chords use \'1\' (0.195), most-loaded diagonals may use \'3\' (1.759). Estimated member forces via equilibrium assuming symmetric configuration and triangle geometry. Calculate total mass and check stresses are beneath 30 (use basic F = σA, F = member force).",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node positions: node_1 (0.0,0.0), node_2 (6.0,0.0), node_3 (2.0,0.0), node_4 (2.0,1.8), node_5 (4.5,1.2). All connections close.

Compute lengths by sqrt(dx^2+dy^2). Conservative estimate: longest diagonal (node_4-node_3 and node_3-node_5) might take ~7-8kN; at area 0.782, max stress ~9-10kN/0.782 ≈ 13, so well below 30. Mass: sum all (length * area). Estimate: all lengths <6.2, total mass <22. No member takes too much load with current geometry. Stress check: member_7 (node_3-node_2, anticipated highest tension) uses area 1.759 so max stress under 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "New design forms a dense network of triangles for force distribution.
