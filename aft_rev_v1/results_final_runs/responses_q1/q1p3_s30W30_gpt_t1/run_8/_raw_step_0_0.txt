Objective: design a closed, triangulated truss connecting all nodes, distributing a -10 kN force at node_3, while keeping maximum stress within ±30 and total mass below 30 units, using standard discrete section areas.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given just three nodes almost collinear at (0,0), (2,0), (6,0). Node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 with the load (-10, -45°). For optimality with so few nodes, must add a fourth node to allow triangulation and keep the design closed, to ensure force is distributed efficiently.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 acts diagonally downward left, so force must be efficiently split to the left and right supports. With only the three nodes, any triangle degenerates as nodes are almost collinear. Introducing a node above the base (say above node_3) allows an optimal triangular load path, transferring reaction forces at supports and placing node_3 at the triangle\'s tip. Forces in a basic triangle—two tie rods from node_3 to supports and a top chord—will be minimized and well distributed. Failure modes: high compression in top chord/beam, high tension in diagonals.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation needed: node_4 above or behind node_3, close to the median, so that truss members are not too long (mass penalty), and all nodes are within a closed triangular loop. Rational placement: node_4 at (2,1.5) above node_3 yields sensible geometry for symmetric force split. Use basic truss area, minimize unnecessary member length.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Use classic \'king post\' triangle: base node_1–node_2, node_3 with load sits at (2,0), node_4 at (2,1.5). Members: (1) node_1→node_2 (bottom chord), (2) node_1→node_4, (3) node_2→node_4 (top chords), (4) node_3→node_1, (5) node_3→node_2, (6) node_3→node_4 (vertical tie). This gives full closure, all nodes connected; load path is efficient: load at node_3 splits between node_1, node_2, balanced by top chord.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All loads in kN, lengths in m, areas in area_dict units. Forces in each member via method of joints—approximate by statics since truss is small. Members can take +30 (tension) and -30 (compression). Mass = Σ(length × area). Minimize mass, choose smallest possible area not violating stress limit. Calculate length of each member, resolve load using geometry. Anticipate critical members: node_3→node_4 (vertical tie, tension), node_1→node_4 and node_2→node_4 (compression), node_3→node_1 and node_3→node_2 (tension). Bottom chord is less loaded, may use smallest area.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Geometry: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (2,1.5).

Assume the vertical member (node_3–node_4) carries majority of vertical load: its axial force ≈ -10kN/sin(45°)≈-14.1kN. Choose area so stress ≈14.1/area≤30 ⇒ area≥0.47; pick area_id=\'2\' (0.782). For diagonals (~2.5m): force splits evenly; each ≈10kN/2=5kN, area=5/30~0.17, pick area_id=\'1\'(0.195). Node_3–node_1 (2m) and node_3–node_2 (4m) are lightly loaded, area_id=\'1\'. Bottom chord (node_1-node_2, 6m) has mainly compression or tension; area_id=\'0\' (smallest, for redundancy). Total mass: 6×1 + 2.5×0.195×2 + 2×0.195 + 4×0.195 + 1.5×0.782 = 6 + 0.975 + 0.39 + 0.78 + 1.173 = 9.32 <30.
