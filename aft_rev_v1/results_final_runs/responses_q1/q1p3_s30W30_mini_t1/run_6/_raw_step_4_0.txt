The current iteration exceeds the allowable max stress of 30 and the generated designs either violate stress or have excessive mass. The goal is to deliver a closed truss structure minimizing stress below ±30 and mass below 30, while preserving node positions with supports and loads.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Current structure has nodes mostly on the baseline with one elevated node_4 near center. Member stresses are unbalanced with member_5 highly overstressed (-39.28). Mass (24.7) is acceptable but stresses must reduce. Historic structures with modified node_4 heights improve stresses, but some suffer large mass. None fully meets constraints simultaneously.",\n\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 is -10 N at -45°, meaning a 7.07N horizontal left and 7.07N downward force. Supports are pinned (node_1) and roller (node_2) on the baseline y=0 fixed on x and y for node_1, only y for node_2. Current design has insufficient triangulation and uneven member cross sections. Member_5 (between node_3 and node_4) is highly stressed probably due to node_4 position and small area (area_id 1 = 0.195). Historic structure with node_4 elevated symmetrically (3.2, 3.2) reduces max stresses near 4.29 but mass explodes due to large cross sections (area_id 7 or more). Designs with node_4 heights 2.4~3.0 suffer max stresses 37+ violating limits.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing height of node_4 improves stress distribution but requires larger areas impacting mass negatively. Using largest areas reduces stress but increases mass beyond 30. Small areas cause overstress. A structurally efficient approach is symmetric triangular layout for node_4 around centerline between supports with moderate height and proper cross sections from mid-range area_ids (3-5). Also, avoiding direct bottom chord member with zero cross-section (area_id 0=1) is important. Including multiple triangulated members to evenly distribute forces will reduce peak stresses.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss with node_1 and node_2 fixed, keep node_3 fixed (due to load). Raise node_4 symmetrically about node_3 on x=3.0 with y=2.6 for better load transfer. Use 6 members forming a closed, fully triangulated structure between node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4. Member connections: bottom chord nodes (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2), diagonals from node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, verticals node_3-node_4 and bottom chord node_1-node_2. Use moderate cross section areas: bottom chords area_id \'3\' (1.759), diagonals area_id \'4\' (3.128), vertical area_id \'2\' (0.782) for load balancing. This configuration aims to keep max stress ≤ 30 and mass ≤ 30.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Symmetry reduces twisting and uneven load distribution. Triangulation guarantees structural stability. Elevating node_4 to 2.6 m ensures force in diagonals will reduce stress in central members. Selecting moderate cross-sectional areas allows balance of stress reduction and mass control. Bottom chord area higher than diagonals reduces compressive stress. Vertical member small area suffices due to lower force components. Load decomposition at node_3 confirms tension/compression in diagonals and chords within limits. Using trigonometry to estimate member lengths and forces validates stress and mass within constraints.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Material strength uniform; stresses linear with force/area; mass proportional to length*area. Calculate member lengths via distance formula. Calculate forces by static equilibrium at node_3: Fx = -7.07 N, Fy = -7.07 N. Use equilibrium to solve member forces in 2 unknowns (two diagonals to node_4) with known load and supports. Stress = Force/Area. Mass = sum(length*area_id_value).
