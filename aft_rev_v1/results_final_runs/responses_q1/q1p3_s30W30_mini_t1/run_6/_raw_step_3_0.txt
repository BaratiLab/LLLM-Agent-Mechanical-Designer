Total mass 22.7353 is within limit. Objective is to generate closed 2D truss with max stress ±30 and total mass ≤30, optimizing load transfer from node_3 load to supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller).",\n\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Loads: single load -10N at node_3 downward-left (45°). Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller at base. Nodes: three collinear base nodes and one elevated node_4. Existing members form a tetrahedron-type with areas causing overstress on member_2. History shows structures either too heavy or overstressed. ",\n\n  "analysis": "The load at node_3 is eccentric between supports node_1 and node_2. Currently, high tensile stress (-44.72) in member_2 (node_1-node_3) indicates load transfer imbalance. Members connecting elevated node_4 help reduce stress but insufficient or inefficient cross-sections lead to excess stress. Structures in history show that larger cross sections reduce stress but cause excessive mass. The constraints require a balanced triangulated design minimizing long, slender tensile members. ",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "The previous attempts all have elevated node_4 close to 3.0 height and base nodes spanning 6.0 meters. Member areas are not optimized well. The key is to create a symmetric, triangulated truss to evenly distribute forces. Adding a node at a more central elevated position and using optimized cross sections for base and vertical members can reduce max stress. Vertical load path from node_3 load down to supports must be shorter and stronger. ",\n\n  "proposal": "Redesign structure with nodes: node_1 (0,0 pinned), node_2 (6,0 roller), node_3 (2,0 load applied), and reposition node_4 to approximately (3.0,2.4) for better triangulation. Connect members to form closed triangulated quadrilateral. Assign cross section areas strategically to keep max stress ≤30 and total mass ≤30. Avoid any long member with small area causing high stress.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Use symmetric triangular bracing around load node to reduce moments across members. Node_4 elevated closer towards midpoint between node_3 and node_2 reduces member length and stress on those members. Utilize cross section id \'3\' (area=1.759) for longer base members and \'2\' (0.782) for diagonals to balance strength and mass. Pin and roller constraints provide static determinacy ensuring load transfers effectively. ",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths via distance formula. Force equilibrium: vertical sum must balance -10N at node_3; horizontal forces balanced by cross bracing. Use σ = F/A where F is axial force from analysis. Estimate forces by considering triangulation: main load carried by direct diagonal members to supports, reducing force magnitude per member. Mass = Σ(length × area). Choose area_id from given options to keep mass ≤30. ",\n\n  "calculation": "Nodes positions: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (3.0,2.4). Distances: node_1-node_3: 2m, node_3-node_2: 4m, node_1-node_4: ~3.0m, node_2-node_4: ~2.6m, node_3-node_4: ~2.4m, node_1-node_2: 6m. Assign areas: member_1 (node_1-node_3): area_id \'2\'(0.782), member_2 (node_3-node_2): \'2\'(0.782), member_3 (node_1-node_4): \'3\'(1.759), member_4 (node_4-node_2): \'3\'(1.759), member_5 (node_3-node_4): \'1\'(0.195), member_6 (node_1-node_2): \'0\'(1) to form closed loop.
