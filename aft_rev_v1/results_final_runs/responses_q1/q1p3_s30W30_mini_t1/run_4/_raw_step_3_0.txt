Objective is to produce a closed, stable, statically determinate truss with all nodes connected, satisfying max stress ±30 and total mass ≤ 30 while minimizing stresses through geometry and area selection.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Initial structure is a basic triangular framework with a high node_4 and horizontal base nodes. Load on node_3 causes high compressive stress in member_3 (node_3-node_1). The history shows attempts to reduce max stress by changing node_4 position and areas but stresses remain near or above limit. All members are single-span chords and diagonals, areas mostly small. Structural inefficiency seen in member_3 carrying excessive force due to load location and geometry.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-10N at -45°) induces compression in node_3 to node_1 member and tension in node_2 to node_3. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) fix structure horizontally and vertically. The triangular shape with node_4 high above is insufficient to redistribute forces without overstressing chord members. History shows stress concentrated in single members with small cross-section, creating large stress. Total mass is low but this trades off with strength. Adding triangulation and repositioning node_4 can better distribute load and reduce peak stresses. Current area assignments are small; larger cross sections on critical members will reduce stress. The structure must remain closed and stable.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Pattern in history: placing node_4 closer to base reduces max stress but less than needed. Large vertical height increases diagonal lengths and mass. Small areas on high-stress members cause limit exceedance. A more symmetric design with node_4 over center of base and improved triangulation should be better. Member areas must be chosen from given discrete values. Members connected to loaded node and supports require larger areas. Node positions must not move supports or load nodes. Introducing midpoint nodes or reassigning members for better force flow may help.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Redesign structure with same support and load nodes (node_1, node_2 fixed; node_3 load) but reposition node_4 near midpoint of node_1 and node_2 horizontally and elevated moderately to create equilateral-like triangulation. Connect nodes to form closed quadrilateral with cross diagonals to create full triangulation. Use larger area sections on members connected to node_3 and supports. Triangulation provides load path redundancy reducing peak stress. This approach is inspired by successful truss topologies and balances load distribution, mass and stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Principles: Use triangulation for structural stability – nodes 1, 2, 3 on base line, node 4 above midpoint creates two symmetrical triangles. Members: base chords, vertical/horizontal diagonals inside trapezoid shape distribute forces so no member overloaded. Larger areas on members transmitting major forces reduce stresses. Node_3 carries load; must have robust connections to supports and node_4. Area selection prioritizes categories 3 to 6 for critical members for strength-mass balance. Members between nodes 1-3, 2-3, and 3-4 require higher area. Symmetry and triangulation minimize bending and improve load path efficiency.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic material, uniform cross-section, static equilibrium. Calculations: Member length from node distances; mass = sum(length * area); stress = axial force/cross-sectional area. Axial force from equilibrium of forces at joints considering directions.

Node_4 positioned at x=(node_1_x+node_2_x)/2=3.0, y = about 4.2 to moderate height and reduce member length. Avoid moving load/support nodes.
