    "preamble": "Current truss is a 4-node, 6-member closed structure under a single downward-left load at node_3 with pinned and roller supports at node_1 and node_2. Objective is to minimize max stress while keeping all constraints met.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Initial status shows max member stress at 29.71 (member_4) close to +30 limit and total mass 21.33 well under max 30. Members 2,3,6 have larger cross sections (area 3), members 1,4,5 smaller (area 1). Load at node_3 induces tension/compression in legs. The structure is already stable and connected.",

    "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-10 N at -45°) introduces tension on members 2 and 6, compression on member_4 (which exhibits max tensile stress 29.71). Supports at nodes 1 and 2 provide boundary conditions with pinned and roller supports preventing rigid body motion. Triangular members around node_4 stabilize the uplift forces from the diagonal load. Current structure uses non-uniform cross sections to manage stress: members closer to load have larger areas (3), others smaller (1). History shows attempts to reposition node_4 or area selections were less optimal or violated constraints. The current condition has member_4 at stress limit, which suggests local stress concentration at the member connecting node_1 and node_4 with area 1 may be undersized.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "The pattern shows larger cross section needed in members subjected to peak tension/compression, especially member_4. Node positions for supports and loaded node are fixed, but node_4 placement may fine tune force distribution. Slight lowering node_4 can reduce vertical load component demand on member_4. Increasing member_4 cross section slightly could directly reduce stress below limit. Other members can be reduced for mass saving if their stresses are low, e.g. member_3 (stress -0.696) seems oversized. Focus on rebalancing areas rather than node repositioning due to supports/load constraints fixed.",

    "proposal": "Keep node locations of supports and loaded node fixed. Slightly lower node_4 vertical coordinate from 4.20 to around 3.85 to reduce lever arm and vertical force demand on member_4. Increase member_4 cross section from area '1' (1.0) to area '2' (0.782) or '3' (1.759) to lower max stress. Reduce member_3 area from '3' (1.759) to '1' (0.195) to save mass since its max stress is very low. Slightly reduce member_6 area from '3' (1.759) to '2' (0.782) to decrease mass while keeping stress acceptable. Keep members 2 and 5 at area '3' and '1' respectively for balance. This will retain equilibrium and satisfy constraints while lowering mass and max stress.",

    "reasoning": "Node_4 lowering reduces moment arm of load-induced vertical force on member_4, reducing its tensile stress. Increasing member_4 area proportionally reduces stress magnitude inversely. Reducing member_3 and member_6 areas saves mass but must keep stress within bounds. Triangulation remains solid. Members 1 and 5 remain smaller to keep overall mass low. The trade-off between stress and mass is balanced via discrete cross sections, respecting given area_id values.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate new lengths for members connecting node_4 with others given new y=3.85. Compute forces via statics: use load vector decomposition at node_3 and equilibrium at nodes. Use σ = F / A to check stress, with A from area_id mapping. Mass approximated by sum(length * area). Iterate area selection to keep max |σ| ≤ 30, mass ≤ 30. Check old stresses: member_4=29.71 with A=1 → increasing to A=1.759 reduces stress to ~17. This gives room to reduce member_6 area from 1.759 to 0.782 while keeping stress under 30. Reduce member_3 area to 0.195 also acceptable as stress was low (~0.7). Other members stay same or slight adjustments.",

    "calculation": "Node_4 moved from (3.00,4.20) to (3.00,3.85). Member lengths: member_4 (node_1-node_4): ~4.01m; member_6 (node_3-node_4): ~3.25m; member_3 (node_2-node_3): unchanged 4.00m. Member_4 force reduced due to lower moment arm. Max stress recalculated at member_4 with area 3: ~29.71 * (1/1.759) ≈ 16.9 < 30. Member_6 stress scaled similarly: original -4.13 with area 3 reduced to area 2 (~0.782/1.759=0.445 factor cross section) stress approx -4.13/0.445= -9.28 below 30 limit. Member_3 stress original -0.696 with area 3 to 1 (0.195/1.759=0.111) new stress ~ -0.696/0.111 ≈ -6.27 < 30 limit. Total mass recalculated as sum(lengths*areas): member_1: 6m*1=6; member_2:4m*1.759=7.04; member_3:4m*0.195=0.78; member_4:4.01*1.759=7.05; member_5: same 4.47*1=4.47 prev was 1.0065, but member_5 was length between node_2 and node_4, 6.0-3.0=3m horizontal, vertical diff 0-3.85=3.85, length ~4.83m; mass=4.83*1=4.83; member_6=3.25*0.782=2.54. Sum approx mass=6+7.04+0.78+7.05+4.83+2.54=28.24 < 30. Max stress under 30, mass under 30, constraints met.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "Design meets constraints with max stress ≈17 (member_4) and total mass ~28.24. Load path improved by node_4 lowering and cross sections rationalized. No nodes repositioned except node_4, allowed as it has no load/support. Structure maintains closed form with 6 members connecting all nodes. Stop condition not met yet; further marginal improvements possible but unlikely significant without redesign. Current structure is optimal within given constraints and cross section choices.",

    "stop": "True # The design satisfies all constraints with comfortable margins and minimal mass increase. Further improvements limited by discrete area selections and fixed support/load nodes.",
