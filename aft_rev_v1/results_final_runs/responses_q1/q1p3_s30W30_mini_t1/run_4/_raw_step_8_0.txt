Objective is to generate a fully connected closed truss minimizing stress below ±30 and keeping mass ≤30, respecting given loads and supports.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Input includes 4 nodes (2 fixed supports, 1 loaded), 6 members forming a triangular prism-like closed shape, using various cross sections. Constraints require max stress ≤ ±30 and mass ≤30.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure has high stress primarily in member_6 (node_3-node_4). Load at node_3 (-10N, -45°) creates tension/compression in members near node_3 and node_4. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) provide appropriate boundary conditions. Structure generation history shows lower max stress with node_4 lowered to ~3.85 and increasing area in some members reduces stresses but increases mass. The current high stress likely results from insufficient triangulation stiffness and inappropriate member sizing near node_4. Member_6 consistently experiences high stress, indicating a weak diagonal brace.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Decreasing node_4 height from 4.05 to ~3.85 improved max stress. Increasing cross section area on diagonals reduces stress but increases mass. Historic best structure has node_4 at (3.00, 3.85) with adjusted member areas reducing max stress to 9.34 but mass ~21, which is within mass constraint but a bit high. Stress constraint is met. Structural symmetry and triangulation are key. Current direct triangle between nodes 1, 2 and 3 does not effectively transfer loads to the supports to limit stress in diagonals.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Reuse the historic top-ranked design with node_4 at (3.00, 3.85), 6 members forming a closed truss with triangulations, adjusting cross sections to area_id \'1\' (0.195) or \'2\' (0.782) for less stressed members and \'3\' (1.759) for main members as in historic best structure. This satisfies max stress ≤30 and mass ≤30 while maintaining the closed truss and fixed loads/supports.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "The history shows best performance with node_4 lowered to 3.85, improving geometry for load transfer. Cross sections chosen as per rank_1 with \'member_5\' and \'member_6\' having area_id \'2\', providing sufficient strength with manageable mass. Triangulated geometry ensures no buckling-prone long compression members and distributes load efficiently. Symmetry about midpoint between node_1 and node_2 helps transfer loads evenly.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: small deformation linear behavior, load at node_3 at -10N at 45° angle. Take member lengths from node coords (Euclidean distance), member mass as length × area_id (mapped to density constant).
