Objective: generate a closed 2D truss structure that meets max stress ±30 and mass ≤30 constraints, minimizing stress and maintaining structural connectivity and boundary conditions.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given load at node_3 is (-10, -45°) implying downward-left force. Supports are pinned at node_1 (0,0) and roller at node_2 (6,0). Current nodes are mostly colinear along x-axis except node_4 at (2,3). Members form a triangle base (1-2-3) with a top node_4 connected to base nodes. Max compressive stress is on member_3 (node_3-node_1) at -38.28 exceeding -30 limit. Total mass is moderate (22.75) but stresses require reduction. Areas used vary, but some members are under high stress indicating possible cross-section or geometry refinement needed. No closed polygon at base, triangle node_1-2-3 is closed but member_3 stress is too high.",\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 acts roughly downward-left causing compression in member_3 (node_3-node_1) and tension in others. Node_3 is on x-axis interior between nodes 1 and 2, so load path induces high stress on member_3 due to direct force transfer to support at node_1. Members connecting node_4 add triangulation but high areas (3) induce higher mass. Current geometry has node_3 on base line, causing long members under heavy compression. Closed structure with 4 nodes but no symmetry about load. History shows no better design. To reduce stress, reposition node_3 and node_4 to better triangulate and distribute loads with shorter compression members, and assign areas strategically from area_id to balance strength and weight. Supports fixed, load node fixed. Load at node_3 fixed at (2,0) is problematic; reposition node_3 within constraint?",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Node_3 position fixed due to load and no instruction to move it. Therefore, only node_4 can move. Need to move node_4 to improve triangulation and reduce compression on member_3. Also optimize member areas, increasing cross-section of key compression members to lower stress but keep total mass ≤30. Restore symmetry about vertical axis from node_1 to node_2 to balance load paths. Add diagonal members from node_4 to base nodes to close truss. Consider raising node_4 above current height to increase triangle height, shortening base compression members. Maybe adjust member assignments to area_id 2 or 3 selectively.",\n    "proposal": "Retain nodes 1, 2, and 3 positions due to supports and load conditions. Reposition node_4 upwards and slightly centered to form a taller, more symmetric triangle with base nodes (1, 2) to improve force distribution. Use at least four members forming two triangles: base triangle (1-2-3) and upper triangles (4-1, 4-2, 4-3) to fully triangulate and close structure. Increase cross-section area for members under higher compressive stress (like member_3) from 1 to 3 or 4. Use smaller areas for less stressed members to reduce mass. This closed 4-node truss should satisfy max stress ±30 and mass ≤30.",\n    "reasoning": "Symmetric trusses with proper triangulation improve stability and load transfer. Raising node_4 increases vertical height, reducing force in base chord (which is in compression) by increasing angle and reducing length of compression members. Using larger area for highly compressed members lowers stress by increasing capacity. Members with tension or low stress can have smaller area to reduce mass. The closed shape avoids unbraced members and distributes loads efficiently to supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Load at node_3 is between supports requiring robust triangulation around it.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic behavior, member axial forces dominate, stress = force/area. Member length calculated by node distance. Mass = sum(length x area_density). Area_density corresponds to area_ids given; pick area_ids matching cross-section requirement and mass budget. Calculate member forces by vertical/horizontal equilibrium at nodes with known support conditions and applied load. Iteratively adjust member areas to not exceed ±30 stress while keeping mass under 30. Node_3 fixed. Node_4 set at about (3.0, 5.0) to raise height and symmetrize. Use triangulation: members (1-3), (2-3), (1-2), (1-4), (2-4), (3-4). Areas mostly 3 (1.759) for compression, 1 (1.0) for others.",\n    "calculation": "Distances (meters): L_1-2=6.0, L_1-3=2.0, L_2-3=4.0, L_1-4=sqrt((3-0)^2+(5-0)^2)=5.83, L_2-4=sqrt((6-3)^2+(0-5)^2)=5.83, L_3-4=sqrt((3-2)^2+(5-0)^2)=5.10.

Too high total mass (60+). Reduce some cross-sections: member_4,5 drop to 2(0.782), member_6 to 1. Final mass approx: 6+3.13+6.256+(5.83*0.782*2)+(5.10*1.0)=6+3.13+6.256+9.12+5.10=29.6<=30.
