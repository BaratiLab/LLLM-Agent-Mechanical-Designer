Objective is to minimize max stress and total mass within constraints.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress is 15.41 < 30 and total mass 28.29 < 30 satisfying constraints. History shows that more symmetric, slightly repositioned node_4 at (4.0, 3.0) and adjusted areas lowered max stress and mass. Current node_4 at (4.1, 3.2) led to slight increase in max stress and mass. Improvement possible by adopting the best historic geometry and fine-tuning member areas.",\n\n    "analysis": "Load acts on node_3 down-left (magnitude 10N at -45°). Nodes 1 and 2 provide boundary conditions limiting movement. Current design has members forming triangles for stiffness. Member 1 (node_1-node_3) is max stressed in compression (-15.41). Historic best design uses stronger areas for top members and reduces stress. Additionally, members 4 and 5 (top triangle members) could have reduced areas while maintaining load paths. Current mass is near limit but can be lowered slightly by adjusting node_4 to (4.00,3.00) for better triangulation and area selections realistic with available discrete sizes.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Best historic structure (rank_1) shows node_4 at (4.0,3.0), with members 1 and 2 using area_id \'3\' (1.759), member_4 and 5 at \'2\' (0.782), and chord member_6 as \'1\' (0.195) achieves max stress 10.87 and mass 26.16 < current design\'s 28.29 mass and 15.41 max stress. This indicates a design direction using slight repositioning and area adjustment can improve performance. Reducing node_4 height slightly from 3.2 to 3.0 enhances triangulation and member force distribution.",\n\n    "proposal": "Adopt the best historic node positioning and member areas from rank_1 structure, with nodes fixed for supports and load unchanged. Node_4 moved to (4.00, 3.00) for improved triangulation. Assign member areas: members 1 and 2 area_id \'3\' (1.759), members 4 and 5 area_id \'2\' (0.782), member 3 area_id \'3\' (1.759), member 6 area_id \'1\' (0.195). This balances mass and stress minimizing max stress to ~10.87 and mass ~26.16, satisfying constraints.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Symmetry w.r.t. horizontal base line helps balanced load transfer. Triangular bracing reduces bending and high stress concentrations. Smaller cross sections on less stressed members reduce mass without exceeding stress limits. Repositioning node_4 improves load path geometry minimizing peak stress. Using discrete area sizes from allowed sets ensures manufacturability and feasibility.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths from precise node coords: node_1:(0.0,0.0), node_2:(6.0,0.0), node_3:(2.0,0.0), node_4:(4.0,3.0). Calculate member mass = length * area_id value. Estimate max member stress applying load and supports considering member stiffness proportional to area. Check max abs stress ≤30 and total mass ≤30. Force balance and triangulation ensure loads transfer efficiently from node_3 to supports.",\n\n    "calculation": "Member lengths: m1(node_1-node_3) = 2.0m, m2(node_3-node_2) = 4.0m, m3(node_1-node_4) = 5.0m, m4(node_4-node_2) = 3.61m, m5(node_3-node_4) = 3.6m, m6(node_1-node_2) = 6.0m.

Mass approx = sum(length * area) = (2*1.759)+(4*1.759)+(5*1.759)+(3.61*0.782)+(3.6*0.782)+(6*0.195) = 3.518 + 7.036 + 8.795 + 2.82 + 2.816 + 1.17 = 26.16 < 30.
