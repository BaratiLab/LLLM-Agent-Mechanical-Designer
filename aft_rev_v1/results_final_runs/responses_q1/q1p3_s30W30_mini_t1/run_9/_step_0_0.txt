    "preamble": "Design a closed 2D truss using three given nodes with a downward-left load at node_3, pinned and roller supports at node_1 and node_2, respectively. Objective is to minimize stress and total mass while satisfying max stress ±30 and mass ≤30 constraints. Closed triangulated design necessary for stability and load transfer.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Input nodes: node_1(0.0,0.0) pinned support, node_2(6.0,0.0) roller support, node_3(2.0,0.0) loaded (-10N, 45° down-left). Constraints include max stress ±30 and total mass ≤ 30. Initial 3-node linear form is unstable and not closed. Need to add node(s) for triangulation.",
    
    "analysis": "Given three colinear nodes, structure is unstable for vertical loads and not closed. Load at node_3 points diagonally; support reactions alone won't stabilize structure if colinear. Lack of triangulation leads to zero stiffness in vertical direction and no load path. Additional node(s) off baseline needed to form triangle(s). Candidate: Add node_4 above baseline near node_3 for triangulation. Members must form a closed loop to distribute load and minimize stress efficiently. Member forces must be checked for tension/compression within limits. Mass depends on lengths & chosen cross sections.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding node_4 at approximately (2.8, 3.5) creates two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_3, node_4, node_2), closing the loop. Triangulation stiffens structure and transfers load efficiently. Members: [node_1-node_3], [node_3-node_2], [node_1-node_4], [node_4-node_3], [node_4-node_2]. Cross sections chosen preferentially smaller for shorter members, larger for longer or critical load paths, balancing mass and stress distribution.",
    
    "reasoning": "To resist load at node_3, triangulate adding node_4 above baseline to form stable triangles. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) provide lateral support and vertical reactions. Use higher area (like area_id '4' = 3.128 or '3' =1.759) on main load-carrying members ([node_3 - node_4], [node_4 - node_1]) and smaller areas on bracing members ([node_1-node_3]), maintaining mass < 30. Stress limit ±30 will be satisfied by limiting member forces with proper geometry and cross-sectional areas.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear static analysis, members carry axial force only. Compute member lengths by Euclidean distance. Area masses scale linearly with length×area value. Forces balanced by equilibrium: sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, moment equilibrium about supports. Calculate member forces using method of joints. Estimate axial stress = force / area. Use given discrete areas to select closest fit ensuring stress ≤30. Check sum mass = Σ(length × area) ≤ 30.",
