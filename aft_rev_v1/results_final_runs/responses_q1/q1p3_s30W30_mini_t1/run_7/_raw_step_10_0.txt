Max stress is 17.12, below limit, but mass is 25.42 close to limit. Load applied at node_3 causes high compressive stress in member_1. Area sizes for members are moderate to large (area_id 2 and 3), so some oversized members increase mass. Nodes with supports (node_1, node_2) are fixed; node_3 loaded; node_4 is free for minor repositioning. Triangulation is present.",\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-10N, -45°) induces compression in member_1 and tension/shear in others. Member_1 is highly stressed (-17.12). Members 4-6 have moderate low stress. Member_3 (base) provides horizontal stability. Current structure is statically determinate and stable. History shows attempts to shift node_4 position increase mass or violate constraints. Lower area_id values for highly stressed members could reduce mass but risk higher stress. The most efficient structure should have slightly optimized node_4 position to balance vertical load transfer and minimize member lengths and areas. The load path is mostly from node_3 diagonally to node_1 and node_4, and then distributed to node_2 and ground.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Current transparent clear load path with member_1 critical. Members 4-6 area_id=3 is adequate. Node_4 repositioning in history mostly leads to constraint violation or mass increase. Slight repositioning or lowering area_id in low-stressed members might save mass. Member areas are discretized; tradeoffs between smaller areas and stress capacity needed. No floating nodes or disconnected members. Minimal mass can be reached by reducing member_2 and member_6 areas where stress is very low (-0.85 and -5.15 respectively).",\n    "proposal": "Optimize current structure by fine-tuning node_4 position (slight upward shift to improve force direction) and adjust member areas: reduce area_id for low stress members (member_2, member_5, member_6) while keeping member_1 area large enough to maintain stress under limits. Keep 6 members and 4 nodes to maintain closed triangulation and ensure structural stability and minimal mass.",\n    "reasoning": "By moving node_4 slightly up and right, better load distribution through members 4, 5, and 6 may reduce stresses on member_1 allowing a slight reduction in area. Reducing area_id for less stressed members decreases total mass. Triangulation ensures no instability. Position change limited since node_4 is free to move within constraints and nodes 1, 2 fixed per support & loads rules.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members carry axial loads only. Stress = Force / (Area × Cross-sectional area). Areas based on discrete ids given. Member length is Euclidean distance between nodes. Total mass ~ ∑ length × area_id. Use area_id from {0:1,1:0.195,2:0.782,3:1.759} to minimize mass. Small node_4 position shift constrained by load path integrity.

Estimated max stress ~16.7 (improved), total mass ~26.85 slightly higher than previously but with reduced max stress margin.
