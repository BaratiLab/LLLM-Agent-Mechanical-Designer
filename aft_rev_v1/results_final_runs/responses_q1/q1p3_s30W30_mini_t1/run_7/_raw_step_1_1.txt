Objective is to generate a closed, feasible truss structure minimizing stress and total mass <= 30 with max stress <= ±30.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max stress ±30, mass ≤30. Current design: 4 nodes, loaded at node_3 (-10N at -45°), supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current mass too high due to thick members near load and large cross sections. Current structure forms non-ideal load paths causing high stress in member_5 (-28.77). Need better triangulation and more efficient load transfer.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 imposes inclined force; supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) on horizontal base. Current member layout includes base members and vertical diagonal members but introduces low-efficiency direct member (\'member_1\' node_1-node_2 with largest cross section 1.0) contributing to heavy mass. High stress magnitude in member_5 suggests overloading due to direct horizontal members near load node_3 and insufficient load distribution. The triangle formed by nodes 1,2,4 is large but overbuilt. Nodes 3 and 4 close to base with vertical separation only 3m. No intermediate nodes to distribute load. Structure is not sufficiently triangulated around node_3, causing high stress. Historic structure did not meet constraints.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce mass and stress, introduce an additional node to reduce member length near load, improve triangulation around node_3 and load transfer, and replace oversized areas with smaller sections where possible. Using smaller cross-sectional areas for base members and better force path can reduce mass. Keep pinned and roller supports fixed at same points. Node_3 fixed due to load constraint. Adding node at intermediate location vertically and horizontally near node_3 can better distribute load. Structure must be fully connected (closed). Symmetry is not necessary due to load location, but good triangulation is essential.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a fifth node between node_2 and node_3 higher along vertical axis to create effective triangulation near the load. Remove direct horizontal member between node_1 and node_2 to reduce mass and replace with diagonal members. Use minimal cross sections for longer base members and allocate larger cross sections only on members near load bearing. Keep supports and load nodes fixed. Create closed triangulated shape connecting nodes 1,2,3,4,5 with proper diagonals forming multiple triangles and improving load transfer.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "A 5-node structure with good triangulation effectively distributes forces and reduces maximum stress. Positioning node_5 near the load but elevated improves load path to supports via shorter members. Remove large base member from node_1 to node_2 replaced by shorter diagonals with smaller cross-section reduces mass. Using 3.128 and 1.759 as cross sections in critical members balances stress capacity and weight. Node_3 position kept fixed (2.0, 0.0). Node_1 at origin (0,0) pinned, node_2 at (6,0) roller. Place node_4 above node_3 at ~ (2.0,2.5). Place node_5 near node_2, higher than node_3 at (4.0,1.5). Connect members to form triangles: (1-4), (4-3), (3-5), (5-2), (4-5), (1-3), (2-3). This forms multiple triangles and good load transfer. Choose smaller area for longer members (node_1-node_4, node_5-node_2) and larger areas near nodes with load and support reaction forces.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: material density uniform, stress proportional to force/area, member force from static equilibrium, loads vertical and horizontal components decomposed from load vector. Calculate member lengths using distance formula sqrt((x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2), calculate mass member length * area_id value. Check sum mass ≤30. Approximate member forces using joints equilibrium equations (sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0). Assign area to keep stress ≤30 MPa max. Calculate stress = Force / (Area * Area_factor), assuming unit modulus, stress ~ force/area. Adjust areas or reposition node_5 to minimize force and thus stress. Nodes loaded and supported fixed.
