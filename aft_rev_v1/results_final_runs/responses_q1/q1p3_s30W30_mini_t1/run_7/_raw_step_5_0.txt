Objective is a closed truss that keeps nodes and supports fixed where loads/supports are applied, minimizing max stress under ±30 and total mass ≤30.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given load: 10 kN at node_3 directed -45°. Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller along x-axis. Existing nodes clustered at base (y=0) and one at y=3. History shows stress overloads mainly at member_3 connecting node_1 to node_3 and general high mass in members of large cross-sectional areas. Areas range from 0.195 to 4.887 in history. All designs fail constraints by exceeding stress or mass.",\n  "analysis": "Current structure has members between lower nodes and single apex node (node_4 at y=3). Load applied at node_3 between node_1 and node_2 causes high compressive stress in member_3 due to diagonal load component. History suggests compression failures in these members and excess mass. The supports at nodes 1 and 2 fix vertical and horizontal reactions but do not reduce load paths efficiently, leading to overstressed diagonals. Adding an additional node at an intermediate height and employing additional triangulation should distribute stresses better, reduce member length and mass. Closed structures benefit from triangulated forms to achieve stability and reduce high member forces. Avoid large cross sections on long members to save mass. Symmetry about the mid-span between node_1 and node_2 avoids eccentric loading.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Insight: Stress concentrations appear on direct diagonal members connecting node_3 loaded node to base nodes, implying inefficient load transfer. Introducing a new mid-height node between node_3 and apex node_4 can split members, shorten member length, reduce stresses. Using lower cross-sectional areas for lighter members and selectively larger ones near load paths will help meet mass limit. Ensuring closed loops with triangulation between nodes will add stiffness and help transfer load through multiple paths, thus reducing stress on any single member.",\n  "proposal": "Redesign with original supports and loaded nodes fixed, add a new node between node_3 and node_4 at mid-height for clipping load path and additional triangulation. Members will be connected to form a closed triangular network between node_1, node_2, new mid node, and existing apex node_4. Select member areas to balance mass and stress, favoring lighter sections for shorter members and moderate sections for longest load path members.",\n  "reasoning": "By adding a mid-height node (node_5) at about y=1.5 between node_3 and node_4 vertically, the structure forms 2 adjacent triangles: node_1-node_5-node_4 and node_2-node_5-node_4, plus lower base triangle node_1-node_2-node_3. This reduces maximum member length, distributes vertical & horizontal components of load at node_3, reduces direct compression/tension in long diagonals. The load at node_3 is near base level; thus, the triple triangular system provides redundant load paths, reducing member forces. Use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for critical members carrying primary loads (base diagonals), and smaller area_id \'1\' (0.195) for shorter, reticulated edges to save mass. This layout keeps node_1 and node_2 fixed as supports, node_3 fixed at (2.0, 0) due to load, apex node_4 fixed at (3.0, 3.0) for stiffness and height, and node_5 at approximately (2.5, 1.5) to maximize triangulation and minimize member length.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Member mass proportional to length * area_id * constant density, with density and length unit normalization.
