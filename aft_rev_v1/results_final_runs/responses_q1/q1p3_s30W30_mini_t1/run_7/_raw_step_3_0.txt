The objective is to redesign a closed truss with given supports and load that satisfies all constraints while minimizing stress.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Current structure has max stress ~41.89 > 30 and mass ~38.4 > 30. Load on node_3 (-10 N, -45°), pinned support at node_1(0,0) and roller at node_2 (6,0). Nodes mostly aligned on x-axis with one elevated node causing stress concentration. Previous structures show stress reduction by lowering top node and adjusting members.",\n\n  "analysis": "In the existing design, node_4 at (3.5, 3.0) creates a large lever arm causing high stress, especially in member_5 connecting node_1 and node_3 (stress -41.89). The roller at node_2 allows horizontal freedom, so horizontal load components should be taken by pinned node_1 through triangulated members. The previous best design moved node_4 lower to ~2.0-3.0 height, reducing max stress to ~28.7 but increasing total mass to ~43.5 (too high). Excessive mass stems from large cross section members and long members with bigger area. A closed, triangulated truss with lower top node and redistribution of areas can ensure stress limits and mass constraints. Additional node between node_3 and node_2 may help distribute forces more effectively. The structure must remain kinematically stable with no isolated nodes.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing node_4 height and adding node_5 between node_3 and node_2 could enhance load distribution and reduce stress peaks. Using mid-range areas (~3.128 or 4.887) for main load-bearing members and smaller areas (0.782 or 0.195) for diagonal tension members can reduce mass. Keep support node_1 and node_2 fixed; load node_3 also fixed. The structure must be fully triangulated, closed and stable. Three outer nodes form base and load point, top node(s) form apex to transfer vertical load to supports.",\n\n  "proposal": "Redesign truss with 5 nodes: fixed nodes node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0) with load; add node_4 at (2.0, 2.2) as apex; add node_5 at (4.0, 1.3) between node_3 and node_2. Connect to form closed triangulated truss with members joining all nodes to distribute forces and reduce peak stresses.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Triangulation ensures stability. Placing node_4 lower (2.2 height) than before reduces bending moment in longest members. Node_5 between node_3 and node_2 splits horizontal span reducing member lengths and stress. Areas selected to balance mass and strength: larger areas on vertical and main chords, smaller on diagonals in tension/compression. Supports and load positions remain fixed by constraints.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: + Load vector decomposed into x,y components: Fx = -10*cos45° = -7.07 N, Fy = -10*sin45° = -7.07 N at node_3. + Members lengths and geometry used to estimate axial forces by static equilibrium (sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, sum moments=0) at each node. + Stress = axial force / area. + Member mass = length * area_id (area values used as proxy for cross section). + Max stress <= ±30, total mass <= 30. + Areas chosen from given area_id keys. + Nodes fixed: node_1(0,0) pinned; node_2(6,0) roller; nodes with load fixed. + Design to avoid compression failure and bending.",\n\n  "calculation": "Node coordinates chosen: node_1(0.00,0.00), node_2(6.00,0.00), node_3(2.00,0.00), node_4(2.00,2.20), node_5(4.00,1.30).
