Objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss meeting max stress ±30 and total mass ≤30, with pinned and roller supports fixed and loads unchanged.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given structure has 5 nodes mostly on a trapezoidal shape with diagonal and chord members. Load is a 10N inclined force downward-left at node_3. Supports pinned at node_1 at origin and roller at node_2 along x-axis. Current mass very large mostly due to large cross-sectional areas and member lengths. Max stress at member_6 in compression (-5.43). Goal: reduce mass drastically and keep stresses within ±30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The load applied at node_3 creates bending and shear forces in horizontal members node_1-node_2 and diagonals to node_4 and node_5. Current structure has multiple diagonals creating redundant paths but mass is too high due to large size and areas. The node_3 at ground level between pinned and roller along axis leads to high force concentration members especially member_6 (node_1-node_5) under compression. Using smaller section areas to reduce mass but must keep stress below 30. Without moving support/load nodes, shape must be reconfigured to efficiently triangulate the load path with shorter members and lower area requirements.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Current structure\'s mass ~105 far above max 30. Members with large length and area cause this. Load at node_3 middle ground line causes peak compression in corner chords. Design needs more triangular bracing with short diagonals reducing member length and transferring forces better. Reducing vertical height reduces moment arms and internal forces. Using cross sections with area ids mostly ≤3 for mass control is necessary.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Redesign to a simpler triangular/trapezoidal closed truss with 4 nodes: node_1 and node_2 fixed, node_3 fixed load, add one or two elevated nodes forming two triangles for load distribution. Use small cross section areas for all members to control mass. Keep node_3 at (2.00,0.00), node_1(0.00,0.00), node_2(6.00,0.00) fixed. Add node_4 above node_3 at about y=2.00 to reduce moment arms and distribute compression/tension effectively. Connect all nodes to form closed triangulated frame.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "The triangular truss can transfer the inclined force at node_3 into tension/compression chords efficiently. Keeping nodes 1,2,3 fixed respects support/load constraints. Addition of node_4 at midspan height forms two triangles with nodes (1,3,4) and (3,2,4) sharing node_4 on top. This reduces bending moments in base chords. Using sections with area_id=\'3\' (1.759 unit area) or below keeps mass under control while still keeping axial capacity to hold 10N force with factor of safety. Smaller height reduces member length and hence mass. Triangulation ensures closed structure with no unstable members.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All members carry axial force only. Load applied at node_3 (-10N at -45°) decomposed into Fx=-7.07N, Fy=-7.07N. Supports node_1 pinned (both x,y), node_2 roller (vertical support only). Calculate member lengths by distance formula, member mass = length*area. Max stress = axial force / sectional area ≤ 30. Axial forces estimated by static equilibrium and symmetry: Vertical force at node_3 balanced by tension in diagonals to node_4 and compression in horizontal members node_1-node_2. Using triangles, axial forces split roughly equally reducing max stress. Use smallest area_id=3 (area=1.759) or 2 (0.782) to meet mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1(0.0,0.0), node_2(6.0,0.0), node_3(2.0,0.0), node_4(3.6,2.0). Member lengths (approx): m1(1-3)=2m, m2(3-2)=4m, m3(1-4)=4.27m, m4(4-2)=2.83m, m5(3-4)=2.28m. Using simplest distribution, axial forces per member under combination of vertical and horizontal load components ~10N max. Area selection: use area 3 (1.759) or area 2 (0.782) for main members to keep mass low. Total mass=sum(l_i * a_i): ~ (2*1.759)+(4*0.782)+(4.27*0.782)+(2.83*1.759)+(2.28*0.782)=3.518+3.128+3.34+4.97+1.78=16.7 <30.
