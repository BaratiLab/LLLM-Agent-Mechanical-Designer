Load applied at node_3 (-10 at -45°), supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Members sized 1 to 3 with various cross-section areas. The structure is closed and connected.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Stress mostly concentrated on member_7 (14.53), two orders of magnitude higher than others. Members 4 and 6 carry similar loads with large cross sections, suggesting potential over-sizing and inefficiency. Member_7 is short (node_2 to node_5) with area \'1\' = 0.195, likely causing high stress. Load path transfers from node_3 diagonally up through nodes 4 and 5 to supports. Slightly shifting node_5 upward and left may reduce stresses in member_7 by increasing length and redistributing loads. Members 1 and 2 equally sized and load shared well. Triangulation present but could improve by adjusting node_5 for better load resolution.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing length of highly stressed member_7 is beneficial. Consider increasing its area moderately (e.g., area_id \'2\' = 0.782) to reduce stress while keeping mass low. Potentially reduce large areas in members 4 and 6 if stresses are low to gain mass savings. Node_5 can move left and slightly up within free space to improve angles and load paths without increasing overall height beyond 3.2 for geometric stability. Node_4 fixed to maintain current support node positions and load transfer paths.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Optimize current structure by relocating node_5 left by ~0.3m and up by ~0.1m, increasing member_7 area from \'1\' to \'2\' to reduce max stress. Reduce members 4 and 6 from area \'3\' to \'2\' to offset mass increase, maintaining stress balance. Keep other members unchanged to maintain load paths and constraints.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Load from node_3 acts diagonally down-left; member_7 carries highest tensile load with small area and short length. Increasing its length by relocating node_5 reduces stress by distributing load over longer member, while increasing area lowers stress further. Reducing members 4 and 6 areas reduces mass counteracting the increase. Triangular topology preserved for stability. Moves respect fixed load/support nodes and maintain closed geometry between nodes. Mass and stress constraints respected by balancing areas and geometry.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate new length of member_7 between node_2 (6.0,0.0) and adjusted node_5 (approx 3.7, 3.1). Length ~3.9m vs old ~3.16m. Stress inversely proportional to area and length; increasing area from 0.195 to 0.782 and length ~1.23x reduces stress ~1/(1.23*4) = ~1/5 factor approx. Mass recalculated as sum of lengths*area (using area value from area_id keys). Members 4 and 6 lengths 3.605 each; area reduced from 1.759 to 0.782 halves mass, reducing overall structure mass very close or less than current 21.9894.

Members 4 and 6 stresses expected ~3.22* (0.782/1.759) = ~1.43 and -1.61*(0.782/1.759) = ~-0.72, safely within limits. Mass recalculated: member_7 mass = 3.9*0.782 = 3.05 kg (vs 0.7 old), members 4 and 6 mass = 3.605*0.782=2.82 each, previous 6.34 each; mass saved ~7.1 - 5.64 = 1.46. Total mass estimate 21.9894 - (6.34+6.34+0.7) + (2.82+2.82+3.05) = 21.9894 - 13.38 + 8.69 = 17.3 kg, under mass constraint.
