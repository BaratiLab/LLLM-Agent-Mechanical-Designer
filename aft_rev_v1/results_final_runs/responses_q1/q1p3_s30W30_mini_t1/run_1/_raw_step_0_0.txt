Objective is to minimize stress and mass within limits by adding nodes/members and choosing cross-section areas.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given 3 nodes along x-axis and single diagonal load at node_3, need a closed truss to transmit load. The existing nodes are colinear initially, so structure is unstable without triangulation. The system requires additional nodes to form closed triangles ensuring stability and distributing stress to meet max ±30 stress and mass ≤30.",\n\n    "analysis": "Supports: node_1 pinned (both x,y fixed), node_2 roller (vertical fixed). Load: node_3 at (2,0) with magnitude 10 units at -45°. Currently, nodes colinear, no triangulation, unstable. Adding two nodes above nodes 3 and 2 to create two non-colinear triangles will provide load path. The load at node_3 will be shared by members towards top nodes. Members must be sized for stress ≤ ±30. Triangulation reduces bending moments and distributes forces efficiently, minimizing heavy cross-sections and mass. Members along longer length will have smaller cross-section to control mass.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key insight: Adding two nodes above base line at about y=3.5 will form two triangles: node_1-node_4-node_3 and node_3-node_5-node_2 with closed loop connecting nodes [1,4,3,5,2]. This arrangement is stable and forms closed shape. Using balanced areas chosen from given discrete areas can meet stress and mass constraints. Node_4 near (1,3.5), node_5 near (4,3.5) balances force flow and geometry.",\n\n    "reasoning": "To optimize, create two new nodes positioned to form stiff equilateral-ish triangles approximately 3.5 units above baseline. Connect all nodes creating closed loops. Use smaller cross-section areas on diagonal members under less force, and larger areas on members carrying high force. Lengths and forces calculated via static equilibrium (vertical/horizontal balance). Approximate load distribution with symmetry. Member selection balances stress and mass constraints. Avoid very large areas to keep mass under 30.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members carry axial forces only. Static equilibrium: ∑Fx=0, ∑Fy=0, ∑M=0. Calculate member lengths: Euclidean distance. Use load components Fx = -10*cos45= -7.07, Fy = -10*sin45= -7.07. Distribute load roughly to top nodes; members to base nodes carry reaction forces. Mass = ∑ length*area. Estimated stress = Force/Area. Calculate forces based on geometry and loadings to size area from given area_ids to keep |stress|≤30 and total mass ≤30.",\n\n    "calculation": "Nodes added: node_4=(1.5, 3.5), node_5=(4.5, 3.5). Members: (1-4), (4-3), (3-5), (5-2), (1-3), (2-3). Calculate lengths: l_1-4=3.807, l_4-3=3.807, l_3-5=3.807, l_5-2=3.807, l_1-3=2.0, l_2-3=4.0. Distribute load: approximate axial forces 15 units max on main diagonals, less on base chords (5 and 4 units). Chose areas: main diagonals area_id \'3\'(1.759), base chords area_id \'1\'(0.195). Stress = Force/Area: max stress ~15/1.759=8.53 < 30. Mass: sum(length*area_id) ~ (4*3.807*1.759)+(2*0.195*(2+4))=26.8 + 2.34=29.14 < 30.
