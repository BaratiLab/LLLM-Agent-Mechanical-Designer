Objective is to create a closed triangulated structure minimizing stress and total mass within constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes are colinear: node_1(0,0), node_3(2,0), node_2(6,0). Load at node_3 is -10N at -45°, implies downward-left force. Supports fix nodes_1 and 2 horizontally and vertically (pinned and roller). Need closed shape, but current is a line, so add node(s) above to close triangle and share load paths. Constraints: max stress ±30, mass ≤30 from discrete cross sectional areas.",\n\n    "analysis": "Colinear nodes yield a zero-area shape, no triangulation, high bending in members causing high stress. Triangulation needed via a node above line. Load applies down-left on node_3 so prefers a vertical and diagonal load path to supports. Members: node_1 to node_3, node_3 to node_2, plus added node_4 above, connected to all nodes forming two triangles. Compression and tension will distribute better, lowering stress. Mass controlled by selecting minimal sufficient areas. Failure modes include buckling in compression members and tensile yielding; ensure areas chosen balance forces with max stress ±30.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "A single node added above colinear line at x≈3, y≈3 (equilateral triangle approx) creates closed shape. Triangular topology ensures statically determinate structure with 4 nodes and 5 members, preventing mechanisms. Use moderate area sizes to keep mass under 30. Load resolved into members connected to node_4 and supports, reducing stress on node_3’s adjacent members. Members at angles distribute forces better than purely horizontal ones.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at roughly (3.0, 3.0) forming two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_3, node_2, node_4). Connect members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_2-node_4 for closed stout triangulated frame. Use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for lower force members and \'4\' (3.128) for members under main load (node_3-node_4). This balances stress and mass. Calculations approximate forces from geometry and load direction using static equilibrium and trigonometry.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members are axial, linear elastic, uniform cross sections. Forces balance at each node. Mass = Σ(member length × area_id). Stress = force/area proportional. Calculate member lengths via distance formula. Resolve node_3 load -10N@ -45° as Fx = -7.07 N, Fy = -7.07 N. Use static equilibrium equations at nodes to find member forces. Check max |stress| ≤30 with area chosen.
