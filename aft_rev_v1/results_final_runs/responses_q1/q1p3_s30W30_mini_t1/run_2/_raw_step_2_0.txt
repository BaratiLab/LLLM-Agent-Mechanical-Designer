Objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss with fixed load/support node positions, satisfying max stress ≤ ±30 and total mass ≤ 30, minimizing stress and mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given load is a 10N force at node_3 at -45°, supports are pinned at node_1(0,0) and roller at node_2(6,0). Existing node_3 at (2,0) is loaded. Current max stress 6.08 < 30 but mass 44.4 > 30 violates mass constraint. Need weight reduction while maintaining strength.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The load at node_3 generates combined shear and axial actions. Support nodes are at ends of the base line spanning 6 units. The truss uses 5 nodes with some in the upper plane at y~3. Current structure mass is high due to large areas on members 6 and 7 (area_id \'4\', 3.128) and member lengths. Stress distribution shows member_4 near limit 6.078, others well below max. History shows simpler 4-node truss had very high stress 52.38, so complexity and node count are justified. The structure is closed but member area assignments cause excessive mass. Load path assumes tension/compression in vertical and diagonal members from node_3 load to supports at node_1 and node_2. Members member_6 and member_7 are long and large area, mass heavy. Nodes 4 and 5 are critical to triangulation and load transfer. Member lengths and cross-sectional areas must be optimized.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Mass excess mainly due to large areas on long diagonal members (node_3 to node_4 and node_5). Members with smallest stresses (under 2) can use smaller cross section. Node positions at supports and loaded node fixed by constraint. Triangulation is important for load path. Minimizing member lengths with strategic node repositioning may help but loaded node fixed at (2,0). Introduce an additional node near center top to distribute load better and reduce diagonal spans. Reduce area on long members to smaller area_id while ensuring stress ≤ ±30.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Retain support nodes at (0,0) and (6,0) and loaded node at (2,0). Add a new node near center top (~3, 2.5) to improve triangulation and redistribute forces, reduce long diagonal spans. Use smaller area_ids for diagonals, increase if stress near limit. Close truss via lateral and vertical members connecting new node with existing top nodes (node_4, node_5) and loaded node (node_3). Assign area_ids cautiously to keep total mass ≤ 30.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Symmetry about mid-span not strict given load at 2 m from left support, asymmetry tolerated. Triangular elements improve stiffness and reduce bending. Avoid long slender members with large cross-section to reduce mass and stress. Cross-section areas on unloaded or lightly loaded members minimized. Use node_1 and node_2 as base nodes pinned and roller to provide boundary reaction. Node_3 remains load node (2,0). Introduce node_6 at (3.5, 2.5) to break long diagonals and distribute load. Key members: base members, diagonals, and top chords. Use cross-sectional areas from area_id in range 0.195 to 1.759 as per load demand.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic truss, axial forces only, 2D planar. Calculate member lengths via distance formula. Mass estimated as sum of (length × area) where area from area_id dict. Stress estimated as axial force/cross-sectional area. Force equilibrium at nodes used to estimate internal forces. Cross-section selection based on member force magnitude ensuring stress ≤ 30 with safety margin. Load 10N at node_3 resolved into components: Fx = 10*cos(-45°) = 7.07N, Fy = 10*sin(-45°) = -7.07N approx. Members connecting loaded node to new node and supports carry tension/compression.
