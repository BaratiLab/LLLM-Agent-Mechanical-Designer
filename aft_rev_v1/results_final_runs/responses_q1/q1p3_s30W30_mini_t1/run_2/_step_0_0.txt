    "preamble": "Design a closed 2D truss with nodes at (0,0), (6,0), and (2,0) with load at node_3, pinned and roller supports. Objective is to minimize stress (<±30), ensure closure and connectedness, and total mass ≤30 using given area sizes.",

    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes are colinear on x-axis causing structural instability for lateral load at node_3. Load (-10, -45°) applies compressive/tensile forces combined with shear. Supports at extreme ends: node_1 pinned (all DOF), node_2 roller (vertical restraint). Current arrangement is unstable and cannot resist lateral load without out-of-plane deformation. To close structure, add nodes to form triangles, enabling load transfer and internal force distribution.",

    "analysis": "Load at node_3 has components Fx = -10*cos(45°) = -7.07 N, Fy = -10*sin(45°) = -7.07 N downward. The truss requires vertical and lateral support reaction. Existing nodes are colinear, no inherent triangulation, so no closed path and insufficient stiffness. Adding at least one node above node_3 to form a triangle will introduce necessary vertical and lateral stability. Triangular formation ensures members are subjected primarily to axial forces, minimizing bending and stress concentrations. The members should be sized to keep stress ≤30 and mass ≤30. Higher area at primary load path members, smaller area at secondary members aids stress minimization. Triangulation also closes the structure to satisfy connectivity constraint.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "The truss must include node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 (load). Optimal is to place one node above node_3 on y-axis to create triangle: e.g., node_4 at (2, h). Triangle (node_1, node_4, node_2) or (node_1, node_4, node_3) will help distribute vertical and horizontal forces. Must avoid added complexity increasing mass over 30. Member lengths chosen to minimize total length while keeping structure stable. Area selection per member guided by stress demand; shortest members can have smaller areas.",

    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at midpoint above node_3 to form an isosceles triangle with base (node_1-node_2). This closed loop enhances stiffness and distributes load efficiently. Use larger areas on members from node_4 to supports to resist combined stresses. Base members can be smaller as mostly compression/tension with lower force magnitudes. Calculate member forces using static equilibrium. Area IDs: small for low force members (0.195 or 0.782), bigger for high force members (3.128 to 7.037). Ensure total mass ≤30 by summing length × area. Solve for node_4 y-coordinate to balance forces under constraints.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Coordinates: node_4 = (2.0, y4).
