    "preamble": "Optimize a 2D closed truss structure with 4 nodes. Current design has all members below stress and mass constraints, but mass is moderately high (25.27/30 limit) and peak stress is at 9.95/15. Objective is to further minimize max(abs(stress)), retaining constraint-compliance, ideally via gradual mass reduction and better stress distribution.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs specify load (-10.0 kN @ -45°) on node_3, pinned support at node_1, roller at node_2. Node positions: node_3 is at the loaded node (cannot move), node_1 and node_2 are support nodes (should not move). Initial structure triangularizes the panel but could allow non-uniform member areas or minor node_4 adjustment for efficiency.",
    
    "analysis": "Analysis shows the structure is statically determinate, with good load paths from node_3 (loaded) through node_4 (apex above load), distributing forces back to the base supports (node_1: pinned, node_2: roller). Members connecting between lower and upper (node_3–node_4) bear high compressive stress (-9.95, just under the -15 limit), but none are overstressed. Structure history shows prior attempts with more nodes/members have either excessive stress (45.3, 54.1) or more mass-inefficient layouts. Our current solution is compliant and appears close to optimal for mass–stress trade-off.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Current structure's max stress is in member_5 (-9.95), mass is under 30. Members 2 and 4 show more moderate stress (~3.4/8.3), hinting at possible area reduction. Slightly lowering mass could be achieved by trimming member sizes with sub-max stresses, while a modest adjustment to node_4 (the only free node) might better equalize load transfer and further balance stress.",
    
    "proposal": "Keep the current node layout for supports and load, but shift node_4 slightly upward to (2.0, 2.7) from (2.0, 2.5) to improve triangle geometry and strong paths above the loaded node—this can mildly lengthen and flatten the loaded panel, thus distributing the vertical component more efficiently. Systematically check if reducing member areas for all but most-stressed (e.g., potentially reduce member_2, _3, _6 from area_id '3' to '2') brings mass down below 25 while staying within 15 MPa stress constraint.",
    
    "reasoning": "Raising node_4 (non-restricted apex above loaded panel) increases triangle inclination, helping the top chord (node_3–node_4, member_4) handle vertical component more efficiently. Keeping node_1/node_2/node_3 fixed honors support/load locations and boundary constraints. By shrinking less-stressed members' areas (where <60% of the 15 MPa limit) the mass can be reduced directly without raising max(abs(stress)) above the accepted value.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume linear member stress response: stress ∝ force / area. Members with stress magnitudes less than ~6 (i.e. <40% limit) can have area reduced from area_id '3' (~1.8) to '2' (~0.78). New member forces recalc required if geometry is altered; expect small changes since only node_4 moves moderately. Tie all bottom nodes with diagonals, keep a closed upper triangle for stability and to prevent buckling.",
    
    "calculation": "Node_4 (free) repositioned to (2.0, 2.7) from (2.0, 2.5)—expected to lower the force in member_5 (the previous highest-west-stressed). For member areas: member_1 (was area_id '2', remains as loading is steady and moderate), member_2 and _3 (high but not maxed) reduced from area_id '3'(1.76) to '2'(0.782) as their max stresses should stay below 15. Member_4 or _5 warrant area_id '2'(0.782); if they are near prior stresses, can only reduce moderately. Mass recalculation: Summing new lengths × reduced areas, expect total mass drop to below 23. Minor nudge to member lengths—since only node_4-y moved 0.2m higher, overall system response maintains force balance and closes well.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Revalidate geometry is closed, all nodes in single structure, and areas only reduced where prior member_stress is <10. Maximum area reduction justified structurally; largest stressed member (previously -9.95) should remain just under 15 after higher apex lowers compressive demand. Total mass target is <25, stress <12, well within constraint. All nodes integer-labeled, no duplicates, all member–node references valid.",
