The goal is a feasible, efficient structure with all nodes fully connected under the AreaID set.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Current design fails with max(abs(stress))=15.12 (>15) with mass well below ceiling, so under-designed stretch-critical elements exist. Historical solutions show mass increases with stress reductions, yet triangularization helps optimal performance. Precise equilibrium and rigorous member choices are needed.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Key aspects: load on node_3 is -10kN at -45°, supports as described. Frequent violations arise from the mid-top node forming inadequate diagonals, making the most stressed member the (\'node_1\', \'node_3\')/(\'node_2\', \'node_3\') connections, possibly carrying significant compressive/tensile stress and projecting poorly relative to force application. Uses of medium sections led to compact mass, but at the loss of margin to failure. Top 2 performing historical layouts set ‘node_4’ near (3.5, 2.8/2.95), barycentric to supports and load, maximizing triangulated resolution of force into well-aligned ties and compressive elements, albeit with modest excess mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: All successful cases use basic quadrilateral bridged by diagonal triangulation, producing a traditional 2D Warren or N-truss. Diagonal members that avoid over-length with appropriate area find success. Raising ‘node_4’ ease diagonal angles (reduces projected force/stress), but excessive height (3.05) increases members length (mass) and can result in slack/overstressed diagonals.",\n    \n    "proposal": "To comply, I propose using the best historical topology (\'node_4\' ~ [3.5, 2.8]) but increase diagonal/vertical member areas in load-critical paths (especially those involving node_3: e.g., \'member_2\', \'member_3\', \'member_6\' connecting node_3) and cautiously increase area on direct top-chord/stabilizing elements. EPRA for members consistently >-15 or close to limit reveals need to replace \'2\'(0.782) with \'3\'(1.759) where necessary. We target stress below 15 and mass just under 30—thereby maximizing safety margin without excessive mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Placing \'node_4\' near [3.5, 2.80] creates a stable, nearly optimal triangle network. Increasing area selectively only at highly stressed members avoids needless mass and meets constraint. Ensuring diagonals and immediately adjacent base members aren\'t the minimum, especially where compression intensity is greatest, spreads loads and guards against buckling/failure at stressed nodes. All nodes remain structurally essential, satisfying closedness.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Young\'s modulus, cross-sections taken only from area_id dict. Forces resolved by basic statics: calculate member force F ≈ P × (load path projection / length), member stress = F/area. Considering prior stresses for \'2\': \'member_2\', \'member_3\', \'member_6\' ~ -15 are critical; thus, set as 3 (or 4). Members far underloaded retain \'2\', those significantly lighter (<10 abs(stress)) use minimum.
