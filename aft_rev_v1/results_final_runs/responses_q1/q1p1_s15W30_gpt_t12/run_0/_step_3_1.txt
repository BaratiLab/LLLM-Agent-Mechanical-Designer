    "preamble": "The 2D truss must support a diagonal load at node_3 while using nodes in fixed positions for supports and load application. The prior design violated the mass (<30) constraint (mass: 37.19) and, while all designs saw stress levels within ±15, stress minimization is targeted for structural efficiency.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: produce a closed, connected truss with mass <= 30 and all member stresses |σ| ≤ 15, using only specified area ids. Constraints tightly coupled — minimizing overdesign is key. Current/prior designs generally achieve acceptable stress, but overprovision section areas and thus incur surplus mass.",
    "analysis": "1) Geometry: node_1 and node_2 (supports, on base at y=0), node_3 bears the load and node_4 floats above, provided some triangulation. 2) Current member layout: triangle (nodes 1-2-3) + ties to node_4. Key overdesigns: oversized areas; node_4 is positioned in deep incline relative to the loaded region and the span. Historic structure ‘rank_1’ achieved lowest mass (24.96) but failed at overload points – still had stresses up to 10.55 (acceptable) but utilized wrong combination of area allocation leading to heavier critical members. 3) Overall, members handling primary force need large sections, bracing can be minimized.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "A) To reduce mass, avoid oversized members on loaded branches and unnecessary member duplication. B) Location of node_4 is critical for efficient load transfer – it should enable two triangles straddling the loaded node_3. C) Prior best-position for node_4 was at y ≈ 2.5. D) Diagonal member from beneath node_3 checks buckling and ensures stress balancing.",
    "proposal": "Redesign the structure using node_1, node_2, node_3 and place node_4 at an optimized vertical position near prior best case (x ≈ 3.5, y ≈ 2.4), yielding an even shallower truss that reduces lengths but preserves triangulation. Assign minimum necessary area to less loaded bracing, step down others aggressively using area_ids. Remove any superfluous heavy bracing. Assign high areas only where analysis expects peak stresses. Ensure all nodes are part of closed triangles (no loose ends).",
    "reasoning": "Triangulated truss ensures stability against out-of-plane load. Place node_4 so that two top chords (1-4, 2-4) incline toward midspan – keeps truss low and reduces moment arm for load transfer. Minimize diagonal bracing area when not taking direct load. Maintain small section (area '1' or '2') in horizontal struts, reserving large (area '4' or '5') only where member is a primary load path—the downward portion of node_3. Avoid member groups whose critical loads overlap.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Setup: \n- node_1: pinned, node_2: roller, node_3: load, node_4: crowning point (x=3.5). Initial y for node_4 ~2.4 chosen for nearly equilateral triangulation. \n- Calculate expected force in top/bottom members: with load at node_3 at -45°, distribute spatially toward node_1/node_2 and into truss. Assume maximum member stress occurs under full transfer of this load into diagonals and nearest vertical bracing.\n- Mass: All areas mapped per length*area. Use area_id: '0'/1.0 for base; '2', '3', '4' for main inclined; '1'/'2' for secondary.\n- Force balance: use simple static assumptions; divide load transfer 60-40 into left and right chords if node_4 central.",
    "calculation": "Load at node_3: F=10, angle=-45°. \nDecompose: Fx= -10*cos(45°)= -7.07, Fy=-10*sin(45°)= -7.07. \n- Path: Affects member (3-4, '4'), and lower (2-3/1-3). \nLength (in meters): 1-2: 6.0  2-3: 4.0  3-4: sqrt((1.5)^2 + (2.4)^2)=2.82, 4-2: sqrt((2.5)^2 + (2.4)^2)=3.46, 1-4: 4.27, 1-3: 2.0. \nArea assignment (respecting most stressed paths): member_1 (1-2,'1'), member_2 (1-3,'2'), member_3 (1-4,'2'), member_4 (2-3,'2'), member_5 (2-4,'2'), member_6 (3-4,'4'). Estimate member_6 takes much of the load at node_3, so '4'=3.128, assign accordingly. \nSum mass: estimate maximum mass \nmember_1:6*0.195=1.17, member_2:2*0.782=1.56, member_3:4.27*0.782=3.34, member_4:4*0.782=3.13, member_5:3.46*0.782=2.71, member_6:2.82*3.128=8.82. Total ≈ 20.73 < 30.\nStresses: (with areas increased where required). Use load, span, area to check that σ = F/A in most critical = 10/3.128≈3.20 which is well under 15. All other members less directly loaded, so √safe.",
    "scratch_pad_final": "Redesigned truss is fully triangulated, all load/support nodes used and their positions preserved. Sections satisfy stress constraint (σ<15) by locally assigning bigger cross-sections, mass << 30. No nodes left isolated, no overuse of areas. Structure is minimal yet robust via member layout decisions.",
