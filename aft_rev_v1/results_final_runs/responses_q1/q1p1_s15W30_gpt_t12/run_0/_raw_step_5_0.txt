The optimization goal is to find a structurally efficient, closed 2D truss meeting all constraints: max(|stress|) ≤ 15 and mass ≤ 30, while preserving loads/supports and connecting all nodes.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: Minimize |stress|≤15 and mass≤30 for a statically loaded, supported, planar truss (4 nodes). Challenges: Current design\'s member(s) exceeds |stress|=55.94, typically along the direct load member(s) or in compression, highlighting undersized critical elements or poorly distributed geometry. Key: Closed triangulated truss form, leverage area_id sizing for highly stressed members, use history for low-stress layouts even if heavier.",\n\n    "analysis": "The problematic member shown in the constraint_not_met_4 has |stress| at ~56—specifically, \'member_4\', likely the member carrying highest compressive force due to its geometry (spanning where the load is applied at node 3). The historic rank_1 structure, with a symmetric, nearly equilateral upper triangle, features far lower max |stress|=10.55 (with redundant triangulation via stronger member areas and better geometry), but at the cost of doubling the mass. All constraint-met attempts use relatively horizontal lower chords and an arching top member, providing redundant load paths and mitigating peak force. Constraint violation structures with small vertical or diagonally compressed interior members tend to focus the load—raising local |stress|.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key geometry/pattern: Triangulated top chord, diagonals, plus thicker lower chords minimize force magnitudes. Historic \'rank_1\' model, though heavier, is compliant. Excess mass primarily results from use of area_id \'4\' and \'3\' (large) across many members. Yet, since our mass limit is 30 and \'rank_1\' is 25, dropping selective member areas can further optimize mass while ensuring stress stays below 15. Priority: Reproduce \'rank_1\' node arrangement, trim over-sized members less loaded, and fine-tune upper node location for geometry, e.g. using [3.5, 2.4–2.5] for minimal/balanced force per geometric projection (avoid 2.35!).",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign based on proven \'rank_1\' geometry: asymmetric trapezoidal configuration with parallel lower chords, elevated apex, methodically sized members. Begin with \'rank_1\' node placements (nodes 1, 2, 3 fixed; node 4 at [3.5, 2.5]), verify full closure. Analyze member stress; use max-sized lower and mid-diagonals (area_id 2); size top chords with area_id 1 (less loaded). Downgrade over-specified verticals if possible. Result: Closed, strong, and material-efficient design meeting mass and |stress| criteria.",\n\n    "reasoning": "A closed triangle-on-chord truss uses triangulation for load redistribution. Support nodes fixed at ends, loaded node centered bottom, apex chosen by prior optimization ([3.5,2.5]). Resist maximum force with robust diagonals (those spanning from support/lower chord to apex), moderate lower and top chords (carry axial, less moment), set member areas by expected relative demand. Members with less calculated force are down-selected by area to trim overall mass.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Fix: node_1 at (0,0); node_2 at (6,0); node_3 at (2,0); node_4 near [3.5,2.5] (verified in best past design for stress moderation, or slightly adjust to ~2.45 for balance, but [3.5,2.5] avoids all suspect low-height/past failure cases). Top and bottom chords: area_id 1/2. Diagonals: area_id 3 where needed (if stress on diagonals < 15 with id 2 versus 3, test with 2 for mass; else 3). Verify equilibrium via method of joints. Target: mass ~18–26. Key calculations: span geometry (l = sqrt(Δx^2+Δy^2)); stress = force/(area), iterate if any member(s) over 15. Assign areas to minimize but not risk exceeding 15 (with margin).",\n\n    "calculation": "Repeat prior \'rank_1\' layout, but with selective area down-step. Historic data: all-stiffness \'rank_1\': max_stress 10.55 @ mass 24.96; member areas often larger than needed. Inspect individual member forces; if, in design, members peak near 10 (prior best), area can scale down by ~30–35% before approaching limit (10/0.42 ≈ 24→16). Diagonals and edge are loaded; set areas to \'2\' (~0.782), vertical and bottom can use \'1\' (0.195) where force < 3–4. Recalculate mass: e.g. (length × area) sum, aiming total ~20–22. All |stress| estimated ≤ 15; should hold since design was previously max(|stress|)=10.5 with all larger members. Members re-assigned area by force proportion.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "All nodes fully connected. Node positions all float, no inappropriate \'snapping.\' Members avoid duplicates, closed path enforced. Mass preferable near 20; no individual member with |stress|>15.
