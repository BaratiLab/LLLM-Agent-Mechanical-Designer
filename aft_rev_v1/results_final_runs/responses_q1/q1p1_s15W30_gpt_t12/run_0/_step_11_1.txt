    "preamble": "The optimization aims to create a closed 2D truss for given nodes and boundary/supports, with max(abs(stress)) ≤ 15, total mass ≤ 30. The previous structures failed to meet both or either criterion, especially with some over-stressed members and multiple 'constraint not met' cases. The objective is to reconfigure the truss or efficiently upgrade member areas to yield the lightest feasible structure without overstress.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs set loads at node_3 (-10 kN at 45° ↓←), with pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Existing and near-best historic design variants (see rank_1, rank_2, rank_3) have stresses 10.1~10.5 but with moderate-to-high masses. Constraint violations across others are usually member overstress, not insufficiency of area, and sometimes mass. Triangulated/closed arrangements perform best. Goal: fine tune/further close structure, manage force flows to ≤15 stress within ≤30 mass.",
    
    "analysis": "Current and prior designs use standard quadrilateral/triangular layouts with node_4 as the peak and node_3/1/2 manual placement. Often, high stress appears in diagonal or vertical members connecting node_1-3 or node_1-4, since node_3 is both loaded and forms the truss center 'web'. Mass is spent on thick upper or lower members to resist bending/shear, even as others remain under-used. Adding a fifth node above node_3 (say node_5) could create a brace, shortens force path, yielding a stronger triangle system and mitigating high compressive stress in members adjacent to loaded node_3. Area ids across the historical best designs show diagonals and loaded connections typically need '3' or higher; base can be '2' or below. Unwantedly high concentrations at one or two members have driven most constraint failures. Node positions were rarely varied systematically, mainly in y-direction at node_4 (proximity ~[3.5, 2.5~2.95]).",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Performance increases with a) increased bracing, esp. around node_3; b) improving triangulation in the loaded region; c) redistributing area assignments (giving more area to highly stressed members, optimizing others). Directly optimizing area between the load point (node_3) and both supports, plus reducing the effective length on critical diagonals, will improve safety while spreading stresses. No need for a complex fifth node; just fine-tune node_4's y-coord for improved force-angles and revise areas strategically.",
    
    "proposal": "Relying on the proven triangular layouts, let's optimize 'rank_2' (node_4 @ [3.5, 2.95]) which is nearly feasible. Its highest member stress is just above 10 (under constraint), and total mass is an efficient 24.4. Carefully increasing area for only the current most-stressed member_6 (node_3-node_4) from '2' to '3', and for member_4 (node_1–node_4) from '2' to '3' (which also had high utilization), should pull max stress below 10, well under ±15. Use heavier diagonals as needed; keep other areas low to meet the mass constraint. No additional nodes or major topology shift needed, as history/analysis indicate further gains would be minimal compared to careful member re-assignment.",
    
    "reasoning": "Load enters at node_3 and splits toward node_1, node_2 (support-prop), and node_4 (roof). High-angled diagonal (node_3-node_4) takes substantial force; so does mid-span (node_1-node_4), and top-braces. Making those thicker, while keeping rest lean, trianguates the loading path, maintains closure, and evenly spreads force. Short, direct bracing keeps lengths (hence mass) down, helping both criteria. Avoiding unnecessary conections to already-insensitive members maintains efficiency.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "From historical 'rank_2' fem_result: member_6 ('node_3','node_4','2'), -10.1441 stress—so, upgrading to area='3' (A_3=1.759×) will reduce stress by ≈(1.759/0.782)=2.25→new max stress ≈10.1/2.25=~4.5, easily passing. Similar logic applies to member_4. Compute new masses by scaling previous masses × (A_new/A_old), sum them, ensure ≤30. For drag, area scaling suffices (length unchanged). No coordinates are changed for loaded or supported nodes; node_4 keeps optimal y≈2.95.",
    
    "calculation": "1) For member_4: Was area '2' (0.782), up to '3' (1.759); prev mass 3.5795×(1.759/0.782)=8.065. 2) For member_6: replace area '2'(0.782)→'3'(1.759); prev mass 2.588×2.25=5.823. 3) Other members' area/mass unchanged (from previous design): member_1: area '2', mass: 4.692; member_2 and 3: area '3', masses 3.518, 7.036; member_5: area '2' (unchanged), mass 3.0239. New total mass = 4.692+3.518+7.036+8.065+3.0239+5.823 = 32.157 (SLIGHTLY OVER). Adjust member_4 to area '2', redo calculation. Try reducing member_6 partially if analysis allows. Actually, in prior runs, thinner upper node_3-node_4 members stayed just under 15, so use area '3' only in member_6, leave other changes minimal.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "To ensure both constraints: adjust only member_6 to area '3' (all other areas per rank_2). Now recalc: 4.692 (1–2) + 3.518 (1–3) + 7.036 (2–3) + 3.5795 (1–4) + 3.0239 (2–4) + (2.588×2.25=5.823) (3–4) = 27.67 (well within mass). Now, stress in member_6 was -10.14 at area '2', with new area ratio gives -10.14×(0.782/1.759)= -4.5 (compressive, not exceeding constraint). All remaining members were comfortably under ±15 in rank_2 with their given sizes. All connections are closed, no node is isolated. Thus, the structure is both feasible and efficient. Solution is close to 'rank_2', but with upper-right diag member thickened.",
