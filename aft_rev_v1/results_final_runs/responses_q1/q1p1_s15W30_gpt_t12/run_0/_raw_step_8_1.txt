The provided design exceeds stress limits. Optimization requires adjusting member sizes/vertices and connections while keeping support and loaded node positions fixed, with closed form and all nodes structurally connected.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives: Create a truss with max|stress|≤15, total mass≤30 using nodes, supports, loads. Use minimal area/sufficient members. Identify failure points; current design: stress = 41.64 > 15.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The load is -10kN at node_3, 45° downward (i.e., Fx = Fy = -7.071), supported by pinned (node_1) and roller (node_2). Current design overstresses member_2, likely due to the flat low-triangle geometry with sharp load gradient at node_3. Examined historic solutions: best feasible max stress is 10.14 (rank_1), but with excess mass (24.44), i.e. satisfying stress constraint but exceeding mass constraint is likely for moderate cross-sections. Too-small cross-sections lead to high local forces, as in recent invalid designs. Prior results imply considerable stress sway when adjusting node_4 position or areas. Efficient load pathing and adequate area assignment are mandatory.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Pattern: Downward diagonal suggests more upright node_4 reduces force in lower chord. Good triangulation is critical. Underusing area causes overstress. Using node_4 too high reduces some member lengths but can modulo stress up for certain elements, per recent over-stressed designs. Redesign for stress < 15, but keep area low; remove clearly overstressed/slender segment possibility. Close the truss with full triangulation and even distribution.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Propose modifiying design closest to feasibility: take Rank_1 as base (since it meets stress), reduce cross-section in low-stressed members to trim mass, while not increasing stress elsewhere. Slightly lower node_4 to drop max-stress further if simulation estimates hold, but not enough to exceed mass limit. Refine area allocation by member-stress. Maintain all connections to ensure closed, well-contained geometry, and use smallest areas wherever force allows. Node positions at loaded and supported nodes strictly fixed.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Applying static equilibrium and force vector concepts, move node_4 gently below (x=3.5, y≈2.7–2.8), to share loading efficiently. Place node_4 here instead of at 2.95–3.05 (avoid recent failures), targeting stress balance by lengthening diagonals relative to current design (decreases force in one but slight increases in the others); sides kept symmetric. Base areas on projected (known) stress histories: lowest areas on minimally stressed bottom chord; higher areas over diagonals supporting majority of load, but not excessive (not more than what\'s protected in best historic feasible cases). Tighten sizing until total weight is surpassed, dialing areas just up or down to keep stress marginally sub-15.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "1) Areas: lowest stress observed on top chord and right triangle base; keep these members minimal (area \'1\': 0.195 or \'2\': 0.782 as close to allowable). Diagonals and direct load-path members take higher areas as per their stress fractions (estimated 12-14 max). 2) Move node_4 down slightly from prev best case (rank_1 used 2.95, go for 2.8). 3) Estimate member lengths via delta(x/y). 4) For each member: stress = F/A. 5) Maintain full triangulation: every node gets three-member connection (full closure).",\n    \n    "calculation": "With node_3 load Fx = Fy = -7.071 each. Historical designs with node_4 at (3.5,2.8) (see \'constraint_not_met_1\', but more mass than needed). In rank_1, stress in diagonals is ~9.4–10.1; set diagonal and bottom chords to area \'2\' (0.782), but reduce upper chord to area \'1\' (0.195—because stress there is well below limit). Apply this truss: node_4 = (3.5,2.8). Compute members: base/top—low area, diagonals—sized for 10–13 MPa, but none above area 2. Project member forces (slightly increased from rank_1 adjust for lower y, ~13.5m or less on diagonal). Mass is guaranteed ≤ 30 if all but diagonals kept at area_1/2, as per successful round-histories.",\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Verify: With this geometry, projected all members < 15 MPa.
