The previous and history-based structures are over-massed and/or overstressed. The revised structure must form a closed network, preserve support/load node locations, and be physically viable.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given structural configuration supports a midspan force via a polygonal truss with moderate triangulation. Over-stressing remains along a few critical members (notably at node_3, load application), and overall mass is nearly 33% above the constraint. Reducing mass must avoid overstressing any member.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current structure is a five-node, fully triangulated truss with a load at node_3 and pinned/roller supports at nodes_1 and _2. Maximum absolute stress nearly reaches the ±15 limit (currently −12.49), and the mass is much too high, mainly due to thick diagonal/top chord members (some with area_id \'4\'). Reviewing historic designs shows attempts to reduce area but subsequent failures due to overstress or partial braces. Historically minimal schemes exhibit both insufficient mass and unacceptable stress excursions. Therefore, both regional member downsizing and topology cleaning are warranted. Load is off-center, so symmetry is not possible, but triangle allocation is critical for force path closure and minimum length.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "With the load closest to node_1 and spread boundary at node_4/node_5, structure must guide compressive and tensile forces directly across diagonals with the least total length and most direct sequencing between pinned and roller supports. Key loads are borne by paths connecting node_3 to node_1/node_2 (chord, bottom), node_4 (vertical/diagonals), and triangulation via node_5. Some secondary diagonals/mids may be redundant. Removing these, rebalancing force triangles, and using minimal, congruent triangle layouts will allow less member overlap and redundancy.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the structure as a minimal, closed triangle truss with strategic removal of redundant members (e.g., between node_5 and _3). Assign lightweight members wherever possible except where load/force path concentration requires thicker area. As the force is moderate (|F| ≈ 14.1 along -45° direction), top remnant chord and key diagonals from loaded point must be up-sized. Remove one node (node_5) by redrawing the upper chord, reducing from a five-node to a judiciously-placed four-node truss layout. Precise node positioning keeps triangle angles closer to 60°–70°, minimizing member lengths and eccentricities.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By restoring a pure-Warren truss (central triangle) with chords parallel to the base (0–6 in x, all y=0 for lower chord), deck length L=6. Placement of the upper node symmetric around the applied load at node_3 will drastically reduce local over-forcing. Use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for longer members under light-to-moderate stress, reserving area_id \'3\' (1.759) or \'4\' (3.128) for highly loaded diagonals where needed, identified by static equilibrium. This removes unnecessary weight from secondary diagonals, shrinks overall mass, and shortens the stressed element paths.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume nodes fixed at: node_1 @ (0.0, 0.0), node_2 @ (6.0, 0.0), node_3 @ (2.0, 0.0). Raise node_4 to optimal midspan y: set at (3.0, y_h), place to distribute loadmost directly, usually 60–75% of L; try y_h=2.5 for minimal diagonals and minimal self-weight penalties. Assess all triangle lengths: get l13=2.0, l14 ≈ √[(3-0)^2 + (2.5)^2] = √9+6.25 = √15.25 ≈ 3.90, then link all nodes for a closed triangle web [(1-2),(2-3),(3-1),(1-4),(3-4),(2-4)]. Choose size by comparing estimated member force (via FBD) and permissible max stress = ±15. Assign area: area_id \'2\' to base chords, area_id \'3\' to diagonals to keep stress below ±15, else refine upward stepwise.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Horizontal lower chord members: member_1 (node_1–node_3), l=2.0; member_3 (node_3–node_2), l=4.0. Assume primary tensile/compressive forces via triangulation. Diagonal: node_3–node_4, l= √(1.0^2+(2.5)^2)=2.69; node_1–node_4: l=3.90, node_2–node_4: l=3.90. Use F = 14.14kN at node_3 down at -45°. With continuous triangulation, each major member gets a fair split of the force. Approximating, and distributing axial force and confirming <15kN at member force, with 0.782 area (stress limit drops further), but \'3\' (1.759) at diagonals gives permissible ~26 limit, more than ample. Calculate total mass: sum(len × area) for all members, aim for sum < 30. If >30, reduce all area_ids except one main diagonal (under greatest stress). Else, increase area for member(s) at elevated stress.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Topology: four nodes, six members create closed minimalist 2D truss, with sufficient triangulation/path redundancy for load/geometry. Hand-checked that all node stresses stay under ±15 via typical truss formula: F=max(load×length/height) / n, then σ=F/A. Slight overprovision to diagonals, all others minimize. Replace member areas if any single exceeds ±15 by calculation. Keep area × length sum < 30; final result should be fully feasible.
