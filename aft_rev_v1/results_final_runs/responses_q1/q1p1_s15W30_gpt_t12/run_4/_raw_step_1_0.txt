All member stresses must be within ±15, and total mass ≤ 30. Existing design violates the stress constraint. Task: Redesign for constraint satisfaction and minimum mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Restate problem and consider failure points: Current truss stress limit violated (max 34.91 > 15). Mass (9.87) is well under 30, so larger/thicker/stronger members could be acceptable if stress reduced. Node/support and load geometry fixed for supports (node_1 and node_2) and load (node_3). Failed member: member_5 with 34.91 stress, acting as top chord from node_1 to node_4.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Layout: Topped triangle (nodes 1/2/4) and loaded third node at bottom chord (node_3, mid-bottom), standard for supporting off-center downward point loads. Status: main diagonal (member_5) critically stressed; some lower members lightly stressed (-1.7 to -13.9). Closing the structure could involve adding a horizontal top member or a bottom triangle. Geometry seems under-triangulated for off-center loads, so certain members overly loaded—lack of redundancy/alternate path.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The high stress is in the diagonal (node_1–node_4): indicates insufficient direct/triangulated load path to relieve force at node_4: force transmitted from loaded node_3 (near one support) through node_4 (apex); main diagonals = high tension/compression. To lower stress: (1) Add more triangulation (especially at the top), (2) Maybe add a top horizontal member (node_4 to between node_1/node_2), (3) Strengthen stressed member. Area_id selections have slack, so increasing member area is reasonable, but triangulation improvement best as first step.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign to increase redundancy—transform internal triangle into a Warren or K-truss arrangement, adding a fifth node at the mid-top. Add member node_5 at midpoint between node_1 and node_2 at y=1.44 (halved from apex). Close any open triangles at top and bottom and ensure all nodes included. Choose mid to large area_ids for most stressed members. Confirm all primary load paths are triangulated without introducing crossing (noding mistakes).",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Structural reasoning: Under eccentric, inclined load at node_3, maximum stress occurs where load must \'turn the corner\' (from bottom to top chord by diagonal). Triangular (truss) arrangements best transfer load via short, straight tension/compression members. Adding top horizontal (node_5) closes circuit and splits force path. K- or Warren-type additions at upper region keep mass low while distributing/complementing the heavily loaded diagonal with new force paths. If member area alone is increased instead, mass increases fast—triangulation gives more efficient stress relief.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume span length 6 (node_1 <-> node_2), height 2.88 (existing c), plan to add node_5 at (3.0, h/2 = 1.44). New members: node_4-node_5, node_5-node_1, node_5-node_2. Check lengths via sqrt((dx)^2 + (dy)^2). Push stressed member_5 (node_1-node_4) to higher area_id, replace pure diagonal with K-style web: node_3 to node_5 and node_4, node_5 to node_2 and node_1. For loads: all support nodes and loaded node keep their positions. Use moderate areas (id: 3~4 for diagonals, 1~2 for short chords). Confirm areas via projected member force (prelim analysis) and desired safety margin. Calculate preliminary stresses via sum F=0 at each node: triangulate free body diagrams— especially node_4 and node_3.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Sheet: Positions calculated (new node_5 at (3.0,1.44)). Members/areas set. Stress per member: Load at node_3 split between members (primarily upier triangle); support reactions resolved given boundary types; stress estimation (max ~10 under distributed path). Shorter overloaded diagonal now reinforced by alternate (member_7 node_4-node_5 and member_8 node_3-node_5). All member lengths computed. Mass sum calculated; area selection set so total < 30. Chosen: member_1, (bottom chord), member_7 (node_4-node_5) get highest; diagonals and short K-struts get mid-low. Sketch preliminary sums: all fit under constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Double-check design: All nodes used, all structurally connected; load and supports at fixed locations.
