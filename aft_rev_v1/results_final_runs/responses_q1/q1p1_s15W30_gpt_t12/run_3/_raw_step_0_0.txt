The structure must support a downward/directional load (-10 kN at -45°) on node_3, with node_1 pinned and node_2 roller-supported, using specific cross-sectional areas. The objective is to create a closed, triangulated truss that minimizes maximal element stress and stays under total mass and stress constraints, optimizing connectivity and direct load-path efficacy.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three nodes: pinned at (0,0), roller at (6,0), load applied at (2,0). Constraints are ±15 stress and total mass ≤ 30. All members must use area IDs from table; only three initial nodes exist, so at least one extra node is needed for structural triangulation/closure.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The direct load at node_3 (-10, -45°) induces significant moments about the support line. With this geometry, only a single triangle can be formed with three nodes. Since all are collinear, direct triangulation is not possible—thus, a 4th node (preferably \'above\' the baseline) is vital. Placing node_4 at (2.0, 2.5) symmetrically (midspan, elevated) maximizes triangulation, distributes forces evenly, and precludes unbraced spans.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Avoiding member overlap and ensuring statically determinate closure recommends completing the triangle through above-midspan elevation at node_4. All three nodes connect to node_4, completing a closed structure (truss). Focus on aligning key members with principal force direction, using justified area selections. Mass must remain low; avoid very large area elements.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Placing node_4 directly above node_3 avoids unnecessary lever arms, keeping vertical reactions manageable. Members will be: node_1-node_2 (base), node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4 (vertical), and node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3 for closure and load-path completion. All force paths become short and nearly axial under primary actions, minimizing outstanding moments. Select modest-to-small member areas with heavier duty (i.e., load-path) elements sized up.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: E = 1 (unitless, since only relative values matter), all joints pinned, adequately rigid, no buckling in code. Area table yields relative weights. Will analyze: forces in members under unit loading via method of joints/cut, assign smallest area consistent with stress < ±15, then sum (length × area) mass, targeting ≤30. Anticipate largest demand along chords (base) and diagonals carrying major component of load. Chord spans from (0,0) to (6,0). Node_4 at (2, 2.5). Members: node_1–node_2, node_1–node_4, node_2–node_4, node_3–node_4, node_1–node_3, node_2–node_3 establish equilibrium and enclosure.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Step 1: Compute geometry. \\\n    - Lengths: node_1-node_2 = 6.00 units; node_1-node_4 ≈ sqrt((2-0)^2+(2.5-0)^2)=3.20; node_2-node_4 ≈ sqrt((6-2)^2+(2.5-0)^2)=4.72; node_1-node_3=2, node_2-node_3=4. \\\n    All relevant members included. Compute joint equilibrium with applied load (-10 at -45°, so Fx=Fy=-7.071 at node_3). Method of joints for node_3: major vertical demand resolved in node_3-node_4 (acts steeply upwards directly counteracting downward load); diagonals handle part; base transfers to supports. To keep stress < ±15: maximize area for node_3-node_4 (where largest shear is present), reduce for lightly loaded base/diagonals. Assign area_4 (3.128) [from \'4\'] to node_3–node_4 (vertical, loaded), area_2 (0.782) to secondary diagonals, area_1 (0.195) to closure member (e.g., node_1–node_3), and area_3 (1.759) to the base. Check total mass: \\\n    base(6.00×1.759)=10.554, node_1–node_4(3.20x0.782)=2.502, node_2–node_4(4.72×0.782)=3.692, node_3–node_4(2.5×3.128)=7.82, node_1–node_3(2×0.195)=0.39, node_2–node_3(4×0.195)=0.78. Sum=10.554+2.502+3.692+7.82+0.39+0.78≈25.74 (<30). Estimate member force: vertical tie node_3-node_4 handles most of -10 (full load split via triangle geometry), resulting in member force within ~10–12 magnitude. With area =3.128, stress=10/3.128≈3.2 < 15, all other member forces proportionally lower (<7/0.782≈9. That is valid).",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Node selection and member assignments ensure closed, triangulated, statically determinate truss.
