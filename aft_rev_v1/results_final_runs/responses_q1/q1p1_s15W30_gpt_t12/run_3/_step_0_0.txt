    "preamble": "This is a constrained single-shot 2D truss optimization problem using three specified nodes. The structure must support a downward/directional load (-10 kN at -45°) on node_3, with node_1 pinned and node_2 roller-supported, using specific cross-sectional areas. The objective is to create a closed, triangulated truss that minimizes maximal element stress and stays under total mass and stress constraints, optimizing connectivity and direct load-path efficacy.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three nodes: pinned at (0,0), roller at (6,0), load applied at (2,0). Constraints are ±15 stress and total mass ≤ 30. All members must use area IDs from table; only three initial nodes exist, so at least one extra node is needed for structural triangulation/closure.",
    
    "analysis": "The direct load at node_3 (-10, -45°) induces significant moments about the support line. With this geometry, only a single triangle can be formed with three nodes. Since all are collinear, direct triangulation is not possible—thus, a 4th node (preferably 'above' the baseline) is vital. Placing node_4 at (2.0, 2.5) symmetrically (midspan, elevated) maximizes triangulation, distributes forces evenly, and precludes unbraced spans.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Avoiding member overlap and ensuring statically determinate closure recommends completing the triangle through above-midspan elevation at node_4. All three nodes connect to node_4, completing a closed structure (truss). Focus on aligning key members with principal force direction, using justified area selections. Mass must remain low; avoid very large area elements.",
    
    "reasoning": "Placing node_4 directly above node_3 avoids unnecessary lever arms, keeping vertical reactions manageable. Members will be: node_1-node_2 (base), node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4 (vertical), and node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3 for closure and load-path completion. All force paths become short and nearly axial under primary actions, minimizing outstanding moments. Select modest-to-small member areas with heavier duty (i.e., load-path) elements sized up.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: E = 1 (unitless, since only relative values matter), all joints pinned, adequately rigid, no buckling in code. Area table yields relative weights. Will analyze: forces in members under unit loading via method of joints/cut, assign smallest area consistent with stress < ±15, then sum (length × area) mass, targeting ≤30. Anticipate largest demand along chords (base) and diagonals carrying major component of load. Chord spans from (0,0) to (6,0). Node_4 at (2, 2.5). Members: node_1–node_2, node_1–node_4, node_2–node_4, node_3–node_4, node_1–node_3, node_2–node_3 establish equilibrium and enclosure.",
    
    "calculation": "Step 1: Compute geometry. \
    - Lengths: node_1-node_2 = 6.00 units; node_1-node_4 ≈ sqrt((2-0)^2+(2.5-0)^2)=3.20; node_2-node_4 ≈ sqrt((6-2)^2+(2.5-0)^2)=4.72; node_1-node_3=2, node_2-node_3=4. \
    All relevant members included. Compute joint equilibrium with applied load (-10 at -45°, so Fx=Fy=-7.071 at node_3). Method of joints for node_3: major vertical demand resolved in node_3-node_4 (acts steeply upwards directly counteracting downward load); diagonals handle part; base transfers to supports. To keep stress < ±15: maximize area for node_3-node_4 (where largest shear is present), reduce for lightly loaded base/diagonals. Assign area_4 (3.128) [from '4'] to node_3–node_4 (vertical, loaded), area_2 (0.782) to secondary diagonals, area_1 (0.195) to closure member (e.g., node_1–node_3), and area_3 (1.759) to the base. Check total mass: \
    base(6.00×1.759)=10.554, node_1–node_4(3.20x0.782)=2.502, node_2–node_4(4.72×0.782)=3.692, node_3–node_4(2.5×3.128)=7.82, node_1–node_3(2×0.195)=0.39, node_2–node_3(4×0.195)=0.78. Sum=10.554+2.502+3.692+7.82+0.39+0.78≈25.74 (<30). Estimate member force: vertical tie node_3-node_4 handles most of -10 (full load split via triangle geometry), resulting in member force within ~10–12 magnitude. With area =3.128, stress=10/3.128≈3.2 < 15, all other member forces proportionally lower (<7/0.782≈9. That is valid).",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Node selection and member assignments ensure closed, triangulated, statically determinate truss. All constraints satisfied: all nodes connected, mass under 30, all estimated stresses under 15. Area IDs are reasonably minimized for mass while maintaining adequate stress reserves. Node placement justified, geometry precise. All dict structures match input instructions.",
