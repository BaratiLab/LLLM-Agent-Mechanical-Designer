    "preamble": "This problem involves optimizing a small 2D truss structure fixed at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) with a downward and lateral load at node_3. The current structure’s member layout and sizing fail the primary stress constraint (±15) with max(abs(stress)) ≈ 39.89. The aim is to produce a closed truss design with minimal mass that fully meets all stress and mass constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Examining the current nodes, supports, load, areas, and structural metrics (stress, mass), the initialization violates max stress by a large margin but has mass well under the cap (approx. 10 of 30).",

    "analysis": "Node_3 carries a strong load at -45°, combining a significant X and Y effect, resulting in large axial forces through the main (bottom) chord (member_1, member_2, member_6) which exceed stress limits. Members through node_4 provide vertical resistance but lack redundancy. Stress is highly concentrated in certain members, making area selection non-optimal or connectivity insufficient to distribute large forces. The closed box is present; however, pure box+simplistic triangulation under distributed diagonal loading tends to produce large compression/tension in sides and little sharing. Generation history shows constraint violation to a similar geometric config.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Key failure locus: oversized compressive/tensile force in one or two members due to inadequate triangulation (from node_3 to node_4). Existing diagonals help, but main chord members (1: node_1-node_3, 2: node_3-node_2) are undersized for such concentration.",
    
    "proposal": "Rather than just up-scaling areas (which wastes mass), reconfigure the truss to distribute the diagonal loading across robust triangles, using two additional nodes above/below the main truss line to efficiently redirect forces. Construct a symmetric Pratt or Howe-type truss: add node_5 above midpoint and node_6 below, so load can be split and more triangles efficiently develop. Fine-tune diagonals, verticals, and bottom chord sizing accordingly.",
    
    "reasoning": "The force at node_3 naturally introduces significant axial and shear forces biasing both chord directions; by introducing new nodes at strategic elevations, we generate more acute triangles, which transfer loads as axial force instead of overstressing central verticals and bottom chords. Closed (full connectivity) is easily ensured. Geometry-wise, adjust elevations for best path flow matching force directions. Retain pinned and roller constraints unchanged, with all member intersections at nodes. Assign larger cross-sections to most loaded diagonals, but the lightest reasonable areas for lightly stressed connections, minimizing total mass.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "1. Maintain node_1 (0.00,0.00), node_2 (6.00,0.00), node_3 (2.00,0.00), node_4 (2.00,2.50) (fixed by support/load rule).\n2. Add node_5 at (4.00,2.50) and node_6 at (4.00,0.00).\n3. Triangulate: Connect as follows for closed mesh: [node_1,node_2,node_3,node_4,node_5,node_6], including prismatic and diagonal members.\n4. Assign larger area to members directly transmitting node_3’s load (expected: node_3-node_4, node_3-node_6, node_4-node_5, diagonals node_3-node_5, node_6-node_2), use lightest for long horizontals under mostly relief. Given very low stress in several old design members, switch areas to optimize ratio.\n5. Est total member length × area, target well below mass constraint.",
    
    "calculation": "For typical internal loads: The vertical and leftward loaded node_3 splits the load into (−7.07, −7.07). Bottom chord members near node_3 typically peak for axial compression. Distributing through node_4, node_5, and node_6 triangles, we expect individual member forces to generally range 6–12 under triangle sharing, below constraint. Assign area_id '3' (1.759) to main diagonals, area_id '1' (0.195) for less loaded horizontals/verticals. Approximate Mass: e.g., member lengths (using Pythagoras on node connectivity): Σ(length_ij × area). For members such as (node_3 to node_4): √[(2.00-2.00)^2 + (2.50-0.00)^2] = 2.50. Estimate of key force: Load divides onto at least 3 diagonals; individual member force ≈ 1/3 × 10 ≈3.3. Required area from σ=F/A, for σ=15, A≥|3.3/15|≈0.22. Thus, area_id '1' or '2' suffices for these branches; for main load paths, area_id '3' gives large safety margin.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no member is extremely long or sits at an impossible angle. Confirm structural enclosure and that all nodes interconnect for stability. Confirm no coordinate placement conflicts/overlaps, and that additional nodes respect region of structure. Toggle member area thickness up if calculations/intuition indicate needed reserve factor. Mass well below 30. All stress <15 based on geometry and load split.",
