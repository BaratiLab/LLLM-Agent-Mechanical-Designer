The current design isn\\u2019t at the mass limit, but its maximum stress (7.42) could be lower; prior history shows lighter options often over-stressed, indicating geometry/area tuning is critical.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Analyzing current solution: Standard n=5 triangularized shape, wide spread especially node_4/node_5, areas >minimum everywhere, no constraint violations but stressed members near supports and loaded node. Objective: Use node locations/area for better stress spread while matching all constraints. Test if node tweaks lower stress, swap high-stress lowest-load-path members for lighter section if needed.",\n    "analysis": "The truss Assembly appropriately triangulates the loaded zone, main load path is from node_3 (loaded, not fixed) to supports at node_1 and node_2 via near-straight and bent links (node_4 / node_5). The limiting stress (7.42, member_3), though safe, reflects stress / global geometry mismatch. The history shows: Oversized areas/very large members only swap stress reduction for costly weight; trusses which are more vertical near the loaded node often lower local stress, but at cost of mass (\\u2265 37 at lowest-stress alternative), while minimalist triangular forms can dramatically exceed allowable stress even if light enough. By this, geometry adjustment focused at node_4 and node_5 (like slightly raising both) generally smooths force flow and can trim peak stress, but needs careful reconnect to keep the structure closed and efficient. Currently, all constraints are met, but structural efficiency (lowest possible stress with less or equal weight) could be improved until mass=constraint or more stress reduction is not possible with reasonable design.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Observing pattern\\u2014less horizontal tie in node_4 (closer to vertical, up-and-in toward node_3), and node_5 (move up pursuing balance of triangle height/lateral stiffness) both lower extreme member stress. Watch for risk of growing too tall (increasing mass or weak diagonals if too thin), but gently move nodes_4,5 upward and inward to enhance load elimination by compression/tension pairs rather than overly long, bending-prone spars.",\n    "proposal": "Retouch current structure: fix supports and load node positions. Raise node_4 slightly (y=2.7, x=2.8), and shift node_5 up-and-in (approx x=4.3, y=2.6) for better triangulation. Investigate if any non-critical links serve only redundancy and can be switched to smallest area. Review area assignment\\u2014reallocate largest (id \'3\') only to primary horizontal ties (where member_1, member_2 face load directly), others drop to id \'1\', except those near node_3 (target id \'2\' or \'1\'). Structure stays closed, all members included.",\n    "reasoning": "Classic statics plus FEM show that peak compressive/tensile stresses are highest where load path bends abruptly, e.g., node_3\\u2192node_4 and node_1\\u2192node_4. Elevate node_4 for vertical stress relief, and move node_5 upwards and slightly left to balance truss halves (optimal area utilization). Retain principal members (\\u201cspine\\u201d) size, downsize lateral/off-diagonal links as feasible to reduce total mass, ensuring that their expected stress based on force paths isn\\u2019t surge (look for reaction/freed node connections from tabulated outputs).",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assess original stress hot-spots (node_3 off-horizontal, member_3, member_1, member_4).
