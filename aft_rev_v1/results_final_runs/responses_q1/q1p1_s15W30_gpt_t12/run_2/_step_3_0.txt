    "preamble": "Given a loaded 2D truss spanning nodes with a support arrangement and an off-center downward-force at node_3, the previous structures have excessive member stresses or unnecessarily high masses. The aim is to optimize a *closed*, lightweight truss with max |stress| ≤ 15 and total mass ≤ 30, keeping all current support- and force-locations fixed.",
  
    "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives: relieve over-stressed members (currently up to 39), reduce mass if possible, maintain or improve triangle connectivity for rigidity. *Closed* implies no unattached node. Low-stress but massive attempts in history highlight overuse of material; need a better balance between stress and weight.",

    "analysis": "Current trouble: members to node_4 and its configuration concentrate force paths, causing excessive tension and compression (>±15). Constrained solutions with higher cross-sections significantly exceed mass (e.g., 37.4) but have controlled stresses. The geometry with node_4 (3,2.5) does not triangulate with node_3 effectively, leaving weak diagonals. Generation history with more nodes (node_5) distributed forces better but at cost of mass. Nearly minimal triangles need stiffer lower members; quadrilaterals without proper bracing greatly amplify member forces due to load eccentricity. Members close to ‘roller’ and ‘pinned’ supports are under low strain while long diagonals overshoot stress limit.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Key pattern: geometry with single off-axis node (node_4 @ [3,2.5]) forms long diagonals with high internal leverage. Local thickening cannot offset this—adding a second top node (making a Pratt or Warren configuration) could triangulate force paths and equalize stress distribution. Note: We cannot reposition nodes with supports/loads. Finer triangulation and strategic area_id assignment are critical. Adding a median top node above node_3, one at [4,2.5] (new node_5), while slightly moving node_4 to correct lever load could improve load diffusion at reasonable cost. Use higher areas only where necessary. All connections need triangles (no sole horizontal/vertical links on the top chord). Minimize number of long members by splitting longer spans.",

    "proposal": "Design a 5-node Warren/Pratt-style closed truss, placing new node_5 symmetrically to right of node_4, creating a triangular mesh with horizontally-braced upper chord. All upper nodes connect to node_3 for load partition. Triangulate with inclined diagonals between (node_1, node_4), (node_3, node_4), (node_3, node_5), (node_2, node_5), and tie all corresponding base nodes. Assign area_ids: mid-size (3: 1.759 or 4:3.128) for high-force diagonals, minimal (1:0.195 or 2: 0.782) for short, low-load links; check stress and mass iteratively.",

    "reasoning": "Warren trusses efficiently distribute angled loads, minimizing peak member force. Additional top-chord node and bracing split hysteretic force, limiting moment-arm reach of the main diagonals. Members near node_3 need larger areas; farther horizontal/short members can use lighter sections. Close upper nodes improve force diffusion but add little to mass if their connecting bracing is short. Ensure both triangulation and all nodes are involved. Avoid open quadrilaterals that lead to large deflection and high force.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Set-up for calculations: Positions—node_4 at (2.6,2.4), node_5 at (4.45,2.2). Members: Connect (node_1, node_3), (node_2, node_3), (node_1,node_4), (node_3,node_4), (node_3,node_5), (node_2,node_5), (node_4,node_5) and (node_1,node_5),(node_2,node_4) for extra redundancy if feasible. Cross-section: try area_id '3' (1.759) for high-force lower/diagonal members, '2' elsewhere. Approximate the key member forces using classical method-of-joints (relevant angles: atan2(2.4,2.6)~0.75rad), and choose smallest area_id with stress ≤15. Total member masses from area*length. Adjust until both constraints satisfied.",

    "calculation": "Key diagonals (node_3 to node_4/node_5 and node_1 to node_4, node_2 to node_5) take about half vertical force (~7.1 kN divided across two, ~3.5 kN per). For ~2.6m length diagonals, stress = force/area; with area_id 3 (1.759), stress = 3.5/1.759 ≈ 2.0 (well under 15); for even less, try '2', stress = 3.5/0.782 ≈ 4.5—acceptable. Lower chords and main diagonals, due to out-of-plane force, may take greater force; keep '3' or use '4' if still high after estimate. Total member length sum: Estimate ~18-20m (with seven members ~2.5m, three ~6m; check sum being 18m). With multiple '2' and a few '3', mass ≈ 0.782×12 + 1.759×6 = 9.38+10.55= ~19.9. All under 30, stress ceiling OK.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "Final check: five carefully positioned nodes, multiple triangulated connections, no inactive node, all connections needed to avoid open quadrilateral and stabilize the truss. Assign area_id '2' (0.782) to most, '3' (1.759) to bottom chords (node_1-node_3-node_2), where both support and load act. Calculate member stresses explicitly, verify for all ≤15. Check member mass sum <30. No logic violated. Coordinates precise (to two decimals). 'node_1', 'node_2', 'node_3' fixed; 'node_4' at (2.6,2.4), 'node_5' at (4.45,2.2). Remove nonfunctional or duplicate members.",
