Existing designs violate the mass constraint and realize excessive max stresses. Objective: Generate the lightest, statically admissible, closed-frame that satisfies max(|stress|) ≤ 15 and mass ≤ 30, using only permitted cross-section area IDs.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Requirements are clear: reconstruct or redesign so both stress and weight constraints are met. Pin at 1, roller at 2, load at 3; keep those locations. Prior results show moderately optimized/prismatic forms with some non-optimal internal bracing. Reach the lightest, feasible, triangulated layout and minimal cross-sections yet no overload.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current truss (5 nodes, 9 members), is dense but inefficient, overshooting the mass constraint (37.4 > 30) and showing some members overloaded close to negative limit (min: -5.97). Key loading is an inclined (-10, -45deg: 7.07kN in each x and y) on node_3, requiring decent internal triangulation for balanced transfers. Structure history demonstrates that shedding members too aggressively cuts stress headroom (prev design with 5 bars: min -16.28). Inferior cross-section optimization and over-redundancy. Efficiency = closed triangle/symmetry, minimal bars, select larger sections only where demonstrably required by statics. Bracing both vertical and diagonals is critical.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation is crucial: truss with just enough members adds redundancy (closure, lowers stresses) but too many greatly increases mass. Current member \'2\' area ID is 0.782: try reducing for side/vertical members; retain higher for the chord spanning under highest load. If possible, reposition nodes to regularize angles (place node_4 mid-top above loaded node_3; keep geometry moderate for best force resolution). K-frame or modified Warren is promising.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign using only four nodes, positioned for optimal load distribution and minimal member count: nodes 1 and 2 fixed; node_3 at load; node_4 high above span, forming a squat triangle. Join diagonal and verticals, include top-chord for closure. Use smallest possible area for vertical/closure members, reserve greater for heavy chord/diagonal if required. Use symmetry: all connections resolved such that vertical/horizontal/diagonal share stress uniformly; anticipate using 0.782 or smaller areas except for most compressed/tensile bars (chord and under node_3), requiring area id=2 or 3. Structure becomes a minimal, classic, doubly-redundant truss.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Statics: The load at node_3 can be-efficiently taken by an upper vertical (node_4) coupled to node_1 and node_2. Diagonal braces from node_4 to each support resolve push-pull; horizontal bottom chord from 1→3→2 manages the tie and closure. Classic \'triangular truss\': node_4 at [3.0, 2.5], above midspan, reduces span between supports and distributes force over small triangulated bays. Lowest possible member/force ratio with all members loaded, no isolate. Default to 0.195 area (id: \'1\') except for chords adjacent to loaded node; use result-informed increase (id: \'2/3\') as needed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "For each member: F = (external force via geometry reveals balance, take joints 1/3/4) ⇒ use vector/statics to get axial force. σ = |F|/A; member mass = L*A.
