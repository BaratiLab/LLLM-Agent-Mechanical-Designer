Load acts at -10, -45°. Constraints: Connect all nodes in a closed form, possibly with an internal node for a triangle, select areas to achieve required loads without overdesign. Find a balanced form that creates nearly triangle susbtructure with optimal area selection.",\n\n    "analysis": "Nodes create a near-degenerate triangle (collinear if only node_1,2,3), so at least one new node is needed off the x-axis to form a truss that can take a vertical/horizontal load. With load -10 at -45° (~(-7.07, -7.07)), and supports at ends, optimal member layout: a triangle including node_3 and an off-axis node above node_3 to create triangulation, linking all main nodes, forming minimal three or four member truss. Key risk: proper triangles required for stable structure and connectivity.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Recognize optimal location for additional node is above node_3, i.e., pick node_4 (2.9,1.6); creates two triangles. Pin at node_1, roller at node_2, with loads transferring through triangular path. Internal angles kept reasonable by placing node_4 near centroid to distribute loads and support equilibrium. Select member areas based on anticipated forces - likely member_1 (node_1-node_3), member_2 (node_3-node_2), member_3 (node_1-node_4), member_4 (node_2-node_4), member_5 (node_3-node_4).",\n\n    "reasoning": "Adding single new node above and between supports allows load to transfer to both supports more efficiently, forming a minimal statically determinate structure (externally rigid). Triangulation ensures load paths and minimizes out-of-plane force magnification, avoiding collinearity. Optimizing area_ids: large members for slanting struts that take large compressive/tensile forces, lighter for shorter members along least-critical paths.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Suppose the triangle: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (2.9,1.6). Members: (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), (node_2-node_4), (node_1-node_4), (node_3-node_4). For -10√2/2 vertical and horizontal loads (i.e., -7.07x, -7.07y), most load passes through struts to both supports - longest diagonal has highest force. Use area_id \'3\' (1.759) for slanting (critical) members, linkages to node_4 use \'1\' (0.195). Calculate each member length with distance formula and sum mass as length × area. Estimate each member\'s force: for slant between node_3 and node_4 takes high out-of-plane force. Confirm selections give stress ≤ 15 in all members under worst-case resolved component of load.",\n\n    "calculation": "Main lengths: node_1-node_3=2.00, node_3-node_2=4.00, node_1-node_4≈3.34, node_2-node_4≈3.31, node_3-node_4≈1.83. Assign: (node_1-node_3)=area_id \'3\', (node_3-node_2)=area_id \'3\', (node_1-node_4)=area_id \'1\', (node_2-node_4)=area_id \'1\', (node_3-node_4)=area_id \'4\' (3.128). Estimate axial loads proportionally (new node helps share forces: principal loaded elements are 1-3, 3-2, 3-4). Max axial force ~8 (|vertical + horizontal| from the load for worst case), thus area for high force members ≥ 8/15=0.534. Chosen \'1.759\' more than sufficient, even for unexpected edge cases. Mass=sum(length*area): 2.0*1.759+4.0*1.759+3.34*0.195+3.31*0.195+1.83*3.128=3.52+7.04+0.65+0.65+5.72=17.58<30.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Verified triangle structure, all nodes joined (closed structure), statically stable.
