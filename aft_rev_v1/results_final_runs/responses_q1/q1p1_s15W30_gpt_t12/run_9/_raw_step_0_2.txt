The truss must minimize maximum member stress (≤15 in tension/compression), remain fully connected, and not exceed a total structural mass of 30 units. Only specified cross-sectional area values are allowed. All nodes, members, and sizing are determined within these constraints.",\n   \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given only three nodes, the minimum closed, triangulated form is a triangle. The supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) force the truss to efficiently transmit loads along direct paths, while supporting the -10 kN load at node_3 at a 45° downward/sideward angle. Mass and stress limits favor the absolute minimum triangle plus precise sizing.",\n   \n    "analysis": "The structure must use the triangle (3 bar) shape for closure, since only 3 nodes are specified and all must be directly connected for a closed structure. Because of node placements (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), we have a slender triangle with a base of 6.0 units and height of 0—meaning all three nodes are on x axis. This is colinear, and in reality doesn\'t give a triangle. This is problematic: a closed truss normally cannot form unless points are non-collinear. Here, proper implementation compels using only these nodes (per instruction), possibly adding ONE additional node above or below to allow triangulation and permit the structure to support vertical shear by triangulation. Adding a single node above diagonal is justified so the structure is not singular.",\n   \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Colinearity of existing nodes will make ANY truss without at least one new node incapable of resisting vertical loads; axial-only loads can\'t generate a vertical reaction. Therefore, the only way to create a valid truss is to introduce one auxiliary node. Placing it at (2, 1.5) above the line ensures effective triangulation and enables load transfer. All three given nodes are connected to this upper node, forming a stable triangle, and chords (straight-line elements) complete closure.",\n   \n    "reasoning": "Introduce a single strategically-placed node, node_4 at (2.00, 1.50), above the node_3. This optimizes: 1) triangulation (to prevent collapse from colinearity); 2) direct vertical force support (allowing vertical load from node_3 to efficiently produce compressive/tension forces in angled elements and reducing stress in base chord); 3) symmetry around the central node_3. We\'ll connect all nodes in a single loop (node_1-node_4-node_2-node_3-node_1), including diagonals (node_4 to node_3) to achieve statical determinacy, stability, and ample redundancy for the specified load. We\'ll select the smallest areas without violating max stress or mass constraints by sizing the highly loaded members appropriately.",\n   \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume: all members pin-ended and made from same material (units arbitrary, focus on area-to-stress/mass mapping). The typical member force (F) = load fraction × geometry multiplier; stress = F / area; mass per member = length × area. Apply equilibrium to solve for member forces under 10 kN load applied -45° at node_3, with reactions at nodes 1 & 2. Try assigning min feasible areas, check stress per constraint. Start: estimate highest member force, assign cross-section with area ≥ (|Fmax|/15), then try next-smaller area and verify. Tweak as needed to keep mass <30 while stress ≤15 everywhere.",\n   \n    "calculation": "Member fast checks (see scratch): \\nNodes: node_3=(2.0,0.0); node_4=(2.0,1.5).
