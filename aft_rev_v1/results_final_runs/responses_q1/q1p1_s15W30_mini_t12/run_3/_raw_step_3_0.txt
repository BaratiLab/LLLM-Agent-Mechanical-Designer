Our objective is to generate a closed 2D truss with nodal supports and loading fully respected, eliminating constraint violations by lowering max stress below ±15 while keeping total mass ≤ 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The problem involves 4 nodes with pinned/roller supports at nodes 1 and 2. A single diagonal downward force (-10 at 45°) is applied at node 3. Current structure lacks a ground member between supports and has uneven area assignments with a max compressive stress -17.81. Historic structures show improvements with addition of bottom chords and more triangulation but increase mass above target.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current structure lacks a closed rectangular or trapezoidal framework with a rigid base (between node_1 and node_2). Load is applied at node_3, which lies between supports but induces high compression in member_1. The top node (node_4) offsets from vertical centerline but insufficient strut triangulation leads to high bending forces converting to high axial stresses. Historic #1 has a base member joining support nodes reducing bending, but mass is higher (34.0543). The current approach reduces mass but severely violates stress constraints. Member area assignments are not optimized for effective load transfer. The final design must have a base member and appropriate diagonals to divert loads via triangulation and lower maximal axial stress.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key observations: base chord is absent in current designs resulting in large bending and direct compressive loads beyond limits. Combining base chord, front/back diagonals and keeping node_3 stabilized would reduce compression. Adjusting node_4 height upwards provides effective triangulation and distributes tension/compression. Area sizing closer to mid values (areas 2-4) stabilize stress while limiting mass. The roller support at node_2 must only transfer vertical reaction. All nodes are utilized and connected, preserving closed nature of structure.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Adopt the rectangular trapezoidal layout from \'constraint_not_met_1\' with refinements: keep nodes 1 and 2 at y=0 connected by a base member, lift node 4 to ~3.5 for efficient force transfer, maintain node 3 between them at y=0 (fixed), add diagonal crossover members \'node_3-node_4\' and \'node_1-node_2\'. After ensuring all nodes connect, assign areas to members prioritizing diagonals and compressive members with medium-large areas to lower peak stresses. Remove unused or redundant members that increase mass without improving stresses. Finalize a 6-member closed truss with supported optimized areas.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Structural principles guide: triangulation ensures no zero-force members, minimizes bending by converting moments into axial forces. Symmetry alleviates unbalanced stresses. Loaded node 3 horizontal location subordinated to supports. Base chord improves base stiffness and half span compression. Diagonals absorb shear like a Warren truss, load per length divides well. Member length calculated by node coord distance; mass computed by length×area density, adjustable by cross-section. Areas from predefined set balance strength vs mass. Change node_4 height to adjust member lengths and reduce stress; do not alter nodes 1-3 for constraints about loads/support fixation. Allow diagonal tendons on top from node_1 to node_4 and node_2 to node_4, plus diagonal crossover node_3 to node_4 and node_1 to node_2 base. This forms closed stable triangulated frame with acceptable mass and stress.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths L=√(Δx² + Δy²). Mass = Σ (L_i * area_i). Max stress target ≤15. Check compression by force equilibrium ΣF_x=0 and ΣF_y=0 at nodes 3/4. Area choices guide stress σ=F/A and cross-sectional area scaled per member to keep stress compliant. Roller support at node_2 allows horizontal displacement but restrains vertical loads. Use trigonometry on members meeting at node_3 with applied force (magnitude=10, direction= -45° equiv -7.07 x and -7.07 y approx).
