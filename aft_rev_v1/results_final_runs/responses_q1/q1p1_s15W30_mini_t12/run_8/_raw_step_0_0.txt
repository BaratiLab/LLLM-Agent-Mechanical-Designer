Objective is to minimize stress (within ±15) while total mass ≤ 30, ensuring full connectivity and closure.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes are node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0) with a diagonal downward load (-10 at -45°) at node_3. Supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller) imply boundary conditions restraining vertical and horizontal motion at 1 and vertical only at 2. The structure must be closed (minimum 3 members forming closed loop). Constraints on stress ≤ ±15 and total mass ≤30 must hold.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The load at node_3 acts downward-left at 45°, generating tension and compression in members connected to node_3. A single straight beam from node_1 to node_2 is not closed. To produce a closed truss, need to include members creating a triangle or polygon including node_3. The minimal closed truss is the triangle formed by nodes (1, 2, 3). This would be members 1-2, 2-3, 3-1.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangle is optimally stable with only three members. Given node_3 is on the x-axis and load acts downward-left, expect tensile force in member 3-1 and compressive force in member 3-2 to stabilize the load under supports at nodes 1 and 2.
