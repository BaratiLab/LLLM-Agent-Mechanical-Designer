The objective is to generate a statically stable closed 2D truss with redistributed forces and reduced max stress ≤15, and total mass ≤30, satisfying given supports and loaded nodes.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given load (-10, -45°) at node_3, pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2, and existing nodes and members, current design suffers stress concentration primarily on member_2. Historical structures either exceeded stress limits or resulted in more mass. A closed truss is required to ensure load path continuity and better triangulation for stress distribution.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load at node_3, pushing diagonally downward-left, imparts tension/compression force chains through members connecting it to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5. Current member_2 joining node_2 to node_4 has highest tensile stress (15.66), close to limit but still violated. Members closer to supports carry less stress and show compression. Existing geometry has 5 nodes with poor triangulation and asymmetric load path, concentrating stress heavily in the critical member easing out from node_3 upward to node_4 and across to node_2. Structure generation history shows better stress distribution in a redesigned node 5 position (rank_1 with stress max around 6.31) but it involved higher mass (24+) which while safe is above historical stable iterations mass of ~18 and exceeds improvement goal. High stress is usually because of insufficient triangulation or longer unsupported members (like member_2).",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns from history and analysis show that symmetrical and more triangulated designs reduce peak stresses. Node_5 position elevation helps stress dispersion but needs optimization to reduce mass. Member cross sections need fine sizing to prevent over-sizing (too high mass) or under-sizing (failure by stress). Constraint driver is primarily max stress staying within ±15 while carrying load. Closed truss with more diagonals can better spread load than trapezoidal sparse shapes. The supports and loads fixivity requires members to form triangles, especially linking node_3 to supports with alternative load redistribution routes.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Propose redesign with 5 nodes forming a closed truss: base nodes fixed (node_1 at (0,0) pinned, node_2 at (6,0) roller, both immutable), node_3 at (2,0) with load fixed, rearranging node_4 and node_5 upwards for more stable triangulation: Place node_4 around (3,1.4) and node_5 around (4,0.6). Add diagonal cross members forming triangles: node_3–4, 4–5, 5–2, 5–3, 4–2, 1–4, 1–3. Area ids will be matched for load capacity - larger areas on high-load tensile paths, smaller where forces are low to optimize mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Load distributes mainly from node_3 downward-left to node_1 pinned and roller at node_2 right side. The triangular substructures 1-4-3 and 3-4-5-2 create multiple paths for load share, reducing compression/tensile spikes. Maintaining node_3 load and supports limits movement of key nodes but freeing node_4 and node_5 to allow better height ratio (around 0.5-0.7 of base length) improves vertical load support and reduces member length extremes, decreasing member force magnitude, and increasing stability. Area sizing prioritizes members from supports to loaded nodes for strength. Triangle sides are roughly balanced to promote better stress distribution. Single diagonal to node_5 further connects labyrinth improving redundancy; removing direct direct member_6 (node_1–node_3) to force clearer primary load path helps reduce over-stressing member_2 formerly challenged in history.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic members under axial load only, uniform member material and E, forces proportional to lengths and cross sections. Force equilibrium in 2D sum Fx=0, Fy=0 and moment constraints applied. Mass = sum of member length × assigned cross-sectional area. Stress = Force / Area_exact (area discrete per area_id). Estimate member forces by vector resolving loads through small triangles using static equilibrium and calculating lengths using distance formula. Largest stress identified and then select area_id for adequate safety = max force / area ≤ allowable stress (15), verify total mass ≤ 30 kg. Equations: Member length = sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2), Mass = Sum(length × area from area_id, mapping to cross-section area). Calculate stresses accordingly and adjust areas to respect constraints.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Calculated node coordinates: node_4 (3.00, 1.40), node_5 (4.00, 0.60). Member lengths (m): 1-4=1.40, 4-2=3.21, 3-4=1.48, 3-5=2.00, 5-2=2.20, 1-3=2.00, 4-5=0.9. Assign areas per member balancing-member_stress: member_2 (4-2) largest load get area_id \'6\' (~7.037); others smaller: e.g., member_1 \'3\' (1.759), member_3 \'4\' (3.128), member_4 \'3\' (1.759), member_5 \'3\' (1.759), member_6 \'3\' (1.759), member_7 \'2\'(0.782) for 4-5.

Supports and loaded nodes unchanged.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_final": "Final structure respects node constraints (no changes in loaded and supported nodes), provides closed triangulation, areas scaled for compliance.
