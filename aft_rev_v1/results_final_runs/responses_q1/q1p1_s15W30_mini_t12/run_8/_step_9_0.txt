    "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under single angled load, minimizing max stress with given supports and nodes, ensuring closed structure, staying within max ±15 stress and total mass ≤30.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Problem: Load (-10N at node_3 at -45°), supports on node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Objective: reduce max absolute stress 5.55, total mass 27.85 with current 5-node, 6-member closed truss. Cross-sections from prescribed area_id.",
    
    "analysis": "Current design has good triangulation and support conditions; load mainly resisted by members connected to node_3 and upper nodes 4, 5. Highest compressive stress occurs in member_6 (node_1–node_3) with -5.55, low tensile stresses in others max ~4.74. Mass at 27.85 is below limit 30. Also history shows alternative designs with lower mass but higher stresses and/or constraint violations. Members 4 and 5 carry zero stress indicating potential for cross-sectional optimization or removal, but removing risks structure closure. Node_4 and node_5 positions (3.0,2.2) and (4.1,1.25) align load paths well.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "Members with zero stress or very low stress area could have reduced cross-section. Adjusting node_4 and node_5 vertically lower might better distribute stresses and lower max stress and mass. Member_6 stress is highest, likely critical load path. Holding fixed nodes imposed by loads/supports prevents repositioning node_3, node_1, node_2. Triangulation intact. Cross-section reduction on low-stress members could save mass without increasing stress beyond constraints.",
    
    "proposal": "Modify cross-sectional areas to reduce area for members 4 and 5 from 2 (0.782) to 1 (0.195), holding others constant for adequate strength. Slightly adjust node_5 vertically down (~0.05m) to reduce stress peak with minimal repositioning. Maintain closed topology. This aims at lowering mass and max stress further under constraints.",
    
    "reasoning": "Reduce member_4 and member_5 cross-section efficiently reduces mass with no added stress since current stress=0 for those members. Lower node_5 y from 1.25 to 1.20 reduces lever arm for member_6 reducing its stress. All other node positions fixed except node_4 and node_5 allowed small adjustments. Improved load path and load redistribution reduce peak stress.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linearly elastic behavior, uniform cross-section for members. Mass = length × area_id factor. Stress scales inversely with area. Load vector (-10N, -45°) decomposed X and Y components, summed in joint equilibrium, solve with truss mechanics. Calculate length of members using distance formula. Expected stress reduction in member_6 due to shorter lever arm from node_5 lowering. Area_id choices influence stiffness and mass.",
    
    "calculation": "Calculated member lengths: member_4 (node_3-node_5) reduced length slightly due to lowered node_5. Decreasing area_id 2 → 1 on members 4 & 5 reduces mass approx. 1.511 (65% reduction). Peak compressive stress in member_6 recalculated assuming node_5 vertical shift decreases bending moment effect, stress expected to reduce from 5.55 to ~5.1. Total mass estimated at ~26.35 <30. Verified stresses on reduced area members still below limit due to zero starting stress.",
    "scratch_pad_final": "All nodes fixed except node_4 and node_5 y adjusted minimally: y_node_5 =1.20 (from 1.25), node_4 fixed at (3.00,2.20) to preserve triangulation load path. Members 4 & 5 area set to '1' (0.195). Others retain '3' or '4' matching original except 4 & 5 minimal area. Stress max abs under constraint ±15, fewer mass confirmed below limit 30. Closed structure preserved with all members connected properly per node sets.",
