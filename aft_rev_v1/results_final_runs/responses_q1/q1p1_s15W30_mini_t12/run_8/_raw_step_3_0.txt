Optimization goal is to redesign a statically efficient closed truss with minimized max stress and mass within limits.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Initial design has over-stressed member_4 and unbalanced forces in diagonal members. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) create boundary conditions with node_3 loaded. The max tensile/compressive stress limit ±15 is violated notably on member_4. Generations in history show smaller max stresses (~24 and 85) but still exceed constraints or have unnecessary complexity or mass.",\n    "analysis": "Current load at node_3 applies a downward-left force of 10N at -45 degrees, effectively both vertical and horizontal. The main failed member_4 connects loaded node_3 to node_5, carrying excessive stress. Node_5 and node_4 positions raise vertical complexity but insufficient triangulation. The structure lacks symmetric triangulation from supports to load for effective force transfer and stress dispersion. History members reflect attempts to alter topology and node placement, but none balanced mass and stress optimally. Closed triangulated shapes with direct load paths and stronger supports near load needed to minimize member stress.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "A successful design likely requires a staple-like triangulated structure connecting pinned node_1 and roller node_2 over load node_3, reinforced by internal diagonal members to reduce bending and high tensile/compressive stresses. Use robust lower area sections for members near high tension/compression, and minimal-area slender members where compressive forces are lower.",\n    "proposal": "Redesign structure with 4 nodes: supports node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), load node_3 (2,0), plus a newly placed apex node_4 at (3.00, 2.00) above the load line to form a symmetrical isosceles triangle. Add node_5 near node_3 horizontally at (4.00, 1.00) for further triangulation and closed topology. Connect members forming closed triangulated mesh: 1-4, 2-4, 3-4, 3-5, 2-5, and 1-3 for load transfer. Incorporate diagonal members and select area sizes optimally from given set to satisfy max stress ±15 and total mass ≤ 30.",\n    "reasoning": "Using a symmetrical isosceles triangle with apex node_4 directly above load node_3 provides direct load transfer to pin and roller supports with balanced force vectors. Including node_5 creates a second triangulated zone stabilizing side forces, reducing bending moments and net stress concentration. Triangle and redundant diagonal cross members increase stiffness and reduce peak stress from the oblique loading at -45 deg. Areas should be larger on the main chords and smaller where forces are minor. Load node and supports fixed in position per instructions. This design is statically indeterminate but well triangulated, bounding stresses and mass reasonably.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: members behave linear elastic; stress proportional to axial force / area; forces calculated using joint equilibrium.
