The goal is to generate a feasible closed 2D truss structure with supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller), a force at node_3, adhering to max stress ±15 and mass ≤30 constraints while minimizing stresses and mass.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Current design has five nodes and eight members including top chords, diagonals and a base chord. Max stress reached due to tension in member_5. Stress is not balanced; some members have excess stress creating inefficiency. History suggests denser triangulation and slightly adjusted top nodes reduce max stress. Favorable area sizes around 1 to 3 for most members that can carry load and reduce mass.",\n\n  "analysis": "Loads: single downward-left force at node_3 requires good shear and moment resistance. Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 provide fixed and horizontal support. The current arrangement has 5 nodes with a rectangular-trapezoidal pattern. Highly stressed member in history is the diagonal from node_1 to node_4 (member_5) due to load transfer, which acts like a main load path, causing high tensile stress. Some direct horizontal chords at base and top offer stability. Less stressed diagonals connected with node_4 and node_5 indicate load redistribution could be improved via node positioning and member sizing. Historical structures with similar topology but larger cross-sectional areas and small tweaks in node_4 and node_5 reduce max stress below 8 and total mass slightly under the limit around 23–30, suggesting better triangulation and balanced stiffness around the apex nodes improves load distribution and mass efficiency.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Two key observations: (1) Dense triangulation around load node and apex nodes significantly diminishes peak stresses and balances load paths; (2) The sizing of diagonal members transferring load to supports must be optimized to avoid overstress. A balance with moderate area sizes (around 2 to 3) effectively controls stress, and restructuring top nodes slightly farther apart stabilizes load transfer. Alternative diagonals like added member from cusp (node_5) to fixed node_1 creates advantageous load paths but must not increase mass excessively.",\n\n  "proposal": "Use a 5-node closed polygon truss similar to best historic (rank_1) with node_4 at (2.35, 3.20), node_5 at (4.65, 3.20) and members densely triangulated with moderate cross-sectional areas. Area sizes selected from provided keys to satisfy stress ≤ ±15 and mass ≤ 30 constraints. Maintain supports and load node positions fixed.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Symmetrical linguistic arrangement for top nodes reduces eccentricity; triangulated members provide load path stability with efficient transfer of load from node_3 through diagonals to supports. Shorter member lengths near apex nodes allow smaller area for same strength, limiting mass growth. Selection of diagonal member sizes uses history insight favoring area_id \'2\' or \'3\' for diagonals connected to load node and area \'1\' or \'2\' for horizontal chords at base/top to limit mass growth. Supports pinned and roller separate horizontal and vertical restraint aiding statics.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Static equilibrium solved for vertical and horizontal forces considering member axial force only. Formula: Member Force ≈ External Force × Trig Function (inclination). Stresses follow F = Stress × Area. Mass estimated as sum(length × area). Member lengths calculated by Euclidean distance formula. Choose member area from nearest fit and verified to yield stress within constraints and total mass ≤ 30.",\n\n  "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3: 2.0, node_3-node_4: approx 3.25, node_4-node_5: 2.3, node_5-node_2: 1.5, node_1-node_4: approx 3.5, node_4-node_2: approx 3.9, node_3-node_5: approx 3.2, node_1-node_2: 6.0. Selected areas for main diagonals each chosen 1.759 or 2.0 equivalent area_id 3 or 2 reducing stress to ~7 max seen in rank_1 historical structure. Horizontal members use lower area_id 1 or 2. Total mass estimated was around 25–29 per history which meets constraint. Max stress stands at approx ±7.48 verifying constraint compliance.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Final design has nodes and members mimicking rank_1 best design, all constraints satisfy: max |stress| ≤ 15, total mass ≤ 30.
