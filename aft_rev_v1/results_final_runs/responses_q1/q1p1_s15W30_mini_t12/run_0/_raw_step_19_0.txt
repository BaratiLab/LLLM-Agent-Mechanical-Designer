Members mostly with area_id=\'3\' for heavily stressed members. Max compressive/tensile stress is 7.48, well under ±15 limit. Mass is 29.6177, just under 30 but can be slightly reduced. Load at node_3 induces compression in major bottom chords (members 1 and 8) and tension in vertical/diagonal chords. Triangulation provides stable paths. Generation history shows no designs with significantly lower stress but similar or lower mass. Some members have low stress and large cross section (area_id=\'3\'), suggesting room to reduce area there to save mass while still respecting stress constraint. Nodes with supports and loads are fixed in position to maintain boundary condition integrity. Slight repositioning at free nodes is questionable but minimal and will be avoided to maintain current stable configuration.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Since max stress < 15, no violation occurs. Slack in area usage can target members under lower stress (members 4 and 6 have very low stresses, ~1.4 and 0.25). Reducing their cross-sectional area can cut mass without increasing stress beyond limits. Ensuring all nodes connected with closed geometry maintained. Slight area downgrades on low-stress members avoid introducing instability. Positions are held fixed for load and supports nodes. Keep member 5 (max stress ~7.48) at current large cross section for safety. Whole structure is symmetric vertically; keeping that avoids stress concentration or instability.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Refine cross-sectional areas for low-stressed members: reduce members with stress <2 (member_4 and member_6) area from \'3\' or \'1\' to smaller area from area_id list (e.g., \'1\' = 0.195 or \'2\' = 0.782). Keep high-stress members (mostly members 1,2,5,7 at area_id \'3\') unchanged. Node positions remain fixed due to supports and loads. No additional members proposed due to complexity and closed loop maintenance.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "The largest mass contributions occur with area_id 3 members. Member 6 has low actual axial stress (~0.2494) but is sized \'1\' area—could be reduced to 0.195 (area_id \'1\'). Member 4 stress is 1.4346, with current area \'3\' (1.759), smaller area like \'2\' (0.782) might suffice and significantly cut mass. Other members with moderate stress will retain current sizing. This incremental cross-section tuning respects principle to reduce mass while avoiding exceeding stress limits. Triangulation and closed geometry preserved to maintain load paths. Node repositioning avoided due to fixed loads/supports at their positions.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculated from node coordinates.
