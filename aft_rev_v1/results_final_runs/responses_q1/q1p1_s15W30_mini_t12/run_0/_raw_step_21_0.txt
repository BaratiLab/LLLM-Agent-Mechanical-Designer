Objective is to generate a closed 2D truss structure satisfying max stress ≤ ±15 and total mass ≤ 30 by refining node locations and member sizing.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Structure has 5 nodes: 2 supports at nodes 1(pinned) and 2(roller) at [0,0] and [6,0]. A vertical load of 10 N at -45° is applied at node_3(2,0). Current members connect these nodes forming two adjacent triangles with members covered by area_ids 1,2,3. Max stress hotspots are on members near node_1 to node_3 and node_3 to node_4.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 downward-left induces significant compressive force in member_1(node1-node3), observed peak negative stress -5.35. Members near node_4 have moderate stress distributing load to roller support node_2. Despite low max stress, total mass is 34.59, exceeding 30. RMS suggests some members oversized (area_id \'3\') yielding higher mass than needed. History shows designs with node_4 and node_5 roughly at y~3.2 reduce mass but increase stress beyond limits (~7-11) or violate max stress. Non-triangulated earlier designs show problematic large tensile/compressive forces creating high stresses. Current design is statically stable but could be optimized by reducing member areas and repositioning nodes 4 and 5 slightly lower to reduce total member lengths.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Stress distribution favors triangulated members from supports up to loaded node_3. Areas can be reduced from \'3\' to \'2\' or \'1\' in low-stress members to reduce mass. Node y-coordinates near 3.2 are historically linked to lower mass but potentially elevated stress. Slightly reducing heights of upper nodes (4,5) can reduce member lengths and thus total mass while retaining load paths. Area 3 usage should be limited to highest stress members. Closed truss is best maintained by continuous triangulation between nodes_1, 3, 4, 5, and 2.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Adopt the best historical triangulated structure near node_4 node_5 height ~3.2, slightly reduce y from 3.35 to 3.2 for nodes 4 and 5 to reduce mass. Reduce member areas selectively: set member_5 (n1-n4) and member_7 (n3-n5) from \'3\' to \'2\'. Use \'1\' area_id for low-stress transfer members to roller node_2. Keep nodes 1-2-3 fixed as required by loads/supports. This approach targets mass reduction under 30 while keeping max stress below ±15 due to smaller areas on low-stress members and slight geometrical optimization.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation from node_1 to node_3 to node_4 to node_5 to node_2 distributes loads efficiently by transferring loads through multiple paths minimizing peak stresses. By lowering node 4 and 5 y-coordinates we shorten members, especially longer top chords, reducing total mass. Smaller cross-sectional areas are allocated to members with stresses less than 5 units. The pinned support at node_1 transfers reactions; roller at node_2 handles horizontal displacement. Maintaining these boundary conditions allows stable static equilibrium without large bending. Members connected between loaded node_3 and top nodes are retained with moderate cross-section to resist compressive force from load at -45 deg applied on node_3.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume: Member length = Euclidean distance between nodes (x,y).
