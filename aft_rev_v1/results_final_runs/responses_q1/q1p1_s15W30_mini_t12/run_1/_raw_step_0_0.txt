The goal is minimizing maximum member stress, ensuring the truss is closed, all nodes connected, and total mass <= 30 with max stress ±15.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes (0,0), (6,0), (2,0) are colinear. The load at node_3 downward-left forces bending/tension issues if members connect only along x-axis. Pinned and roller supports fix horizontal and vertical displacements suitably. Only three nodes don\'t form a closed shape, so at least one new node is needed off the baseline to enable triangulation and reduction of member stresses. Member cross-sections must be selected amongst given discrete area choices for mass and stress efficiency.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Node_3 carries a -10 magnitude load at -45°, decomposes to -7.071 N both horizontally and vertically. With node_1 pinned and node_2 roller, reaction forces key to equilibrium. Original nodes are colinear, no triangulation, risk high axial stress in edge members. A closed truss requires at least forming one triangle, ideally adding a fourth node above baseline near x=2-4 meters for effective load path to supports. Members forming triangle will enable better force distribution. Member length and recommended section areas must balance between reducing stress and mass limits.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulating by adding node above baseline can redirect forces efficiently. Symmetry can improve simplicity, but since node_3 is off-center, small asymmetry acceptable. No members connecting node_1 to node_2 directly; we add nodes and members creating triangular loops connecting the three original nodes tightly, avoiding nip and stress concentration at node_3.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Add node_4 at mid-x, ~ y=3.5 (away from baseline) to create two triangle loops: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_4-node_3-node_2. Use members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_1, node_4-node_2, node_2-node_3, forming a closed polygon. Choose member areas strategically: smaller cross section where stresses low - edges; larger on lines under direct load (node_3 connections). Validate with force equilibrium in x and y at nodes and max mass constraint. Use area_id 3 (1.759), 2 (0.782), 1 (0.195) to balance mass and stress.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumption: Linear elastic, axial forces dominate. Calculate forces in members by static equilibrium and method of joints. Use geometry for member length. Compute axial stress = force / area. Check max stress ≤ ±15. Calculate total mass = sum(length_i × area_i). Adjust cross-sectional area to bring stress under constraints without surpassing mass limit of 30. Iterations simplified here as single-shot estimate.
