The goal is to design a closed 2D truss with stable support and applied load, satisfying max stress ±15 and total mass ≤30. Support nodes and loaded node fixed in position.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "We have a 5-node truss with supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller), a load at node_3 down-left. Current design has slightly asymmetric upper nodes causing uneven stress and mass over limit. Cross sectional areas vary; more uniform area distribution may help control mass and stress.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Constraints violated primarily due to excess total mass causing oversized members to control stress. Members connecting top nodes to supports and diagonals carry sizeable stress but some higher area members cause mass penalty. Load introduces compression on members from node_3 towards node_1 and tension towards node_2 and upper nodes. Current geometry with node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) and node_5 at (4.1, 2.75) creates elongated diagonals and inefficient load transfer. Prior structures with more symmetrical position of top nodes (e.g., node_6 at around (2.0,4.0)) have slightly lower stress but higher mass. Designs with fewer members caused excessive stress violations. Effective truss should triangulate load path evenly, minimize member lengths, and assign sectional areas conservatively but efficiently per member forces.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Symmetry in vertical plane about the midline between node_1 and node_2 is beneficial to balance loads between pinned and roller supports. Top nodes around height 3.5–4.0 and horizontal spacing between 2.0–4.0 seem to distribute forces evenly. Closed truss with sufficient triangulation to avoid stress concentration on single members is key. Area/Pier cross-section assignment should use mid-range values, predominantly area_id \'2\'=0.782 or \'3\'=1.759, minimizing heavier areas to critical tension/compression members only.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Propose a redesign with 5 nodes. Keep node_1 and node_2 supports fixed at (0.0, 0.0) and (6.0, 0.0). Keep load node_3 fixed at (2.0, 0.0). Introduce two top nodes at (2.1, 3.6) and (3.8, 3.6) to symmetrically triangulate load transfer to supports. Connect all nodes to form a fully closed/triangulated structure with members along supports, across base, bottom node to each upper node, and diagonals between top nodes and base nodes. Assign cross-sectional areas evaluating force directions to minimize mass and maintain stress < 15.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "The chosen upper node elevations (3.6m) balance structural efficiency and reduce member lengths vs prior configurations at 3.0 or 4.0. Horizontal positions near 2.1 and 3.8 provide near midpoints between supports and load node, excellent for symmetric load-sharing. Triangulation fully closes the load path and distributes stresses evenly, lowering peak stress on any member. Using cross sections ranging mostly from area_id \'2\' (0.782) to \'3\' (1.759) controls mass while keeping strength. Key vertical and diagonal members handling compressive load from pin to load get slightly larger areas, others smaller. This keeps total mass < 30 and max stress < 15 concurrently.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assume linear axial truss members under static loads equilibrium. Use basic static force equilibrium equations: sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, sum moments=0 at nodes, solve for member axial forces and hence stresses (force / cross-section). Calculate length = sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2). Mass sum = Σ length × density_effective = Σ length × area (assuming unit density). Verify max |stress| ≤ 15 and total mass ≤ 30.
