  "preamble": "Initial design has a triangular truss under vertical/diagonal load with stress exceeding limits (max 55.6 > 15) and total mass below limit. The objective is a feasible closed truss with max |stress| ≤15 and total mass ≤30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given: 4 nodes with one at load (-10 N @ -45°) and two supports (pinned and roller). Current truss is 2D, has triangle formed with one top node (node_4) and bottom nodes along x-axis. Stress mostly high in short horizontal members near load node (member_1), likely due to insufficient triangulation or member sizing.",
  "analysis": "Current structure connects nodes: bottom nodes are co-linear (node_1, node_3, node_2). Load applied at node_3 creates high stress in horizontal members (member_1 and member_2). Top node (node_4) at 2.0, 2.5 with diagonal members to supports reduces vertical displacement but member_1 exceeds stress limits. History shows no better structures available. Mass low but stress too high due to poor load path redeployment. Critical to improve load transfer by introducing better triangulation and distributing load via more members or repositioned nodes. The fixed load at node_3 restricts modifications there but node positions for supports and top node can be optimized. Triangular meshes work better for closed 2D trusses for stability. Adding one or two more nodes above load node may help redistribute forces. Also increasing member areas where needed with minimal mass increase is needed.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "The main issue is high compressive stress in short horizontal members at load node due to direct diagonal load. Load path must be redirected through a stiffer upper arch or multiple diagonals. Design should maintain pin at node_1 (0,0) and roller at node_2 (6,0). Involving nodes above load node_3 with symmetrically placed vertical/horizontal members (diamond shaped or nodal grid) can reduce stress. Member areas need to be chosen carefully to keep max stress ≤15 and mass ≤30.",
  "proposal": "Redesign: Keep nodes_1 and 2 fixed due to supports. Keep node_3 load fixed. Add node_5 at (4.13, 2.58) to the right above load. Add node_6 at (2.00, 4.00) as top apex node above center node_3 to form dual triangles. Members will form a symmetrical closed polygon with triangulated diagonals from supports to top apex providing multiple load paths, ensuring lower peak stress while maintaining mass constraints.",
  "reasoning": "Introducing two new nodes above load node creates 4 triangles: (node_1,node_3,node_6), (node_2,node_3,node_5), (node_6,node_3,node_5), and others across bottom base ensuring continuous interconnected support, optimized force flow reduces peak stress in members. Node_6 coordinates at approx. midpoint x=2.00 with higher y (4.00) split vertical compression to multiple members. Node_5 chosen above node_2 to help form triangular geometry. Utilizing proper diagonals creates multifaceted load distribution minimizing tension/compression peaks. Set areas moderate (~1.759 or ~0.782) near load, larger areas where needed further away for mass savings.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear axial stress only. Linear elastic small deformation.
