Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller), with a load at node_3, targeting efficient load path and minimal structural weight.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes: node_1(0.0,0.0), node_2(6.0,0.0), node_3(2.0,0.0). Load at node_3 of -10N at -45°. Supports fix displacements at node_1 fully and node_2 vertically. Three nodes are collinear (on x-axis). To form closed truss and ensure load transfer, need non-collinear node(s). Minimum triangulation requires one additional node above line to form stable triangular closed shape.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load is a downward-left diagonal load at node_3. Without vertical member or polygon above line, structure beyond collinear will be unstable under lateral loading. The pinned node_1 fully restrains, roller node_2 only vertically. Direct member connections: node_1 to node_2, node_1 to node_3, node_3 to node_2 are collinear. Adding node_4 elevated at approximately midspan near node_3 & node_2 will form triangulated members. Members: [node_1-node_3], [node_3-node_2], [node_1-node_4], [node_3-node_4], [node_4-node_2], forming closed polygon. Efficient load path through triangulated multi-member nodes will reduce stress.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation is key to stability. New node will convert structure into a stable 4-node polygon (quadrilateral). Node_4 placed above x-axis near load to provide compression/tension paths for given load. Using available cross-section areas, moderate to smaller areas for shorter tension members and larger area for high-compression longer members optimizes stress and mass. Avoid very large or small cross sections at first to reevaluate stress. Estimate mass from length×area given.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Placing node_4 approx at (3.0,2.5) forms triangle with node_1 and node_3 and node_2, reducing bending and buckling. Load paths will be distributed across members sharing the load, lowering axial stress. Select area_id=\'3\'(1.759) for longer members and \'1\'(0.195) or \'2\'(0.782) for shorter members to keep mass low. Enumerate members: (node_1-node_3), (node_2-node_3), (node_1-node_4), (node_3-node_4), (node_2-node_4), summing mass and verifying stress.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths using distance formula.

Member length lengths~distance calculations: node_1-node_3=2m, node_3-node_2=4m, node_1-node_4~ (3²+2.5²)^0.5≈3.905m, node_3-node_4~(1²+2.5²)^0.5=2.692m, node_2-node_4~(3²+2.5²)^0.5=3.905m.

Estimated load at node_3 is (-10 N, -45°), decomposed Fx=-7.07 N, Fy=-7.07 N. Use resolution at node_3 for axial forces considering member direction cosines.
