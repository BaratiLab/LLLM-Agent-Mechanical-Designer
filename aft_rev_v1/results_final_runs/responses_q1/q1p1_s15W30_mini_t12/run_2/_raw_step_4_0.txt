The goal is to reduce max stress closer to the ±15 limit and lower mass marginally, maintaining closed truss integrity and compliance with supports and loads.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Input load at node_3 (-10 N, -45°), supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Nodes fixed at 1 and 2. Current structure with 5 nodes and 8 members shows uneven stress, particularly member_6 at ~14.94. Area choices span 0.195 to 19.548. Current design is near threshold for mass and stress. Proceed with stress distribution improvements by node reposition near nodes 4 and 5, and member area reassignment aiming for fewer large areas to reduce mass.",\n\n    "analysis": "The load on node_3 is significant and combined with fixed supports at nodes_1 and 2 forms a stable base. The major stress concentration is on member_6 (connecting nodes 4 and 5), currently with the smallest area (id \'1\'= 0.195) but stressed to near limit 14.94. This suggests the load path concentrates force through this slender member. The direct member between nodes_4 and _5 is shortest at about 1.41 length, but stress is high likely due to area choice. Member_8 connecting node_3 to node_5 is large in mass with moderate stress. The two historic top-ranked designs differ mainly in node positions and member sizing; best design shown with nodes_4 at (2.9, 3.0) and node_5 at (4.1, 3.0) showed lowered max stress at 14.66 and almost 5% lower mass at 27.6. The current node_4 at (2.7, 2.9) and node_5 at (4.3,3.0) offer stable geometry but could be slightly adjusted to favor load distribution. Closed structure confirmed without isolated members or nodes.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Member_6 area to be increased from \'1\': 0.195 to at least \'3\'=1.759 or \'4\'=3.128 to reduce peak stress on that branch. Slightly shift node_4 right and up (e.g., nearer to 2.85, 3.0) and node_5 slightly left and down (4.0, 2.95) for better triangularization spreading internal forces evenly. Usage of intermediate area ids balances mass vs stress. To keep total mass under 30, can slightly reduce member_8 area from large \'3\' 1.759 to \'1\' 0.195 if stress strain verified acceptable. Cross checking all members with reallocated area and geometry will define feasible improvement.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Optimize current design by slightly repositioning nodes 4 and 5 within 0.1 unit range to enhance triangulation, change member_6 area from \'1\' (0.195) to \'3\' (1.759) to significantly reduce its peak stress, reduce member_8 area from \'3\' to \'1\' to save mass and redistribute load. Keep other members\' areas from current or best historic design with minor resizing to maintain stable topology while lowering max stress and mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Load at node_3 with diagonal force requires strong load path balancing from nodes_1 and 2 via nodes 4 and 5. A near rise to run triangle formed by nodes 3,4,5 transmits forces effectively. Increasing area on most stressed member (6) will reduce peak stress directly by larger cross section. Slight node adjustments fine tune internal load paths yielding more favorable stress distributions. Reducing area of overdesigned members (8) lightens overall mass. Scaling member sizes to stress demand optimizes performance under constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Steel linear elastic, all members pin-jointed.
