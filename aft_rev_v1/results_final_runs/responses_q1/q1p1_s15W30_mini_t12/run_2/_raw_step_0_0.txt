Objective is minimizing stress within ±15 limit and total mass ≤ 30, using discrete cross-sectional areas while ensuring full static determinacy and structural integrity.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given 3 nodes mostly aligned on x-axis with a single downward-left load at node_3. Supports at nodes_1 (pinned) and 2 (roller). Need closed truss (triangular closure) and multiple members for stiffness. Cross-section area choices limited. Initial connectivity: node_1 - node_3, node_3 - node_2, node_2 - node_1 forms a triangle, adding intermediate node(s) if beneficial for stress reduction or mass.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The truss behaves as a triangle with forces transfer path: load at node_3, reactions at nodes_1 and 2. Vertical and horizontal force components at supports react load. Without internal nodes, the triangle will carry high tensile/compressive stresses due to load direction. Introducing a fourth node near load node_3, slightly above x-axis, creates two interconnected triangles providing alternative load paths and spreading forces reducing max stress. Supports: pinned at (0,0) constrains translation; roller at (6,0) constrains vertical. Stress limit ±15 and mass ≤30 pose tight constraints. Cross-sectional areas can be chosen larger where necessary (max 19.548) for highly loaded members, smaller otherwise. Member length times area (as proxy for mass) limited to 30 total, so area selection must balance force capacity vs mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulated layout improves stability and reduces member forces compared to a single triangle. Adding a fourth node elevates truss height, improving load paths by introducing vertical components and lowering overall axial stresses. Large area near high-force members needed but limited by mass. Using one additional node to form two triangles is efficient. Avoid redundancy in members. Validate member lengths for mass. Stress values can be estimated by static analysis (force equilibrium equations) assuming axial loads only.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Design includes all given nodes plus one new node (node_4) at (3.00, 1.80) to form two triangles: node_1 - node_3 - node_4 and node_4 - node_3 - node_2 - node_1. This creates a stable closed truss with efficient load transfer reducing max axial forces. Use largest area_id for members suspect to highest load, smaller areas for others to optimize mass. Choose members to avoid redundancy but ensure connectivity and closed loop. This approach uses triangulation principle, balancing mass and stress constraints while achieving allowable load paths and stable reaction force transfer.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Truss members only axial forces, supports react accordingly.
