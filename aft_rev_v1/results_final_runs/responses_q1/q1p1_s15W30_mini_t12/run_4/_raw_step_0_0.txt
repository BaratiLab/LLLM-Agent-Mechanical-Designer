Objective: minimize stress under load (-10 N at 45° down left) while ensuring total mass ≤30 and stresses ≤±15, by creating a closed connected triangulated structure.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes are colinear with node_3 loaded down-left, supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller. A closed truss must connect node_1, node_2, node_3 and possibly new nodes forming triangles for load distribution. Triangulation needed for stability and stress minimization. Max 3 nodes insufficient to close a polygon without overforming, so add one node above baseline for triangle formation.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-10 N, 45° left downward) acts to pull wall backward and downward. Supports fix node_1 fully, roller at node_2 allows horizontal displacement but restrains vertical. Members must carry vertical and horizontal components. Without vertical stiffness on the right, node_2 will experience vertical displacement; hence a truss member is added diagonally to form triangle and carry axial force. Load path will utilize member node_3 to new upper node to node_1 and node_2. This improves load distribution and reduces stress concentrations compared with linear members.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Key insight: creating a triangle with node_3—new node—node_1 allows resolving applied load into axial member forces better. For mass concerns, area selection needs optimization — use smallest area for longest members and proportionally larger area for highest force members to keep max stress ≤15. New node to be placed within span around (3.0, 3.0) vertically to balance member lengths and angles.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Add one new node_4 at (3.0, 3.0) - midpoint horizontally offset and raised. Form members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_2 to close truss. This forms multiple triangles, load distributed through member axial loads. Use truss design principles with careful area choice - largest cross-section in members exposed to highest force, smaller area in minor force members to control mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic, no buckling, axial forces only, loadsed result in static equilibrium. Calculate length of members l_ij = sqrt((xj - xi)^2 + (yj - yi)^2). Calculate forces using equilibrium equations on nodes, then stresses σ = P/A. Mass = sum(length * area_value). Set areas from given discrete area_id keys, pick areas minimizing mass yet constraining |σ| ≤ 15 (force capacity).
