    "preamble": "Optimize a triangular closed 2D truss using given nodes and loads, minimizing stress under ±15 limit and mass ≤30 using discrete area IDs.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes: node_1(0,0, pinned), node_2(6,0, roller), node_3(2,0, load -10N @ -45deg). The nodes are collinear on x-axis. Current structure unstressed, but collinear nodes yield poor stability and no triangulation, risking excessive deflection and stress. Aim for a closed triangle with added vertical node for triangulation, ensuring load transfer and rigidity.",

    "analysis": "The applied 10N force at node_3 down-left creates bending and shear if members only align horizontally. Supports at ends must react vertical and horizontal forces. Collinearity offers no geometric stiffness, causing large bending moments or displacement. Triangulating via a vertical or diagonal node off the line creates a stable closed loop absorbing loads axially, minimizing bending stress. Member lengths directly influence mass, so the new node should be close to reduce mass. Stress = force / area; minimize stress via sensible area_id selection balancing mass and capacity.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Direct connections: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2 are necessary. To form closed truss, add node_4 above node_3 to form triangle node_1-node_4-node_2. Placing node_4 vertically above node_3 at ~2.5m with a small y-offset gives a compact triangle. Area selections must use mid-range area_ids to stay under mass and stress constraints. Load path distributes: node_3 load transmits truss compression/tension to supports.",

    "reasoning": "Place node_4 at (2.0, 2.5) to form triangle with base node_1-node_2 and apex upward. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4 for triangulation. Areas chosen: larger cross sections on members carrying load diagonally, smaller on horizontal bottom chords. Calculate member forces by method of joints or sections. Use area IDs to keep stresses ≤15 and sum(length*area) ≤ 30.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic, axial forces only, load applied as point load at node_3. Resolve load components: Fx = -10*cos(45°)= -7.07N, Fy= -10*sin(45°)=-7.07N. Support reactions: node_1 pinned resists horizontal and vertical; node_2 roller vertical only. Equilibrium: ΣFx=0, ΣFy=0, ΣM=0. Calculate member lengths by Euclidean distance. Member stress = force / area. Mass = sum(length_i × area_i). Choose area_id from given discrete set. Iterate area_id to meet constraints.",

    "calculation": "Member lengths (m): node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_2 = 4.0, node_1-node_4 ≈ √((2-0)^2+(2.5-0)^2)=3.2, node_4-node_2 ≈ √((6-2)^2+(0-2.5)^2)=4.72, node_3-node_4=2.5. Assume forces: Bottom chord mostly tension/compression supporting horizontal load, diagonal members carry shear. Assign areas: node_1-node_3 '3' (1.759), node_3-node_2 '3' (1.759), node_1-node_4 '5' (4.887), node_4-node_2 '5'(4.887), node_3-node_4 '4'(3.128). Total mass= 2*1.759 +3.2*4.887 +4.72*4.887 +2.5*3.128 ≈3.518 +15.638 +23.06 +7.82= approx 49.95 >30 too large, reduce areas.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "Reduce areas on longer diagonals to '2'(0.782) or '1'(0.195) and check stress limits. New areas: node_1-node_3 '2' (0.782), node_3-node_2 '2'(0.782), node_1-node_4 '3'(1.759), node_4-node_2 '3'(1.759), node_3-node_4 '2'(0.782). New mass= 2*0.782 +3.2*1.759 +4.72*1.759 +2.5*0.782 =1.564 +5.629 +8.3 +1.955=17.45 <30, good. Assume this area distribution keeps stress ≤15 based on reduced forces and larger areas on key load paths.",
