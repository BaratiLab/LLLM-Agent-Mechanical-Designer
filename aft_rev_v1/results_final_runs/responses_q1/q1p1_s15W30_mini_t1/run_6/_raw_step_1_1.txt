Existing design meets constraints but max stress is near allowed limit. Objective is to lower stress further, maintain closed connectivity, keep supports fixed, and remain under mass limit.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "4 nodes forming a quadrilateral with cross members. Node_1 pinned at origin, node_2 roller at (6,0), node_3 under diagonal load, node_4 elevated. Members sized variably by discrete area IDs. Constraints max stress ±15 and mass ≤ 30 met currently. Stress distribution shows member_2 highly stressed in compression. Member_3 has zero area, possibly ineffective.",\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 pulls diagonally down-left, transferring forces through node_3 members to supports at nodes_1 and 2. Member_2 (node_3 to node_4) has high compressive stress (-10.8675), likely controlling load path. Member_3 (node_4 to node_1) currently zero area, not contributing structurally, may be weakening triangle stability. Members on bottom chord (node_1 to 3 and 3 to 2) moderate stress. Using a zero-area member breaks triangulation and stiffness. Mass is low enough (18.1571 < 30), so increasing critical member areas should reduce stress peaks. Node positions for supports and load fixed, node_4 can be slightly adjusted to improve geometry and reduce compressive force on member_2. Node_4 at (4,3) slightly skewing geometry; raising it closer to an apex over midpoint between node_2 and node_1 might help balance stresses. History shows no better structures than current.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Pattern: member_2 compression is limiting factor. Member_3 zero area may reduce stiffness. There is slack in mass budget (total mass < 20 out of max 30). Small node_4 vertical repositioning could reduce member_2 stress. Increase area on highly stressed members_2 and _1. Adding area to member_3 will restore triangulation rigidity and aid load path. Current design good but can be improved by minor geometry tweaks and area reassignment.",\n    "proposal": "Increase member_2 area from \'2\' to \'3\' or \'4\', increase member_1 area from \'3\' to \'4\', assign member_3 area = \'2\' (nonzero) to restore triangulation rigidity. Adjust node_4 upwards to (4.00, 3.20) to improve geometry without violating constraints or changing nodes with supports/loads. Keep members_4 and _5 area same or decrease slightly to maintain mass budget.",\n    "reasoning": "Better triangulation by restoring member_3 area ensures more stiffness, reducing stress on member_2. Increasing cross section in members carrying high stress distributes force over larger area, reducing stress magnitude. Raising node_4 vertically shifts load paths to reduce compression in member_2. Node_1 and node_2 fixed as supports; node_3 fixed by load. Changing only node_4 within small range avoids destabilizing supports. Maintaining a closed 4-node polygon with cross braces ensures structural stability and stiffness.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: L_13, L_34, L_41, L_32, L_24 with updated coordinates.
