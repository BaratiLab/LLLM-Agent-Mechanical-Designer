  "preamble": "Current structure is a 4-node truss with a load at node_3 and supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). It violates max stress and mass constraints (max stress 25.49 >15, mass 40.4 >30). Objective is to design a closed 2D truss minimizing stress, mass ≤30, max stress ≤ ±15, maintaining supports and load positions.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current design is a trapezoidal 4-node truss with diagonal and chord members. One member (node_3-node_1) has excessive compressive stress (-25.49). Total mass is high due to large cross-sections to reduce stress. Load is moderate (-10 at 45° down-left on node_3). History shows no better structure. Constraints violated: max stress and mass.",
  "analysis": "Load at node_3 pointing diagonally downward left induces high compression in member node_3-node_1. The structure lacks triangulation to efficiently distribute forces, causing stress concentration and necessitating large cross-section areas and mass. The span between node_1 and node_2 is 6m with a mid-level node_4 at (2,3). The member node_3-node_1 carries heavy compression, likely due to inefficient load paths. Supports fix global translation for stability. Structure is closed but inefficient. Mass could be lowered by better force path and smaller area members.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Key issue is the long span under load with direct connection from node_3 to node_1 causing large compression. Adding nodes and more triangulation could reduce stresses and allow smaller cross sections. Moving node_3 is not possible. Node_4 can be repositioned. Introducing an intermediate node near load to transfer forces could improve. Symmetry and triangulation will help. Reducing chord lengths or adding vertical posts would help too.",
  "proposal": "Redesign structure by repositioning node_4 higher and adding one more node (node_5) near node_3 upwards to create a two-triangle vertical truss with effective load transfer paths. Connect node_5 to node_3, node_4, and possibly node_2. This will triangulate and reduce compression in member node_3-node_1 and lower mass by using lower area members. Maintain supports at node_1 and node_2 and load at node_3 unchanged.",
  "reasoning": "Create a square-truss-like shape with a vertical line from the base at node_3 to node_5 high above. This will let load at node_3 transfer upward reducing compression on node_3-node_1. Adding node_5 at about (2.0, 5.0) and moving node_4 to (4.0,4.0) creates a better triangulated shape with smaller diagonal members. Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_3-node_2. Use smaller areas on less stressed members and assign bigger areas to vertical/load carrying members. Keep overall mass under 30 and max stress below 15.",
