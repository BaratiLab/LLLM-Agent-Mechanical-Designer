  "preamble": "Current 2D truss structure under a single load (-10N at node_3) with supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller) exceeds max stress (27.03 > 15) and has high mass (21.83). Objective: develop a closed truss satisfying max stress ±15 and total mass <=30 while maintaining supports and load positions.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Structure must be closed and connected; load is downward-left at node_3, supports fix the base horizontally and vertically. Current members have imbalanced stresses with some excessively high. History shows similar designs with better stress but higher mass. Node 5 position varies; adding triangulation helps reduce stress.",
  
  "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-10N, -45°) creates tension and compression in members connected to node_3 and neighbors. Pinned support at node_1 restrains horizontal and vertical displacements, roller at node_2 restrains vertical displacement. Current design's max stress 27.03 exceeds ±15 constraint, likely from insufficient triangulation around node_3 and unbalanced member sizing. Structures in history with more triangulation (e.g., members around node_5) reduce max stress but increase mass. The current design has minimal cross bracing leading to high local stresses.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: triangulated nodes near load improve stress distribution. Having node_5 positioned more central and connected to nodes_1,3,4 reduces stress peaks. Increasing member cross-section area in highly stressed members reduces stress but adds mass. Symmetry and triangulation at top chords recommended.",
  
  "proposal": "Redesign structure with a 5-node truss incorporating full triangulation and balanced member sizing. Fix nodes 1 and 2 at given positions and keep node_3 fixed (load point). Shift node_5 slightly lower than in history to improve geometry, connect all nodes to form closed loops with triangulation to balance load. Use moderate area sizes for efficiency (1.5 to 4.9 range).",
  
  "reasoning": "Triangulated truss with nodes: base at node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0, load applied), node_4(4,3.46), and node_5(3,2.5) gives good triangle shape. Members connect all nodes to create multiple load paths. Supports restrain base nodes well. Using moderate area sizes for longer members to reduce stress and smaller areas for shorter members to reduce mass. Since node_3 is load node and fixed, no repositioning of constrained/support nodes to avoid load/support constraint violations.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions:\n- Members only carry axial force\n- Load of 10N at 45° angle transforms to Fx = -7.07N, Fy = -7.07N at node_3\n- Support reactions resolve equilibrium\n- Calculate member lengths by Euclidean distance\n- Member mass = length * area (area values per area_id)\n- Stress ∝ axial force / cross-sectional area, so select area to keep max stress ≤15\nSteps:\n- Calculate geometry\n- Equilibrium of joints considering forces\n- Estimate forces via method of joints\n- Adjust areas to keep stress ≤15\n- Sum mass and check ≤30\n- Iteration if constraints not met",
