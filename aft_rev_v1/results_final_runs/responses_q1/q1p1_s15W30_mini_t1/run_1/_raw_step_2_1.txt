Objective is to design a closed 2D truss structure satisfying max stress ±15 and total mass ≤30, while keeping supports and loads fixed and ensuring connectivity and structural efficiency.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given load at node_3 is downward-left (-10, -45°). Supports are pinned at node_1 (0, 0) and roller at node_2 (6, 0). Current design mass slightly exceeds 30. Two previous designs in history also violate constraints or have high mass. Aim is a lighter, closed truss with effective load transfer and minimal stress concentration.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current structure is a 5-node truss with nodes roughly forming a tall triangle with an apex node_5 elevated. Members radiate around node_3, the loading point, and support nodes at base. The load causes compression in some members and tension in others as seen in stresses (-11.4 is near limit). The main mass contributor is long members with large cross-sections (e.g. member_6 connecting node_2 and node_5). Historical structures show attempts with simpler 4-node trapezoidal shapes or slightly different triangulations but had mass or stress issues. The challenge is reducing member areas and lengths while keeping all nodes connected and stable under load with low stress and below mass limit.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Noticing mass of current design dominated by some large area members spanning base to higher nodes. Node_5 location at (3,5) maybe too high increasing member lengths and thus mass. Load at node_3 near base suggests a more compact truss can distribute forces better. Triangulation is critical. Reducing height of node_5 and rearranging connections can lower member length and enable smaller area choice. Ensuring all nodes connected in closed loop with triangulation is necessary for stability.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Propose a redesigned 5-node closed truss reducing node_5 height to about 3.0, reposition node_4 slightly lower and closer to node_3 for better triangulation. Connect members forming two triangles with base between node_1 and node_2, joined by diagonals to nodes_4 and 5. Use smaller area sections for most members, reserving larger areas only for members directly under load. This should reduce mass below 30 and keep max stress within ±15.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Using triangular configurations allows efficient load transfer from loaded node_3 to supports at node_1 and node_2. Lowering nodes_4 and 5 reduces member lengths and mass. Keeping node_3 fixed enforces load position and symmetry around it improves force balance. Cross sections selected based on expected axial forces: compressive members under high load get moderate to high area, others minimal area. This balances stress and mass.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Nodes fixed as given for supports and load; load vector decomposed into (Fx, Fy) = (-10*cos45°, -10*sin45°) ≈ (-7.07, -7.07). Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance. Total mass=sum(member length × area_id value). Check max stress assuming direct axial load proportional to force/members’ area and length. Adjust node_4 and node_5 y-coordinates from 4.0 and 5.0 to ~3.46 and ~3.0 respectively. Proposed areas span low (0.195,0.782) to moderate (1.759) to save weight.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths approximated: \'node_1\'-\'node_3\' ~2.0, \'node_3\'-\'node_4\' ~1.8, \'node_1\'-\'node_4\' ~3.77, \'node_4\'-\'node_5\' ~1.1, \'node_5\'-\'node_3\' ~1.4, \'node_2\'-\'node_5\' ~3.16, \'node_3\'-\'node_2\' ~4.0. Selecting areas: large load bearing members with area_id \'2\'=0.782 or \'3\'=1.759, lighter members \'1\'=0.195. Estimating total mass ~ (2×1.759)+(1.8×0.782)+(3.77×0.195)+(1.1×0.195)+(1.4×0.782)+(3.16×0.782)+(4.0×0.195)= approx 2*1.759=3.518 +1.4 + 0.735+ 0.215 +1.09 +2.47 +0.78 = about 9.7 mass units, well below 30, ensuring feasibility.
