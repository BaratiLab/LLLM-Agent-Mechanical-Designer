The optimization goal is to redesign a closed 2D truss that meets max stress ≤ 15 and mass ≤ 30 while maintaining supports and load nodes unchanged.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given a load of -10N at node_3 at -45 degrees, pinned support at node_1, and roller at node_2, the design must transfer load efficiently to supports. Nodes are mostly coplanar with heights ~3 to 5m. Prior best historic structures yielded lower stress but higher mass. Current mass is low but stress is too high, indicating weak members or inefficient load paths.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The existing 5-node design shows that member_3 (node_4-node_1) has excessive tensile stress 36.95. This suggests that the load path through node_4 is overloaded. Member areas are small for high-stress members. The structure contains triangles but has an off-centered load at node_3 between supports at nodes 1 and 2. Member_4 (node_4-node_5) and member_7 (node_3-node_2) carry moderate stress. The current topology is a triangle with a smaller inner triangle (node_3, node_4, node_5) but member sizing is insufficient. The historic first structure with 4 nodes (node_1, 2, 3, 4) had max stress within ±15 but mass was very high (~54). The 5-node historic design had stress ~11.4 and mass ~32 above limits. Hence, adding an intermediate node is beneficial but mass must be controlled by selecting smaller areas. The load at node_3 is downward-left; thus, load paths must channel this force effectively to anchored nodes.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "The stress violation occurs mainly in the member connecting higher nodes to node_1. Reducing length or increasing area helps, but mass must remain under 30. Triangulation is key, especially adding cross bracing to stabilize lateral forces from the angled load. Node_5 at (3,3) introduces useful height but may increase load on members if not effectively braced. Symmetry helped reduce stress in historic designs but resulted in high mass. Focusing on a slightly lower height triangular shape with well-selected members and areas can reduce both stress and mass.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Propose a 4-node, 6-member closed truss with nodes at supports and load points plus one intermediate node placed at (3.00,2.60) to improve load path triangulation. Replace node_5 with this better-positioned node to form two balanced triangles sharing node_3 and node_4 with optimized member sizes. Use moderate areas selected from the given area_id, generally 0.782 to 3.128 range to balance mass and strength.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "The truss will have nodes at: node_1 (0,0) pinned, node_2 (6,0) roller, node_3 (2,0) load application, node_4 (4,3.46) existing, and new node_5 repositioned at (3.00,2.60). Connect nodes to form two triangles (node_1, node_3, node_5) and (node_5, node_4, node_2) plus cross bracing (node_3-node_4). This triangular layout supports load transfer well. Members will be sized to keep stress ≤15 and total mass ≤30 by varying areas between 0.782 (area_id \'2\') and 3.128 (area_id \'4\'). This approach uses symmetry for equilibrium and triangulation to stabilize the structure. Members connected respecting shortest length first to minimize mass. Supports and loaded nodes remain fixed.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: members behave linear-elastic with uniform area; load magnitude and direction given; supports fully restrain node_1, roller allows horizontal displacement at node_2. Use basic trigonometry to compute member lengths and angles, calculate approximate axial forces via equilibrium equations at nodes. Estimate stress=force/area, mass = sum(length × area × density (density scaled out as relative mass units)).
