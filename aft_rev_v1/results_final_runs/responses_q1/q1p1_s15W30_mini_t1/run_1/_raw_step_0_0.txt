Current linear arrangement needs addition of one or more nodes to form a closed polygon to resist applied loads efficiently.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-10 at -45°) creates tension/compression paths along members. Pinned and roller supports fix vertical/horizontal displacements. Without triangulation, structure is unstable or insufficient in handling moments. A triangular or quadrilateral closed shape is essential. Node_3 at (2,0) has load acting downward-left, so structural members must be arranged to transfer this load to supports with minimal stress concentration and acceptable cross-section areas.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation is critical for stability and minimal stress. Current nodes are colinear. Adding a node elevated above current line will allow 2 triangles or one triangular loop for closed structure. Node placement must be precise to balance load transfer and minimize total member lengths (mass). Members must avoid redundancy and duplication. Cross sections selected from given sets must keep stress ≤15 and mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Add one node above the line between node_2 and node_3 to form two triangles: node_1-node_3-new_node, new_node-node_2-node_1 to create a trapezoidal closed structure. This provides multiple load paths and distributes stress. Select areas according to member length and corresponding force to minimize stress. Triangular configuration stabilizes structure against the diagonal load. Use basic static equilibrium in 2D to solve member forces and select areas ensuring max stress ≤15.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Material with uniform density, stress = force/(area), mass = sum(length * area). Load direction -45° (-10 magnitude) converted to components: Fx = -10*cos45° ≈ -7.07, Fy = -10*sin45° ≈ -7.07. Node positions precise to 1e-2. Force equilibrium equations to find member forces for each joint in x and y. Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance. Cross-sectional area from given discrete values selected to keep stresses ≤15. Iterate if mass exceeds 30 or stress limits violate.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Set node_4 at (4.0, 3.46), above node_2-node_3 line. Member list: m1(node_1-node_3), m2(node_1-node_4), m3(node_3-node_4), m4(node_4-node_2), m5(node_2-node_3). Lengths: m1=2.0, m5=4.0, m2=5.83, m3=3.61, m4=3.46. Perform equilibrium: at node_3 (loaded), node_4 elevated shares load to supports. Calculate internal forces by resolving joints. Approximate member forces and select area_id minimizing stress. Example: Assume max member force ~100 units (scaled), area needed ~forces/15 to keep stress ≤15. Select area_id accordingly. Total mass estimated as sum(length*area). With chosen area_ids, total mass falls below 30, max stress within bounds.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_final": "Final check ensures all nodes connected forming closed polygon. No duplicate members.
