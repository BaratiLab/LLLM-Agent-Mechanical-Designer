The goal is a minimal stress closed truss within max stress ±15 and total mass ≤30, using discrete cross-section areas from provided IDs.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes given are colinear along the x-axis: node_1 at (0,0), node_3 at (2,0), node_2 at (6,0). Force (-10.0, -45°) at node_3 creates tension and compression in members. Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Area choices discrete. Must form a closed truss (loop). Basic three-node triangle not possible since nodes lie colinear. Need a new node off the line for triangulation.",\n\n    "analysis": "Since initial nodes are colinear, the truss cannot be closed and triangulated with just these three. The load at node_3 pulls down-left at 45°, creating combined vertical and horizontal reactions at supports. To resist this efficiently, add a new node above nodes_1-3-2 to form a triangular frame. Members arranged should efficiently transfer load in compression and tension within allowable stress limits. Members must be chosen from given area sizes; larger areas reduce stress but increase mass. Mass must ≤30, so selectively choose areas. Assume material density and stress proportional to force/area. Members must form a closed triangular loop including all four nodes.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a single node above (x=4.0, y=3.5) creates a triangle with base nodes 1 and 2, connecting to node_3 inside the base runs. Members: (1-3), (3-2), (1-4), (2-4), (3-4). Geometry provides rigid triangulation for load paths. Load at node_3 transfers via members (3-4), (1-3), (2-3). Chosen member sizes balancing stress and mass. Area sizes between 1.759 and 7.037 for main tension members, smaller for others to keep mass low.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Triangulation reduces bending, concentrates axial loads in members. Placing node_4 above creates two triangles: (1,3,4) and (3,2,4) forming the closed truss. Use larger cross-section on members carrying compression or tension from load at node_3 to support ±15 stress limit. Members along base shorter and carry lower forces can have smaller areas. Supports transfer reaction forces through these triangulated members. This design follows best practice for truss stability and load distribution while maintaining mass under 30.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members are pin-jointed, axial forces only. Use statics: sum forces x=0, y=0 and moments=0 to find member forces. Area chosen to keep stress = force/area ≤ 15. Mass calculated as sum(member_length × chosen_area). Node_4 placed at (4.0, 3.5) to maximize triangulation height without excessive member length and mass. Use discrete area sizes: area_id \'3\' (1.759), \'4\'(3.128), \'6\'(7.037), balancing stress and mass contribution.",\n\n    "calculation": "Member lengths: (1-3)=2.0m, (3-2)=4.0m, (1-4)=√((4-0)² + (3.5)²)=5.315m, (2-4)=√((6-4)²+(0-3.5)²)=3.8079m, (3-4)=√((4-2)²+ (3.5)²)=4.0311m. Approximate forces by decomposing external load (-10N at 45°): Fx = -7.07N, Fy= -7.07N at node_3. Reaction forces at supports calculated via equilibrium (sum Fx=0, Fy=0, moment). Distribute forces into members via method of joints: members (1-3) and (3-2) carry horizontal load; vertical loads carried by members connected to node_4. Estimated member forces imply max stress under 15 choosing areas: (1-3): area_id \'4\'(3.128), (3-2): \'4\'(3.128), (1-4): \'6\'(7.037), (2-4): \'6\'(7.037), (3-4): \'3\'(1.759). Total mass approx: (2*3.128)+(4*3.128)+(5.315*7.037)+(3.808*7.037)+(4.031*1.759)=6.256+12.512+37.39+26.79+7.1=~90 kg exceeds mass limit. Reduce some areas: set (1-4) and (2-4) to \'4\'(3.128) mass gain lowers by about factor 2.2. New total mass ~6.256+12.512+16.63+11.9+7.1=54.4 still >30. Reduce (3-4) to \'1\'(0.195) area. New sum ~6.256+12.512+16.63+11.9+0.76=47 still >30. Reduce further (1-3) and (3-2) to \'1\'(0.195) area: mass= (2*0.195)+(4*0.195)+(5.315*3.128)+(3.808*3.128)+(4.031*0.195)=0.39+0.78+16.62+11.91+0.79=30.5 close to 30 limit. Check stress with reduced areas; max stress slightly above limit but still close. Minor adjustment of node_4 height to 3.3m lowers member lengths.
