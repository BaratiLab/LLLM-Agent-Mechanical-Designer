  "preamble": "The given truss structure with 4 nodes and 5 members at iteration 1/25 violates the total mass constraint (mass=36.6469 > 30) despite having max stress within ±15. The objective is to generate a closed 2D truss with all nodes connected that satisfies max stress ≤ 15 and total mass ≤ 30 while minimizing stress and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Initial structure nodes fixed at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 (load), node_4 (top node). Load applied downward-left on node_3. Member cross-section vary from 2 to 5 currently, causing excessive mass in members connected to node_4. Constraint violated is the total mass >30 despite max stress=9.37 < 15.",
  "analysis": "The load acts on node_3 angled -45°, inducing both tension and compression in members meeting at node_3 and node_4. The largest mass contributor is member_3 (node_1 to node_4) with area 5 (4.887 from area_id) and the longest length (~4.8 m). The structure is stable (pinned + roller supports), but member sizing is inefficient. History shows a previous design with lower mass (24.16) but slightly higher max stress (7.94). The previous design used smaller cross-sections (areas 2,3) and a slightly lower top node elevation (3.50 vs 3.7). Load path transfers force poorly in current design, concentrating stress in member_5 (node_3-node_4) with -9.37 max stress.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing area on large mass members and slightly lowering node_4 to reduce member length will reduce mass and possibly stress. Using cross-sections in the range 2-3 (0.782 to 3.128) rather than 5 (4.887) can reduce mass considerably. Maintaining triangulation between nodes 1-3-4-2 is key to structural stability. Load acting at node_3 requires strong members between node_3 and nodes 1,2,4.",
  "proposal": "Reuse the historic design from rank_1 with refined node_4 lowered to 3.50 from 3.70, and assign cross-sectional areas as in rank_1 (areas 2 or 3) on members. This design has lower mass (24.17) and acceptable max stress (7.94) < 15. The truss remains closed and all nodes connected. Node coordinates for nodes with supports and load remain fixed; node_4 lowered as allowed to optimize mass and stress.",
  "reasoning": "The historic design shows good feasibility. Triangulation among nodes provides load path integrity. Lowering node_4 reduces member lengths to node_4, decreasing mass and bending moments. Choosing mid-size areas from area_id 2 and 3 balance stress and mass. Members between node_3 and nodes 1,2,4 sized 3 to handle tension/compression from 45° load angle. Symmetry is not required but triangulation is critical. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) ensure statical determinacy. This design respects constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assume members are linear axial force members with forces proportional to load magnitude and geometry. Calculate member length as euclidean distance. Mass = length × area. Assign area from area_id to members as in rank_1 structure. Check max stress using previous results as proxy and confirm mass ≤30. Node_4 at (3.00, 3.50).",
  "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1(0.00,0.00), node_2(6.00,0.00), node_3(2.00,0.00), node_4(3.00,3.50). Member lengths approximate: m1: |0,0 - 2,0|=2.00 m, m2: |2,0 -6,0|=4.00 m, m3: |0,0 -3,3.5|=4.30 m, m4: |3,3.5 -6,0|=4.30 m, m5: |2,0 -3,3.5|=3.64 m. Assign member areas from area_id as per rank_1: m1=3(1.759), m2=3(1.759), m3=2(0.782), m4=2(0.782), m5=3(1.759). Mass approx = Σ length*area = 2*1.759 + 4*1.759 +4.3*0.782 +4.3*0.782 +3.64*1.759 = 3.518 + 7.036 +3.364 +3.364 +6.402 = 23.68 < 30. Max stress estimated from history = 7.94 < 15. Constraints satisfied.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Final design satisfies max stress ≤ 15 and total mass ≤ 30. All nodes connected in closed truss. Prefers historic structure with slight node_4 adjustment to 3.50 for efficiency. No positions changed at nodes with supports or loads. Cross-sectional areas from feasible area_id values assigned. Load paths well resolved. Structure stable and optimal within given data.",
