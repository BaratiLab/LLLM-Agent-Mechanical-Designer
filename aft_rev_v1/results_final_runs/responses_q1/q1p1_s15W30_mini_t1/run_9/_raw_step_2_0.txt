The objective is to generate a closed 2D truss with all nodes connected that satisfies max stress ≤ 15 and total mass ≤ 30 while minimizing stress and mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Initial structure nodes fixed at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 (load), node_4 (top node). Load applied downward-left on node_3. Member cross-section vary from 2 to 5 currently, causing excessive mass in members connected to node_4. Constraint violated is the total mass >30 despite max stress=9.37 < 15.",\n  "analysis": "The load acts on node_3 angled -45°, inducing both tension and compression in members meeting at node_3 and node_4. The largest mass contributor is member_3 (node_1 to node_4) with area 5 (4.887 from area_id) and the longest length (~4.8 m). The structure is stable (pinned + roller supports), but member sizing is inefficient. History shows a previous design with lower mass (24.16) but slightly higher max stress (7.94). The previous design used smaller cross-sections (areas 2,3) and a slightly lower top node elevation (3.50 vs 3.7). Load path transfers force poorly in current design, concentrating stress in member_5 (node_3-node_4) with -9.37 max stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing area on large mass members and slightly lowering node_4 to reduce member length will reduce mass and possibly stress. Using cross-sections in the range 2-3 (0.782 to 3.128) rather than 5 (4.887) can reduce mass considerably. Maintaining triangulation between nodes 1-3-4-2 is key to structural stability. Load acting at node_3 requires strong members between node_3 and nodes 1,2,4.",\n  "proposal": "Reuse the historic design from rank_1 with refined node_4 lowered to 3.50 from 3.70, and assign cross-sectional areas as in rank_1 (areas 2 or 3) on members. This design has lower mass (24.17) and acceptable max stress (7.94) < 15. The truss remains closed and all nodes connected. Node coordinates for nodes with supports and load remain fixed; node_4 lowered as allowed to optimize mass and stress.",\n  "reasoning": "The historic design shows good feasibility. Triangulation among nodes provides load path integrity. Lowering node_4 reduces member lengths to node_4, decreasing mass and bending moments. Choosing mid-size areas from area_id 2 and 3 balance stress and mass. Members between node_3 and nodes 1,2,4 sized 3 to handle tension/compression from 45° load angle. Symmetry is not required but triangulation is critical. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) ensure statical determinacy. This design respects constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assume members are linear axial force members with forces proportional to load magnitude and geometry. Calculate member length as euclidean distance. Mass = length × area. Assign area from area_id to members as in rank_1 structure. Check max stress using previous results as proxy and confirm mass ≤30. Node_4 at (3.00, 3.50).",\n  "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1(0.00,0.00), node_2(6.00,0.00), node_3(2.00,0.00), node_4(3.00,3.50).
