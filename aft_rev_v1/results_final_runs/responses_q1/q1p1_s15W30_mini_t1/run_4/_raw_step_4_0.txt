The objective is to generate a closed truss with all nodes connected, minimizing max stress under ±15 and total mass ≤30, while respecting imposed loads and support conditions.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given a downward-left load of magnitude 10 at node_3, with node_1 pinned and node_2 roller supports at base y=0. Current members have uneven cross sections, and the highest compressive stress occurs in member_1 connecting node_1 to node_3. Historical structures with better stress distribution have node_4 repositioned to (4.0,4.0) and members with moderate area sizes achieved max stress ~8.53 and mass 27.58.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure fails max stress constraint mainly due to a small area (\'1\' = 0.195) at highly stressed member_1 and geometrical configuration that does not effectively triangulate load paths. The main load is on node_3 causing large compression in member_1. Member_5 connecting node_1 to node_4 is very large area (4) causing high mass concentration. Historic best solutions position node_4 near (4.0,4.0) and use larger areas for members connected to node_3 and node_4 to distribute stress. The triangular patterns formed in historic best designs spread loads evenly, reducing peak stresses while maintaining mass under 30. Current structure has a slightly lower mass but very high stress, indicating undersized critical members and suboptimal node placement.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangular closed shapes with node_4 shifted slightly right and up helps create a more efficient load path. Members adjacent to the loaded node_3 require higher section areas. Members on supports can be smaller area due to less stress. Minor repositioning to optimize geometry and appropriate area selection can reduce max stress to within limits while keeping total mass under 30.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Adopt node_4 position at (4.00, 4.00) from history best structure. Use a 5-member closed truss with nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (4,4), same load and supports. Increase member_1 area to \'4\' to reduce stress, assign appropriate intermediate areas to members_2 and 3, and keep members_4 and 5 with area \'1\' and \'2\' respectively to control mass. This follows a triangulated pattern with optimized areas and node layout known to satisfy constraints.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "The load at node_3 transmits to supports via node_4. Positioning node_4 at (4.0,4.0) creates better triangulation. Assigning larger cross-section area to member_1 (node_1-node_3) reduces stress drastically. Moderate area for members connecting node_3 to node_4 and node_4 to node_2 balances stress distribution. Smaller sections on base members reduce total mass while ensuring stability. The design is symmetric and closed, ensuring all nodes are connected without isolation. This results in max stress ~8.53, well under ±15, and total mass ~27.58 under 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic, static equilibrium. Member length = distance between nodes using Euclidean formula. Mass = sum over members of length × area. Stress proportional to axial force / cross-sectional area.
