    "preamble": "Current structure has high max stress (53.53) exceeding the ±15 constraint and total mass close to 25. The goal is to redesign the truss to satisfy max stress ≤ ±15 and mass ≤30 with a closed 2D truss, preserving supports and loaded nodes.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given load is a downward-left diagonal force at node_3, with supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Current nodes form a near-rectangle with node_3 and node_4 inside, but high stress in member_1 suggests it is overloaded with too small area or inefficient load path. Historic successful structure had node_4 shifted to (4,4) and larger cross sections for diagonal members. Mass was slightly higher (27.58), but stress well under limits.",
    "analysis": "The load at node_3 (-10N at -45°) induces tension and compression in members connected to node_3 and node_4. Current member_1 (node_1-node_3) with small area is overstressed (abs 53.53 > 15). The triangle formed by nodes 1-3-4 is not sufficiently triangulated with strong cross-bracing. Member_5 (node_1-node_4) is thick but does not fully relieve stress on member_1. The rectangular frame with diagonal creates bending moments, but lack of an additional diagonal brace limits stiffness and increases stress. Previous ranked structure had node_4 at (4,4) instead of (4,4.2), and used larger areas (3 and 4) for diagonal members, reducing stresses below 9 and satisfying mass < 30. Supports are adequate for load path. The current structure's failure arises from insufficient cross-sectional area on critical members and suboptimal node positioning.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "Load paths must be direct from node_3 to supports. Triangulation with two diagonal members (node_1-node_4 and node_3-node_4) of moderate cross-section reduces stress concentration. Increasing node_4 height slightly to 4.00m rather than 4.20m improves geometry and force transmission. Using moderate areas (area ids '2', '3', '4') on diagonal and base members balances mass and strength. The pinned and roller supports provide statically determinate support ensuring determinable load paths.",
    "proposal": "Reuse the historic best structure from generation history with slight adjustments: set node_4 at (4.00, 4.00) for optimized triangulation, use cross sections area_id '4' (3.128) for node_1-node_3, '3' (1.759) for node_3-node_4 and node_4-node_2, small area_id '1' (0.195) for node_2-node_1 base member, and area_id '2' (0.782) for node_1-node_4 diagonal. This configuration is fully triangulated, closed, and satisfies all constraints with max stress ~8.53 and total mass ~27.58.",
    "reasoning": "Triangulated closed truss efficiently distributes loads, reducing member stresses. Keeping supports fixed, the position of node_4 at 4.00 m height gives better angles improving load transfer from node_3 through node_4 to node_2 and node_1. Area selections provide sufficient capacity in critical load paths while keeping total mass under limit. Avoiding too large or too small areas balances both stress and mass. This design leverages proven historic solution and known physical principles of triangulated frames.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic behavior, negligible member self-weight. Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance. Member mass = length × area (proportional to id value). Member stress proportional to member force / area. Forces resolved via static equilibrium and truss analysis. Cross-sectional areas taken from area_id dict. Check max stress ≤ 15 and total mass ≤ 30. Node_3 position fixed at (2.00, 0.00) and load (-10N, -45°) applied. Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 fixed. Check no isolated nodes and fully closed truss.",
    "calculation": "Node lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.00 m, node_3-node_4 = sqrt((4-2)^2+(4-0)^2)=sqrt(4+16)=4.47 m, node_4-node_2 = sqrt((6-4)^2+(0-4)^2)=sqrt(4+16)=4.47 m, node_2-node_1=6.00 m, node_1-node_4=sqrt((4-0)^2+(4-0)^2)=5.66 m. Mass sum = 2×3.128 + 4.47×1.759 + 4.47×1.759 + 6×0.195 = approx. 27.58 (consistent). Max stress computed from forces on these lengths and selected cross sections stays below 9 (historic best). Constraints met.",
    "scratch_pad_final": "Design is fully triangulated closed truss with fixed supports and load node fixed. Member areas selected to ensure stress within ±15 and total mass below 30. Node positions are precise floats avoiding arbitrary rounding. Design matches historic optimized solution ensuring feasibility and optimization objectives. Ready to output final design dictionary.",
