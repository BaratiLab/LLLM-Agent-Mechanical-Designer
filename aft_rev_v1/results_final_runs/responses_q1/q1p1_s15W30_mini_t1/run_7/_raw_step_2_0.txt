The objective is to create a closed, statically efficient triangular truss that minimizes peak stress and stays under 30 total mass while keeping fixed supports and loaded nodes fixed in position.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given load at node_3 downward-left, pinned support at node_1(0,0), roller at node_2(6,0). Current max stress 4.93 below limit but mass 41.14 over 30. Existing members include base, vertical, diagonals and cross members. History shows attempts reducing mass violated stress constraints.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current structure distributes load inefficiently with oversized members to control stress, causing mass excess. The base is long (6m) with intermediate nodes at node_3(2,0) and node_4(2,3). The load on node_3 is eccentric causing bending-like forces in horizontal base members increasing stress. Vertical and diagonal members somewhat handle load but member_2 has low stress and large area (area 4). The structure is not optimally triangulated around load application leading to inefficient load path and heavy cross member_5. History confirms lighter designs lead to stress violation >15. A more compact, symmetric triangular truss with balanced load paths could improve stress distribution and mass efficiency.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Better to remove redundant members and adjust node positions for efficient triangulation. Keeping support and loaded nodes fixed, introducing an additional node could improve triangulation and reduce member lengths. Area sizes must be carefully chosen balancing stress and mass. Use fewer, well-oriented members to distribute force paths evenly. Avoid overly long base members or highly stressed diagonals.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign truss to 5 nodes creating two adjacent triangles sharing a common node above the loaded node to efficiently transfer load into supports. Keep node_1 and node_2 as supports and node_3 fixed loaded node. Add node_5 above node_3 on vertical line, and node_4 moved slightly right and higher to improve load distribution. Members form triangles node_1-node_5-node_3 and node_2-node_4-node_5 connected with diagonals. Adjust area assignments to match stress levels and achieve mass<30.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangular configuration using pinned and roller supports is statically determinate with good load distribution. Introducing node_5 (above load) creates efficient vertical load path from node_3 to node_5, then diagonal forces to supports. Node_4 shifted to reduce long horizontal base members load. Triangulation increases stiffness and minimizes bending moments. Use moderate areas (1.759 to 3.128) for diagonals to control stress without mass penalty. Base members similarly sized, vertical members sized to handle axial forces. This achieves lower stress peaks and reduced total mass below 30.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Material density uniform, stress proportional to axial force / area, member length by distance formula. Calculate member lengths, estimate forces using static equilibrium (sum forces & moments zero). Assign area to keep stress within ±15. Use areas: 3 (\'1.759\'), 4 (\'3.128\'), 2 (\'0.782\'). Mass = sum(length × area). Verify max stress ≤ 15, mass ≤ 30. Node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) fixed at (0,0) and (6,0), node_3 fixed loaded node (2,0). Place node_5 at (2,2.5), node_4 at (4,3) for compact triangles.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths (approx): node_1-node_3 = 2.0m, node_3-node_5 = 2.5m, node_5-node_1 = ~3.2016m, node_5-node_4 = ~2.2361m, node_4-node_2 = 3.1623m, node_3-node_4 = ~3.606m, node_1-node_2 = 6m.
