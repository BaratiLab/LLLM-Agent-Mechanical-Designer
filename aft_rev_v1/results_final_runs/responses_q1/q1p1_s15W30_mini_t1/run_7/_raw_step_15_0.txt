Objective is to reduce max stress closer to ±15 limit and possibly mass while maintaining closed structure and supports.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given load at node_3 (-10N, -45deg), supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller), 4 nodes forming a basic trapezoidal shape with diagonal braces. Existing cross-section sizes mostly area_id \'3\' (1.759) with some smaller areas. Constraints max stress ±15, total mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 acts diagonally down-left; force flows from node_3 to supports at node_1 and node_2. Members \'member_1\' (1-3), \'member_2\' (3-2), and diagonal \'member_5\' (3-4) carry major stresses. Highest tensile at member_3 (node_1-4) near 8.53 close to constraint. The mass is well within limits. Member_6 (1-2) shortest with smallest area. The truss is closed and connected. Generation history shows more complex designs with more nodes and members reduce stress but greatly increase mass violating constraint.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "The current 4-node design is effective in load transfer with minimal mass and no violations. Attempting more nodes/members adds mass and complexity without proven better performance within constraints. Reducing member_3 cross section slightly or node_4 vertical position tweak may reduce peak stress. Mass buffering exists for minor area increases or shape tweaks.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Optimize current 4-node trapezoidal truss by slightly adjusting node_4 vertical position upward (to better distribute load), and slightly adjusting member areas to reduce max stress below 8 while keeping total mass ≤30. Keep nodes with loads/supports fixed. Maintain closed geometry and 6 members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing node_4 height increases member_3 and member_4 length spreading axial forces, potentially lowering peak stress in member_3. Adjusting cross-sectional areas of high stress members allows stress balancing without mass increase. Triangulation preserved with member_5 diagonal. Node_3 fixed horizontally but shifting node_4 preserves geometry and supports. Keep boundary nodes fixed per Loads and Supports constraint.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assuming linear elastic axial force equilibrium, recalculate member lengths: member_3 and member_4 length affected by node_4 y-coordinate. Calculate stresses from internal forces = axial force / area. Mass = sum member_length * area_density; area_density from area_id dict values. Target max stress reduce from 8.53 to ~7.5-8.0 to improve safety margin. Total mass remain ≤30. Use area_ids: \'2\' (0.782), \'3\' (1.759) to balance stress/mass. Avoid areas \'0\' (1) for highest stressed member to lower mass. Keep node_3 and nodes 1 and 2 fixed in position per constraints.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node_4 current (3.0, 3.0).

Estimated mass = Σ (L_i * area_id_i). Total mass ≈ 3.518*2 + 1.759*4.04*2 + 1.759*3.31 + 0.195*6 = 7.036 + 14.22 + 5.82 + 1.17 = 28.25 < 30.
