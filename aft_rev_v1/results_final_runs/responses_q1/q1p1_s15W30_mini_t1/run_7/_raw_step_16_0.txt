Current structure meets constraints but max stress (8.2) is high; aim to reduce stress further by adjusting node 4 position and tuning member areas.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Current structure with nodes at (0,0),(6,0),(2,0),(3,3.25), six members, areas chosen mostly \'3\' & \'2\'. Max stress 8.2 within ±15, mass 24.62 < 30 limit. Load at node_3: -10 N at -45°, supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller).",\n  \n  "analysis": "The load at node_3 imposes tension/compression on members connected there, especially member_3 (node_1 to node_4) which has highest stress (8.20). The members form a closed quadrilateral with a diagonal for triangulation. Current design has a heavier diagonal member_5 (node_3-node_4) with area_id \'3\' which bears negative stress (-4.2). Smaller members connecting supports (node_1-node_2) have area \'1\' and low stress (-2.69). Load path is primarily from node_3 through node_4 and supports, but asymmetry in height of node_4 (3.25) may cause higher stresses.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Given the members and nodes are fixed in connectivity, adjusting node_4 height slightly down could reduce bending and max stress on member_3. Reducing diagonal/truss member areas selectively while maintaining stiffness is key. Avoid increasing mass beyond 30. Historical better ranks have node_4 at ~3.0 or slightly less height but with higher max stress or mass. Key: lowering node_4 slightly and lowering some member cross sections might yield lower max stress without mass increase.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Slightly lower node_4 y-coordinate from 3.25 to 3.0 or 2.85; keep other nodes fixed. Maintain same six members but lower area_id of member_3 and/or member_5 to \'2\' or \'1.759\' (id \'2\' or \'1\'). Reduce member_6 (tie between supports) area if stress very low to reduce mass. Aim to keep total mass under 25 and max stress under 8.0.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangulated closed truss with four nodes is adequate; elimination of any member breaks closure or rigidity. Node with load cannot move and supports fixed. Lowering node_4 reduces bending moment on member_3. Member areas chosen from provided discrete sizes balancing member forces. Member_3 (node_1-node_4) currently overstressed; lowering area_id from \'3\' (1.759) to \'2\' (0.782) or \'1\' (0.195) risks stress increase but smaller height compensates. Member_5 (diagonal) can also be tuned from \'3\' to \'2\' or \'1\'. Member_6 at \'1\' is small and under low stress, can consider reducing further. Member_1 and 2 sized \'3\' appear needed for force transfer. Symmetry and triangulation maintained.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "- Node positions: node_1 (0,0) pinned, node_2 (6,0) roller fixed.
