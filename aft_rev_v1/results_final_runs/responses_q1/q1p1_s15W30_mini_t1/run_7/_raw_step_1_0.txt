The goal is to generate a closed 2D truss that meets all stress and mass constraints with minimal mass.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Initial: Load of -10 N at node_3 downward-left (45°), supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current max stress at member_2 (-16.12) beyond allowable ±15. Mass 16.3 < 30 allowed. Structure not closed; only 5 members connecting 4 nodes. Need closed truss structure for stability and stress reduction.",\n\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 pulls down-left causing high compressive stress in member_2 (node_3-node_2). Current structure forms a trapezoid plus a diagonal (node_3-node_4). Supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller restrain vertical and horizontal. Current design lacks sufficient triangulation around the loaded node, causing stress concentration. Members have mixed cross sections with some very small area (member_2 is \'1\' area) leading to overstress there. The structure is partially triangulated but likely unstable under lateral component of load at node_3. Mass is in limits but risk high stress.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Insight: To reduce max stress, enhance triangulation and redistribute load paths. Adding a lower chord member between node_1 and node_2 closes the bottom, creating a full closed frame. Adding a diagonal from node_4 to node_2 or node_1 helps reduce bending and distribute loads better. Increasing area of members under compression critical (e.g. member_2) reduces stress. Position of node_3 along bottom chord can be adjusted to improve force distribution without moving supported or loaded nodes. All nodes connected with minimal geometry changes.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign as a closed trapezoidal truss with four nodes same as before. Add bottom chord (node_1-node_2). Keep existing diagonals from node_3 to nodes 1 and 2, and node_4 to nodes 1 and 2. This closes the polygon and increases triangulation. Optimize member cross sections to limit stress below ±15, with slightly increased area for members now carrying more load. Keep node_3 and supports fixed as required.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Closed polygon shape with triangulation minimizes bending and spreads axial forces. Adding bottom chord reduces member_2\'s compressive stress. Members on diagonals carry tension/compression effectively. distribute area sizes by assigning larger sections to highly stressed members. Node_4 at (2.0,3.0) remains to help distribute vertical loads from node_3. Node_3 at (2.0,0.0). Node_1 at origin. Node_2 at (6.0,0.0). Keep all nodes fixed except no repositioning of loaded/support nodes. Members: bottom chord (node_1-node_2), two diagonals at base (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2), uprights (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4), diagonals top (node_4-node_3). Take advantage of symmetry and node fixity for load flow.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic axial members, axial force = load component along member direction, stress = force/area, mass = length * area (density normalized). Calculate member lengths using distance formula. Assign larger areas (area_id \'3\' or \'4\') to members with higher expected compression/tension (notably member_2 and side supports). Estimate forces via static equilibrium considering nodal forces. Check max stress ≤ ±15 constraint and total mass ≤ 30 (length × area sum). Adjust areas accordingly and verify equilibrium. Members selected from available area_id keys, no fractional areas.",\n\n    "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1(0.0,0.0), node_2(6.0,0.0), node_3(2.0,0.0), node_4(2.0,3.0).

Calculate masses: sum length×area=2×1.759 +4×3.128 +3×1.759 +3.6056×1.759 +6×0.782 = ~21.5 (within 30).
