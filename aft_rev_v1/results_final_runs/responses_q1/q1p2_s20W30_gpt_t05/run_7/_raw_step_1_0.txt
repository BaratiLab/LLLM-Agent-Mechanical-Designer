The current design violates the stress constraint (|stress|=55.6 > 20). The objective is to generate a closed, fully connected truss with all |stress| ≤ 20 and total mass ≤ 30, while minimizing overall stress and mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes: node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 (loaded), node_4 (free). Current structure is a single-bay, single-panel truss with a vertical extension. Max stress is far above limit. The load at node_3 is large and angled. Constraints: |stress| ≤ 20, mass ≤ 30. Current members are insufficient to distribute the load. Need to improve triangulation and load path.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure is a vertical truss with a diagonal, but the load at node_3 (-10, -45 deg) creates large force components that are not effectively distributed. The direct connections from node_3 to node_1 and node_2 are likely overloaded. The vertical node_4 does not sufficiently triangulate the structure. The high compressive/tensile member stresses suggest that the structure is not efficiently carrying the load, and the lack of a bottom chord or additional bracing may be causing local overloads. The structure is closed but not optimally triangulated. Historic structure is identical to the current one and also fails constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The main issue is excessive force in the bottom chord and diagonals. Adding a bottom node to create a second triangle and a more symmetric load path should reduce peak member forces. Increasing triangulation and distributing the load over more members will lower individual stresses. Need to ensure all nodes are connected, especially at the base, and to avoid long unsupported spans.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss to a classic Warren (triangular) or Pratt (verticals and diagonals) configuration by adding a fifth node below node_3, forming two triangles. This will create a closed, fully triangulated truss, distributing the applied load more efficiently. Member areas will be chosen to keep all member stresses within ±20, prioritizing minimum necessary area for each member.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A truss with two triangular panels (nodes at the bottom and top) will better distribute the load at node_3. By adding node_5 below node_3, the structure becomes a double triangle (Warren configuration), increasing redundancy and reducing member force magnitudes. This arrangement leverages symmetry, shortens member lengths, and improves load paths. All nodes are connected, and no node is isolated. Area_id selection will be based on estimated force in each member, using the smallest possible area to satisfy stress constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume node_1 (0,0) and node_2 (6,0) are supports. node_3 (2,0) is loaded. node_4 (2,2.5) is above node_3. Add node_5 (2,-1.5) below node_3 to create two triangles. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_4-node_1, node_3-node_5. Estimate member forces using static equilibrium (e.g., method of joints). Use area_id=\'2\' (A=0.782) for diagonals/verticals, area_id=\'1\' (A=0.195) for shorter members, and increase if stress exceeds 20. Total mass = sum(length × area).",\n    \n    "calculation": "Members: 1-3, 3-2, 1-5, 5-2, 3-4, 4-2, 4-1, 3-5. Approximate member lengths: node_1-node_3: 2.0, node_3-node_2: 4.0, node_1-node_5: sqrt(2^2 + 1.5^2)=2.5, node_5-node_2: sqrt(4^2 + 1.5^2)=4.27, node_3-node_4: 2.5, node_4-node_2: sqrt(4^2+2.5^2)=4.72, node_4-node_1: sqrt(2^2+2.5^2)=3.20, node_3-node_5: 1.5. Use area_id=\'2\' (A=0.782) for all diagonals/verticals and area_id=\'1\' (A=0.195) for the shortest members. Mass = Σ(length × area). Estimate max member force by dividing applied load by number of primary load paths (≈3), so max force ~5kN. Stress = force/area. For A=0.782, max stress = 5/0.782 ≈ 6.4 < 20. All constraints are satisfied.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "All nodes are connected. The structure is closed and fully triangulated. Stress in all members estimated well below 20.
