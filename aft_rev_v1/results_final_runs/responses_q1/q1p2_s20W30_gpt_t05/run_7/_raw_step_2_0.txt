The current and historic designs violate the stress constraint, especially in tension/compression at member_1. The objective is to generate a closed truss that meets all constraints and is as lightweight as possible.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The current structure has max(abs(stress)) = 26.21 (> 20), so it violates the stress constraint. The total mass is 15.786 (< 30), which is acceptable. Previous historic structures also violate the stress constraint. The load at node_3 (-10kN @ -45°) creates significant moments and requires efficient load paths to supports. All nodes must be interconnected for closure.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current structure forms a closed truss with a central vertical (node_3) and two extra nodes above and below (node_4, node_5). However, member_1 (node_1 to node_3) is overstressed in compression. The load at node_3 is significant and off-axis, requiring robust triangulation to distribute forces efficiently to both supports. The current member layout may not provide optimal force distribution, especially near node_3. Members connected to node_3 are likely undersized or not ideally oriented for the diagonal load. Historic structures with fewer nodes perform worse. The mass constraint is not limiting, so increasing member areas or adding redundancy is feasible.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key insight: The diagonal load at node_3 induces high axial forces along members 1 and 2. The current truss geometry leads to high force concentration. Improving triangulation and possibly increasing the cross-sectional area of overstressed members should reduce peak stresses. Additional bracing or a slight repositioning of node_4 and node_5 to optimize force angles may help. The structure should remain closed and all nodes connected.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss by (1) increasing the areas for overstressed members (especially member_1), (2) slightly adjusting the positions of node_4 and node_5 to form more optimal triangles (moving them outward to widen the truss and reduce force magnitudes), and (3) adding a diagonal member from node_5 to node_4 for further triangulation and load path redundancy. This should reduce force concentrations and keep stresses within constraints without significantly increasing mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By widening node_4 and node_5 horizontally, the force angles from the loaded node_3 to supports are improved, reducing axial forces in members. Increasing the area of highly stressed members (using area_id \'3\' for member_1, which is 1.759, up from 0.782) directly reduces stress. Adding a diagonal member between node_4 and node_5 increases redundancy and distributes the load more efficiently. All nodes remain structurally connected, and the structure is closed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Statically determinate truss, all joints pinned, only axial forces. Use trigonometry for force distribution. For member_1 (node_1-node_3), increase area to \'3\' (1.759) for stress reduction. Move node_4 to (2.0, 3.0) and node_5 to (2.0, -2.0) to increase vertical separation and reduce angles. Add member_9: node_4 to node_5. Recalculate member lengths, forces, and mass. Check that all member stresses < 20 and mass < 30.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member_1 (node_1-node_3): length = 2.0, area = 1.759. Max force previously ~-26.2, so new stress = -26.2 * (0.782/1.759) ≈ -11.65 (well within ±20). Members from node_3 to node_4 and node_5 are also checked; area \'2\' (0.782) is sufficient as previous max stress was ~10. All other members remain with area \'2\'. New member_9 (node_4-node_5) is 5.0 units long, area \'1\' (0.195) as it mainly stabilizes the structure. Total mass: sum(length × area) ≈ (2.0×1.759)+(4.0×0.782)+(4.5×0.782)+(5.0×0.195)+(4.0×0.782)+(4.5×0.782)+(4.0×0.782)+(4.5×0.782)+(5.0×0.195) ≈ 3.518+3.128+3.519+0.975+3.128+3.519+3.128+3.519+0.975 ≈ 25.41 < 30.
