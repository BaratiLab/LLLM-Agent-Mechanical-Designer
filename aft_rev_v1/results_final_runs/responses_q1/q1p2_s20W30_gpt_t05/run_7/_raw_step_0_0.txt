The objective is to minimize member stress (|stress| ≤ 20) and total mass (≤ 30), using only the provided cross-sectional area options and without moving the given support/load node positions.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three collinear nodes at (0,0), (2,0), and (6,0), with a downward-left load at node_3, and supports at nodes 1 and 2. To form a closed, triangulated structure (all nodes connected), additional node(s) must be introduced off the x-axis to provide vertical and lateral stability and efficient force distribution.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current node placement is collinear, which cannot resist vertical loads or form a closed truss. A single triangle formed by adding a node above the x-axis (e.g., above node_3) will allow triangulation and effective load transfer. The load at node_3 (-10, -45°) creates both vertical and horizontal components. The pinned support at node_1 and roller at node_2 allow for proper constraint. Members should be sized to keep stress < 20, and total mass low. Symmetry and direct load paths are key.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation is mandatory for stability. Placing a new node above the x-axis and connecting all nodes forms two triangles. The new node should be positioned to minimize member lengths and allow efficient force transfer from node_3 to supports.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (2,2.5), above node_3, to form two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4). Connect all nodes to ensure closure. This keeps the structure light, shortens member lengths, and provides effective load paths. Use minimum areas for short/compression members, and increase area for members expected to see high stress (e.g., those connecting to node_3).",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume steel-like material (unit stress/area for estimation). Compute load at node_3: Fx = -10*cos(45°) ≈ -7.07, Fy = -7.07. Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_2-node_3 = 4.0, node_3-node_4 = 2.5, node_1-node_4 ≈ 3.20, node_2-node_4 ≈ 4.27. Assign area_id \'1\' (0.195) for compression members and \'2\' (0.782) for higher-stress members. Calculate forces via method of joints, check stress = force/area, and total mass = Σ(length × area). Iterate as needed to satisfy constraints.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member list: (1-3), (3-2), (3-4), (4-1), (4-2). Estimate force in (3-4) as primary load path (vertical + horizontal), so area_id \'2\' (0.782). Other members can use area_id \'1\' (0.195) or \'2\' if stresses are high. Compute mass: (1-3):2.0×0.195=0.39, (3-2):4.0×0.195=0.78, (3-4):2.5×0.782=1.96, (4-1):3.20×0.195=0.62, (4-2):4.27×0.195=0.83. Total mass ≈ 4.58 < 30.
