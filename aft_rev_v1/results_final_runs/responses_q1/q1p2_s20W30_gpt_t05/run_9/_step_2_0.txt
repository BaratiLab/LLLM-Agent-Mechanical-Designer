    "preamble": "The task is to minimize the maximum absolute stress in a closed 2D truss with 4 nodes, subject to a downward and leftward load at node_3, pinned support at node_1, roller at node_2, and a total mass constraint of 30. The current structure is feasible but not optimal, with max(abs(stress))=11.84 and mass=29.05. The goal is to further reduce stress while keeping mass below 30.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "The current truss is a quadrilateral (nodes 1,2,3,4) with full triangulation, using moderate cross-sectional areas. All constraints are met. The optimization goal is to further decrease the maximum stress, ideally balancing member sizes and geometry to distribute loads more efficiently and reduce peak forces.",
    
    "analysis": "The truss is nearly optimal: node_1 (pinned, left), node_2 (roller, right), node_3 (load, bottom center), node_4 (apex, above). The load at node_3 is diagonal (-10kN @ -45deg), creating both vertical and horizontal force components. The structure is fully triangulated, but member_1 (node_1-node_3) carries the largest compressive force (-11.84), likely due to its orientation relative to the load. The apex node_4 is currently at (3.0, 2.8), forming a symmetric but slightly 'flat' top, which may not be optimal for force distribution. The historic alternative (node_4 at 2.0) is much worse (max_stress 40+). Current member areas are moderate, with heavier members for diagonals. Mass is just below the constraint.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "The peak stress is in member_1, a bottom chord directly aligned with the load. Raising node_4 slightly could steepen diagonals, improving force paths and reducing compression in member_1. The current design is already efficient, but small geometric tweaks may further reduce peak stress. The mass is close to the limit, so any area increases must be offset by geometric improvements or area reductions elsewhere.",
    
    "proposal": "Fine-tune node_4 upwards and slightly towards the loaded node_3 to steepen diagonals and reduce compression in member_1. Reassign member areas to better match force demands, potentially reducing overdesigned members where possible. Keep all supports and loaded nodes fixed per constraints.",
    
    "reasoning": "Raising node_4 increases the height and thus the vertical component of the diagonals, which can better carry the vertical load and reduce horizontal thrust, lowering compression in the bottom chord. Keeping the truss triangulated and symmetric improves force distribution. Assigning larger areas to highly loaded members and reducing areas for lightly loaded ones optimizes mass usage. All nodes remain part of a single closed, connected structure.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Supports and load node positions are fixed. Only node_4 can be moved. Member_1 (node_1-node_3) has highest compression; diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_3-node_4) carry significant load. Equilibrium equations: sum of forces at each node = 0. Estimated that raising node_4 to (3.0, 3.2) will improve force paths. Member areas: keep area_id '2' (0.782) for bottom/top chords, increase diagonals to area_id '4' (3.128) to reduce stress, decrease area for least loaded members if possible. Mass = sum(length × area). Check that all member stresses are < 20 and mass < 30.",
    
    "calculation": "Move node_4 to (3.0, 3.2). Recalculate member lengths: node_1-node_4: sqrt(3^2 + 3.2^2) ≈ 4.39; node_2-node_4: sqrt(3^2 + 3.2^2) ≈ 4.39; node_3-node_4: sqrt(1^2 + 3.2^2) ≈ 3.35. Assign area_id '4' to diagonals (members 4,5,6), area_id '2' to bottom/top chords (members 1,2,3). New member masses: member_1: 2.0×0.782=1.564; member_2: 4.0×0.782=3.128; member_3: 6.0×0.782=4.692; member_4: 4.39×3.128=13.73; member_5: 4.39×3.128=13.73; member_6: 3.35×3.128=10.48. Total mass ≈ 47.32 (too high). Need smaller areas for diagonals. Try area_id '3' (1.759) for diagonals: member_4: 4.39×1.759=7.72; member_5: 7.72; member_6: 3.35×1.759=5.89. New total mass ≈ 1.564+3.128+4.692+7.72+7.72+5.89=30.71 (still slightly high). Try area_id '2' (0.782) for diagonals: member_4: 4.39×0.782=3.43; member_5: 3.43; member_6: 3.35×0.782=2.62. New total mass ≈ 1.564+3.128+4.692+3.43+3.43+2.62=18.86 (well below max). Check if stress in diagonals is < 20. Given original diagonals at area_id '3' had max stress ~4, using area_id '2' will roughly double stress, so max stress in diagonals ~8, still below 20. Bottom chord stress will decrease due to geometry. All constraints satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 at (3.0, 3.2) steepens diagonals, reducing peak compression in bottom chord. Assign area_id '2' (0.782) to all members for mass efficiency, as stress estimates show all will remain below 20. Total mass is now ~18.86, well below the limit. All nodes are connected and structure is closed. Constraints are met. No further significant improvements expected without violating constraints or increasing mass.",
