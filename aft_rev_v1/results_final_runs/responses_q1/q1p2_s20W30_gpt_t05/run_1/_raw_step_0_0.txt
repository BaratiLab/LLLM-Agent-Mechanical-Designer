Objective: minimize member stress (|stress| ≤ 20), ensure total mass ≤ 30, and create a closed, triangulated structure using only allowed area IDs. All nodes must be connected in a single closed truss.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three collinear nodes, direct connection forms a degenerate (open) truss. To create a closed, triangulated truss, introduce a fourth node above the base line, forming two triangles. The load at node_3 is at -45°, so optimal placement is above node_3 to provide vertical and horizontal load paths. All members must be checked for stress and mass constraints.",\n    \n    "analysis": "With only three collinear nodes, a triangle cannot be formed. Adding a node (node_4) above node_3 at (2.0, h) creates two stable triangles: (node_1, node_2, node_4) and (node_1, node_3, node_4). Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) will provide stability, and triangulation will distribute the -10 kN load efficiently. Members must be sized to keep stresses ≤ 20, and total mass ≤ 30. The load at node_3 is best transferred through node_4 to both supports.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Placing node_4 at (2.0, 2.5) (above node_3) forms two triangles, shortens member lengths, and provides vertical height for force distribution. This location balances between a shallow and steep truss, limiting both member forces and mass. All nodes are now part of a single closed structure. Members: (node_1-node_2), (node_2-node_4), (node_4-node_1), (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_4).",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation is essential for stability. The new node_4 at (2.0, 2.5) is chosen for symmetry and efficient load transfer. Members are selected to minimize length (mass) while ensuring direct load paths from node_3 to both supports. Area IDs are assigned based on estimated member forces: higher for loaded members, minimal for lightly loaded ones. This configuration ensures all nodes are connected, forming a closed, efficient truss.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume all members are pin-connected. Estimate member forces using static equilibrium (joints method). Calculate member lengths using distance formula. Assign area IDs to keep max |stress| ≤ 20. Mass = sum(length × area). Select minimal area IDs that satisfy stress constraint for each member. For initial sizing, use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for diagonals, \'1\' (0.195) for less loaded, adjust if stress > 20. Check total mass.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_2 = 6.0; node_1-node_4 = sqrt((2-0)^2 + (2.5-0)^2) ≈ 3.20; node_2-node_4 = sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-2.5)^2) ≈ 4.72; node_1-node_3 = 2.0; node_3-node_4 = 2.5.

Estimate worst-case member force in diagonals ≈ 10 kN; stress = F/A = 10/0.782 ≈ 12.8 < 20. Mass = (6.0×0.195) + (3.20×0.782) + (4.72×0.782) + (2.0×0.195) + (2.5×0.782) ≈ 1.17 + 2.50 + 3.69 + 0.39 + 1.96 = 9.71 < 30.
