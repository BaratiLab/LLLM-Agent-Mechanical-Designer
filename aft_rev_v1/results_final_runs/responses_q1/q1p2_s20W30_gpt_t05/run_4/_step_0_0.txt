    "preamble": "Design a minimal-mass, closed 2D truss using three fixed nodes, one load, and two supports, optimizing member areas and geometry to ensure all member stresses are within ±20 and total mass ≤ 30. The structure must be fully connected and statically determinate or slightly indeterminate for redundancy.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes form a line (0,0)-(2,0)-(6,0). Load of 10 units at node_3 (2,0) at -45°, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Need to form a closed, triangulated truss, likely adding at least one node above the x-axis for geometric stability. Must select member areas from discrete set, minimize mass, and ensure stress ≤ 20.",
    
    "analysis": "With all nodes collinear, any truss using only these would be unstable. Adding an upper node (say, node_4 above node_3) enables triangulation. The direct load on node_3 requires strong members to both supports. Triangulation distributes force efficiently. Members from node_3 to node_4, and node_4 to supports, create triangles. Failure modes: excessive stress in members adjacent to node_3, collapse if insufficient triangulation. Efficient structure: two triangles sharing base (node_1-node_2-node_3-node_4).",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Key insight: place node_4 above node_3, at (2.0, h). Select h to balance geometry (not too tall to avoid long, heavy members, not too low to avoid shallow angles and high forces). Try h ≈ 2.0 for a moderate rise. Ensure all three original nodes are included and closed triangles formed. Members: (1-3), (3-2), (2-4), (4-1), (3-4).",
    
    "reasoning": "Triangulation is essential for stability and stress reduction. Placing node_4 at (2.0, 2.0) forms two triangles: (1-3-4) and (2-3-4). This geometry spreads the load from node_3 efficiently to both supports and avoids long, inefficient members. Choose minimal member areas that keep stress < 20, prioritizing larger areas for members directly loaded (e.g., those connected to node_3).",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume node_4 at (2.0, 2.0). Members: (1-3), (3-2), (3-4), (4-2), (4-1). Calculate member lengths, estimate forces via joint equilibrium (focus on node_3 with applied load). For mass: sum(length × area). For stress: force/area. Start with area_id '2' (0.782) for most, increase for most-loaded members if needed. Check total mass and max stress.",
    
    "calculation": "Member lengths: (1-3): 2.0, (3-2): 4.0, (3-4): 2.0, (4-2): sqrt((4)^2 + (2)^2) ≈ 4.47, (4-1): sqrt((2)^2 + (2)^2) ≈ 2.83. Assume primary load at node_3 splits into (3-1), (3-2), (3-4). Estimate major force in (3-4), then (4-2), (4-1). Assign area_id '4' (3.128) to (3-4), '2' (0.782) to others. Mass: 2.0×0.782 + 4.0×0.782 + 2.0×3.128 + 4.47×0.782 + 2.83×0.782 ≈ 1.56 + 3.13 + 6.26 + 3.50 + 2.21 = 16.66 < 30. Estimated max force in (3-4) ≈ 10/√2 ≈ 7.07, stress = 7.07/3.128 ≈ 2.26 < 20. All other members: stress < 20. All constraints satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "All nodes are unique, all members connect unique pairs, no duplicates. Structure is closed and triangulated. All member stresses well below 20. Total mass ≈ 16.66, well under 30. Node_4 placed at (2.0, 2.0) for efficient force distribution. All instructions and constraints met.",
