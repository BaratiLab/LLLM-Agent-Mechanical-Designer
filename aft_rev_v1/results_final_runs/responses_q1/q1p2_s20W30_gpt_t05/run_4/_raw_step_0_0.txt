The structure must be fully connected and statically determinate or slightly indeterminate for redundancy.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes form a line (0,0)-(2,0)-(6,0). Load of 10 units at node_3 (2,0) at -45°, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Need to form a closed, triangulated truss, likely adding at least one node above the x-axis for geometric stability. Must select member areas from discrete set, minimize mass, and ensure stress ≤ 20.",\n    \n    "analysis": "With all nodes collinear, any truss using only these would be unstable. Adding an upper node (say, node_4 above node_3) enables triangulation. The direct load on node_3 requires strong members to both supports. Triangulation distributes force efficiently. Members from node_3 to node_4, and node_4 to supports, create triangles. Failure modes: excessive stress in members adjacent to node_3, collapse if insufficient triangulation. Efficient structure: two triangles sharing base (node_1-node_2-node_3-node_4).",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key insight: place node_4 above node_3, at (2.0, h). Select h to balance geometry (not too tall to avoid long, heavy members, not too low to avoid shallow angles and high forces). Try h ≈ 2.0 for a moderate rise. Ensure all three original nodes are included and closed triangles formed. Members: (1-3), (3-2), (2-4), (4-1), (3-4).",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation is essential for stability and stress reduction. Placing node_4 at (2.0, 2.0) forms two triangles: (1-3-4) and (2-3-4). This geometry spreads the load from node_3 efficiently to both supports and avoids long, inefficient members. Choose minimal member areas that keep stress < 20, prioritizing larger areas for members directly loaded (e.g., those connected to node_3).",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume node_4 at (2.0, 2.0). Members: (1-3), (3-2), (3-4), (4-2), (4-1). Calculate member lengths, estimate forces via joint equilibrium (focus on node_3 with applied load). For mass: sum(length × area). For stress: force/area.

Mass: 2.0×0.782 + 4.0×0.782 + 2.0×3.128 + 4.47×0.782 + 2.83×0.782 ≈ 1.56 + 3.13 + 6.26 + 3.50 + 2.21 = 16.66 < 30. Estimated max force in (3-4) ≈ 10/√2 ≈ 7.07, stress = 7.07/3.128 ≈ 2.26 < 20.
