    "preamble": "The task is to minimize the maximum absolute member stress in a closed 2D truss with four nodes and five members, while keeping the total mass under 30 and all stresses within ±20. The current structure already satisfies all constraints, but has a max(abs(stress)) of 15.07 and total mass of 16.657. The optimization objective is to further reduce stress, if possible, without increasing mass or violating constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs are clear: nodes 1 and 2 are supported (pinned, roller), node 3 carries a -10kN load at -45°, and node 4 is free. All nodes are in a rectangular arrangement with a vertical extension at node 4. Member areas are moderate, with some members possibly oversized. The structure is closed and constraints are currently satisfied.",
    
    "analysis": "The current truss is a closed quadrilateral with a diagonal (node_3 to node_4) and all members connected. The highest stress is -15.07 (compression in member_1), well within the ±20 limit. The mass is well below the 30 unit cap. There is some inefficiency: member_3 (node_3-node_4) is very large (area_id=4, area=3.128), but carries only -2.26 stress, suggesting possible overdesign. The other members are mostly at area_id=2 (area=0.782). The load at node_3 is transferred through the diagonal and the adjacent horizontal members. The use of a vertical at node_4 (2,2) is structurally sensible for triangulation, but the area assignments could be better balanced.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Stress is highest in member_1 (node_1-node_3), which is in compression. The diagonal (member_3) is lightly loaded but heavily sized. There is an opportunity to reduce the area of member_3 and perhaps slightly increase the area of member_1 to balance stress and mass. Also, the current configuration is close to optimal, but fine-tuning member areas could yield a lower max stress-to-weight ratio.",
    
    "proposal": "Keep the current node layout (since supports and load nodes cannot move). Optimize by reducing the area of the lightly loaded member_3 (diagonal), and increasing the area of member_1 (which has the highest stress), while keeping other members at area_id=2 or slightly adjusting them to balance stresses. This will reduce unnecessary mass and may slightly reduce the maximum stress.",
    
    "reasoning": "By using the minimum area required for lightly loaded members and increasing the area of highly stressed members, the structure will be more efficient. Member_1 will be upsized to area_id=3 (area=1.759) to reduce its compressive stress, while member_3 will be downsized to area_id=2 (area=0.782) since its stress is low. Other members will remain at area_id=2 (area=0.782) as their stresses are moderate and within safe limits. No node movement is possible for supports or loaded nodes; node_4 remains as is to keep the structure closed and triangulated.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Key assumptions: Member_1 (highest stress) gets a larger area to reduce stress. Member_3 (lowest stress) gets a smaller area to reduce mass. Mass = sum(length × area). Stress = force / area. With these changes, member_1's stress should drop below 10, member_3's stress will rise but remain far below the limit, and total mass will decrease. No geometry changes, so lengths remain constant. All constraints will still be satisfied.",
    
    "calculation": "Member_1: length = 2.0, new area = 1.759, new stress = old_force / 1.759 ≈ -6.7. Member_3: length = 2.0, new area = 0.782, new stress = old_force / 0.782 ≈ -2.89. Other members unchanged: member_2 (length=4.0), member_4 (length≈4.472), member_5 (length≈2.828), all at area=0.782. New mass: member_1: 2.0×1.759=3.518, member_2: 4.0×0.782=3.128, member_3: 2.0×0.782=1.564, member_4: 4.472×0.782=3.497, member_5: 2.828×0.782=2.212. Total ≈ 13.919. All stresses are now well below 20. Constraints are satisfied and the structure is lighter and more efficient.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "All changes are area-based, not geometric. Node positions are fixed for supports and loads, and node_4 remains at (2.0,2.0) for triangulation. Members are all connected, no isolated nodes. All constraints satisfied: max(abs(stress)) < 10, mass ≈ 13.92 < 30. The design is now more efficient and close to optimal for this topology and load case.",
    
    "stop": "True",  # The structure is now lighter, all stresses are well below the limit, and further improvement would require topology changes not justified by the load/support geometry. This is likely optimal for the given constraints.
