The current and historic designs violate the max stress constraint (|stress| ≤ 20) and, in some cases, are mass-inefficient. The goal is to propose a feasible, efficient truss with precise geometry and member sizing, ensuring all nodes are connected and all constraints are satisfied.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: Minimize max(abs(stress)) ≤ 20 and total mass ≤ 30, using only allowed area_id values. Supports and load node positions are fixed. The truss must be closed and efficient. Current and historic structures are either over-stressed or overly heavy.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current structure is a simple quadrilateral with a vertical node_4 above node_3, forming two triangles. Loads on node_3 (-10kN at -45°) induce significant tension/compression in members connected to node_3 and node_4. The highest stress (27.84) is in member_4 (node_1-node_4), exceeding the constraint. Increasing member areas reduces stress but increases mass. Previous attempts to thicken only certain members resulted in overdesign (mass > 30) or underdesign (stress > 20). The structure is not optimally triangulated for load transfer from node_3 to the supports.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key issue: The diagonal load at node_3 is not efficiently transferred to the supports; the member between node_1 and node_4 is over-stressed. The core triangle (node_1, node_2, node_4) is too \'tall\', amplifying force in vertical members. Adding a new node or optimizing node_4\'s position could improve force distribution. Adding a lower chord (node_1-node_3-node_2) with a mid-height node could reduce member forces.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss by lowering node_4 to (2.0, 2.2) to reduce vertical member length and stress, and add a new top chord node_5 at (4.0, 2.2) to create two smaller triangles above the base. This will improve triangulation and distribute the load from node_3 more efficiently. Member areas will be selected to keep all stresses ≤ 20 while minimizing total mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation is essential for 2D truss efficiency. By lowering node_4 and adding node_5, the structure forms two triangles above the base, reducing the lever arm for vertical loads and distributing the load from node_3 to both supports. This should significantly reduce peak stress in any single member. Members will be sized based on expected force paths: diagonals and verticals likely need larger area than base members.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All joints are pinned, loads are static, and self-weight is negligible compared to applied load. Key equations: For each member, stress = force / area; mass = length × area. Estimate member forces using static equilibrium (method of joints). Use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for diagonals and verticals, \'1\' (0.195) for base members, increasing as needed to keep stress ≤ 20. New node_4 at (2.0, 2.2) and node_5 at (4.0, 2.2) create a compact, triangulated upper chord.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Base: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0). Top: node_4 (2.0,2.2), node_5 (4.0,2.2). Members: node_1-node_2 (base), node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_3-node_5, node_4-node_5, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_5. Estimate: The load at node_3 splits between node_4 and node_5, reducing force in any one member. Assign area_id \'2\' (0.782) for diagonals and verticals, \'1\' (0.195) for base, increase to \'3\' (1.759) if stress exceeds 20.
