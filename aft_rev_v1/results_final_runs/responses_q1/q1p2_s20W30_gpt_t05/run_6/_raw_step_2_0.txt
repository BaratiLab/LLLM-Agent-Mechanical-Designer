The previous designs exceeded the mass constraint and/or stress limits. The goal is to minimize both while ensuring structural closure and efficiency.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The initial design connects all four nodes, but the total mass (38.6) exceeds the 30-unit limit, and the maximum member stress (8.04) is within the stress constraint. However, some members are oversized for their force, causing excess mass. The structure is closed and triangulated, but not mass-optimal.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Supports are at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). A -10kN force at node_3 acts at -45°, inducing both downward and leftward components. The current truss is a quadrilateral with diagonals, forming two triangles. The history shows that reducing member areas too much (as in constraint_not_met_2) causes stress to exceed the limit. The current issue is excess mass, not overstressing. Members 3, 4, 5, and 6 are particularly heavy, indicating that their cross-sectional areas are larger than required for the actual forces they carry. The load path suggests that the force at node_3 is shared between members connecting to node_4 and node_1, with node_4 acting as a top chord to distribute loads. The structure is stable and statically determinate.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Most members are not highly stressed (max: -8.04 vs. limit 20), so their areas can be reduced without exceeding the stress constraint. The mass is dominated by members with large area IDs (notably member_3 with area_id 6, and members 4, 5, 6 with area_id 3). Insight: By matching member areas more closely to their actual force, mass can be reduced. The geometry is reasonable, but member sizing is the main inefficiency.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Keep the current node layout and connectivity (as it is already closed and efficient), but resize members to use the smallest area that keeps their absolute stress below 20. This minimizes mass while satisfying the stress constraint. No new nodes or major geometry changes are needed, as the triangles are efficient for this load case. Each member\'s area will be recalculated based on its force.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "The structure is already triangulated and closed, which is optimal for stability. The main inefficiency is in member sizing. By calculating the required area for each member (using σ = F/A), and selecting the smallest available area_id that keeps |σ| ≤ 20, we ensure all constraints are met. This approach leverages the existing efficient geometry, focusing on mass optimization through member selection.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic behavior, all members in axial force only, no buckling for compression members at these lengths/areas. Use member_stress from the FEM results as the force per unit area (σ = F/A), so F = σ*A. For each member, required area = |F|/20 (since |σ| ≤ 20). Use the next available area_id above this value from area_id dict. Calculate mass as sum of (length × area). Node positions are unchanged as they are efficient for this load case and boundary conditions.",\n    \n    "calculation": "For each member:\\n- member_1: stress = -5.77, length = 6.0.
