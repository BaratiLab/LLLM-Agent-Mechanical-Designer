The current structure is over-stressed (max(abs(stress)) = 42.31) though mass is low (9.61). The objective is to redesign or modify the truss to satisfy all constraints while maintaining a closed, efficient load path.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The initial structure is a basic quadrilateral with diagonals, where node_3 (load node) is close to the supports and the top node (node_4) is centered. The largest stress is in member_3 (node_3–node_1), indicating an overloaded bottom chord under the applied load. The structure is light but not strong enough for the applied load.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The applied load at node_3 is -10 kN at -45°, producing both horizontal and vertical force components. Node_1 is pinned, node_2 is a roller; node_3 is between them, and node_4 is above. The current design forms a closed shape but the bottom chord (node_3–node_1, member_3) is over-stressed in compression. The diagonal load creates significant bending and axial forces, but the current triangulation does not distribute the load efficiently. The use of small area members (area_id \'1\' and \'2\') in high-stress locations leads to constraint violations.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key issues: The bottom chord is too slender for the compressive load. The upper node (node_4) is not optimally positioned for force distribution. The structure could benefit from better triangulation, possibly by moving node_4 upward or outward to reduce member forces, and by increasing the cross-sectional area of the most stressed members. The current mass constraint is not limiting, so heavier members can be used.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss by raising node_4 to increase the effective height (reducing axial forces in the chords), and increase the area of the bottom chord (member_3). Use larger area members for the most stressed members (bottom chord and diagonals). Keep node and support locations fixed as required. Maintain a closed, triangulated structure for stability.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By increasing the height of node_4, the vertical component of the load is better resisted by axial forces in the diagonals and chords, reducing the force in the bottom chord. Increasing the area of the bottom chord and diagonals will reduce stress below the constraint. Triangulation ensures stability and efficient force transfer. The mass constraint allows for heavier members where needed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Load at node_3 is -10 kN at -45°, giving Fx = -7.07 kN, Fy = -7.07 kN. Nodes 1 and 2 are supports; node_3 is between them. Propose new node_4 at (2.0, 3.5) to increase height. Use area_id \'6\' (7.037) for the bottom chord (member_3), area_id \'4\' (3.128) for diagonals, area_id \'1\' (0.195) for less stressed members. Calculate member lengths and masses. Check stress in critical members (bottom chord, diagonals) using basic statics: F = P/(sinθ), stress = F/area.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node_4 at (2.0, 3.5):\\n- Bottom chord (node_3–node_1): Length = 2.0 m, area = 7.037, mass = 2.0×7.037=14.07\\n- Diagonals (node_3–node_4, node_1–node_4): Length ≈ sqrt(0^2 + 3.5^2) = 3.5 m, area = 3.128, mass = 3.5×3.128=10.95 each\\n- Top chord (node_4–node_2): Length = sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-3.5)^2) = sqrt(16+12.25)=5.13 m, area = 0.195, mass = 1.00\\n- Side chords (node_1–node_2, node_2–node_3): lengths 6.0 m and 4.0 m, area = 0.195, mass = 1.17 and 0.78\\nTotal mass ≈ 14.07 + 10.95×2 + 1.00 + 1.17 + 0.78 = 38.92 (too high).
