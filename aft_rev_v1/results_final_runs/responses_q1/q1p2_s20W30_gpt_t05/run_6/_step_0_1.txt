    "preamble": "The task is to design a fully connected, closed 2D truss using three given nodes, subject to one load and two supports. The objectives are to minimize member stresses (within ±20) and total mass (≤30), choosing cross-sectional areas from a discrete set. The truss must be statically admissible and structurally efficient.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "We have three nodes in a line (0,0), (2,0), (6,0). Load of 10 at node_3 (2,0) at -45° (down and left). Supports: node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Need to connect all nodes in a closed (triangulated) fashion, possibly adding one node for closure and triangulation. Mass and stress constraints are tight; must select minimum sufficient area for each member.",
    
    "analysis": "With only three nodes on a straight line, a direct triangle is not possible without adding a new node. The load at node_3 will induce both vertical and horizontal reactions at supports. For closure and stability, introducing a fourth node above the line (forming a triangle) will efficiently distribute the load and minimize stress. Triangulation is essential for 2D truss stability. The most efficient configuration is a triangle with all nodes connected, and the fourth node placed above node_3 to create two triangles for direct load transfer and minimal bending.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a fourth node above node_3 (say at (2, 2.0)) creates two triangles: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_3-node_2-node_4. This allows direct load transfer from node_3 to both supports, reducing the likelihood of high compressive/tensile stresses and minimizing member lengths. Member sizes will be selected to keep all stresses within ±20, and total mass will be checked.",
    
    "reasoning": "By placing node_4 at (2, 2.0), we create two triangles, ensuring a closed and stable truss. Members from node_3 to node_4, node_1 to node_4, and node_2 to node_4 distribute the load efficiently. All nodes are included, and the structure is closed. The member from node_1 to node_2 provides the base, while node_3 to node_4 forms the vertical for the applied load. This configuration minimizes stress concentrations and total mass.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume node_4 at (2, 2.0). Members: (node_1-node_2), (node_2-node_3), (node_3-node_1), (node_1-node_4), (node_2-node_4), (node_3-node_4). Calculate lengths: node_1-node_2 = 6.0, node_2-node_3 = 4.0, node_3-node_1 = 2.0, node_1-node_4 = sqrt((2-0)^2 + (2-0)^2)=2.83, node_2-node_4 = sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-2)^2)=4.47, node_3-node_4 = 2.0. Assign minimum areas to each member, check maximum force (approximate by assuming worst-case load division), and increase area if stress exceeds ±20. Mass = sum(length × area).",
    
    "calculation": "Estimate forces: The vertical member (node_3-node_4) takes most of the vertical load. For 10 units at -45°, vertical and horizontal components are -7.07 each. Assume node_3-node_4 primarily handles vertical, node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4 take diagonal. Use area_id '2' (0.782) for diagonals and vertical, '1' (0.195) for base members. Compute stresses: force/area. For member node_3-node_4: ~7.07/0.782 = 9.05 (<20). For diagonals: force ~7.07/√2 = 5.0, stress = 5.0/0.782 = 6.39 (<20). Mass: (6.0+4.0+2.0)×0.195 + (2.83+4.47+2.0)×0.782 = 2.34 + 7.19 = 9.53 (<30). All constraints satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "All nodes are uniquely defined. All members connect unique pairs. Areas are chosen to keep stress below ±20. Total mass is well below 30. Structure is closed and triangulated. No constraint violations. Ready for output.",
