    "preamble": "The objective is to generate a closed, optimized 2D truss structure using four nodes (with pinned and roller supports at nodes 1 and 2, and a load at node 3) that minimizes maximum member stress (|stress| ≤ 20) and total mass (≤ 30), using only valid area IDs. The current design is over-stressed (max |stress| = 54.06), so a redesign is needed.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs: Four nodes. Supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller). Load at node 3: 10 kN at -45°. Areas from a discrete set. Current structure is a quadrilateral with a diagonal; max stress exceeds the limit. The structure is closed but not efficiently triangulated.",
    
    "analysis": "The current structure forms a quadrilateral (nodes 1-3-2-4-1) with one diagonal (3-4). The applied load at node 3 (-10 kN at -45°) is not optimally distributed: member 4-1 is over-stressed (54.06 > 20). There is insufficient triangulation, causing long, unbraced members to carry excessive force. The supports are well-placed for stability, but the geometry does not provide efficient load paths. History shows only this constraint-violating design.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Key issues: Over-stress in member 4-1 due to lack of triangulation and inefficient force distribution. To reduce stresses, the structure needs more triangulation (i.e., more triangles, fewer quadrilaterals). Node positions should be adjusted for more symmetric load sharing. Since supports and loaded node positions are fixed, move only node 4. Members must be sized to keep stress ≤ 20, but mass should be minimized.",
    
    "proposal": "Redesign the truss by repositioning node 4 and adding a diagonal from node 1 to node 2 to form two triangles. This will create a Warren truss-like structure, which is more efficient for the given load and support configuration. Use the smallest area IDs that satisfy the stress constraint. Keep nodes 1, 2, and 3 fixed; move node 4 upward and slightly left to optimize force angles.",
    
    "reasoning": "Triangulated trusses (Warren or Pratt) distribute loads more efficiently, reducing peak member forces. By moving node 4 vertically above the midspan (between nodes 1 and 2), we create two triangles and direct more of the applied load into axial forces rather than bending. Adding member 1-2 closes the structure, further improving force distribution. The diagonal from node 3 to node 4 helps transfer the load directly to the top chord. Select the minimum member areas that keep stress ≤ 20.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All members are pin-jointed, loaded only axially. Material strength is not limiting, only stress and mass. Equilibrium: sum of forces at each node = 0. Calculation steps: 1) Place node 4 at (3.0, 2.5) for symmetry and efficient load transfer. 2) Members: 1-3, 3-2, 2-4, 4-1, 3-4, 1-2. 3) Estimate member forces using static equilibrium (method of joints). 4) Compute required area for each member: area = |force| / 20. 5) Choose area_id ≥ required area from table. 6) Compute mass: sum(length × area).",
    
    "calculation": "With node 4 at (3.0, 2.5):\n\nMembers: 1-3, 3-2, 2-4, 4-1, 3-4, 1-2.\n\nApproximate member lengths:\n- 1-3: 2.00\n- 3-2: 4.00\n- 2-4: sqrt((6-3)^2 + (0-2.5)^2) ≈ 3.90\n- 4-1: sqrt((3-0)^2 + (2.5-0)^2) ≈ 3.90\n- 3-4: sqrt((3-2)^2 + (2.5-0)^2) ≈ 2.70\n- 1-2: 6.00\n\nEstimate force in most highly loaded member (likely diagonal or vertical under load):\n- Assume load at node 3 splits equally between 1-3 and 3-2 due to symmetry. Each gets about 7.07 kN (10/sqrt(2)).\n- For safety, size all members for 10 kN (conservative). Required area = 10/20 = 0.5. Use area_id '2' (0.782).\n\nMass per member = length × area:\n- 1-3: 2.00 × 0.782 = 1.564\n- 3-2: 4.00 × 0.782 = 3.128\n- 2-4: 3.90 × 0.782 ≈ 3.050\n- 4-1: 3.90 × 0.782 ≈ 3.050\n- 3-4: 2.70 × 0.782 ≈ 2.111\n- 1-2: 6.00 × 0.782 = 4.692\nTotal mass ≈ 17.60 (well under 30).\n\nAll members sized for ≤20 stress. Structure is now closed and triangulated.",
