    "preamble": "This task concerns the optimal design of a closed, fully connected 2D truss with three given nodes, subjected to a single oblique load and two distinct supports. The objective is to minimize member stress and total mass, ensuring no member exceeds ±20 stress and the structure's mass remains under 30 units.",

    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes are given: node_1 and node_2 at the base (pinned and roller supports), and node_3 at (2.0, 0.0) with a -10 kN load at -45°. The truss must be closed and all nodes connected. The challenge is to choose optimal member connections and cross-sectional areas to minimize stress and mass.",

    "analysis": "The geometry is nearly collinear, which is unstable for a truss. To achieve closure and triangulation, at least one new node (above the base) is required. The load at node_3 is downward and leftward, so an upper node (node_4) will help form two strong triangles. Members should connect all nodes: (node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4). The main load path is from node_3 to both supports, with node_4 redistributing forces. The supports provide vertical (node_1) and horizontal (node_1) plus vertical (node_2) reactions.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a node above the base (say, node_4 at (4.0, 2.0)) creates two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4). This improves stability, distributes the oblique load, and allows for smaller cross-sectional areas. Key members will be those directly carrying the load from node_3.",

    "reasoning": "Triangulation is essential for stability and efficient force distribution. Placing node_4 above the base (between node_1 and node_2) leverages symmetry and direct load paths. Members (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), (node_2-node_4), (node_4-node_1), (node_3-node_4) ensure closure and redundancy. Assign larger area to members directly under high stress, and smaller areas elsewhere.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume node_4 at (4.0, 2.0). Members: 1-3, 3-2, 2-4, 4-1, 3-4. Calculate member lengths, estimate forces using static equilibrium (joint method), and select area_id to keep stress under ±20. Calculate mass as sum(length × area). Adjust area_id up if stress is too high, down if over-conservative. Target minimal mass with all constraints met.",

    "calculation": "Member lengths: \n- 1-3: sqrt((2-0)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 2.00\n- 3-2: sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 4.00\n- 2-4: sqrt((6-4)^2 + (0-2)^2) = sqrt(4+4)=2.83\n- 4-1: sqrt((4-0)^2 + (2-0)^2)=sqrt(16+4)=4.47\n- 3-4: sqrt((4-2)^2 + (2-0)^2)=sqrt(4+4)=2.83\nEstimate: the largest forces are in 1-3, 3-2, and 3-4. Assign area_id '2' (0.782) to these, and area_id '1' (0.195) to less loaded members (2-4, 4-1). \nMass = (2.00+4.00+2.83)×0.782 + (2.83+4.47)×0.195 = (8.83×0.782)+(7.30×0.195) ≈ 6.90+1.42=8.32 < 30. \nCheck stress: For a 10kN load split between two triangles, each member sees ~7.1kN max. Stress = F/A = 7.1/0.782 ≈ 9.1 < 20. All constraints satisfied.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "Design meets closure, all nodes are connected, mass is well below the limit, and estimated stresses are under ±20. No duplicate nodes or members. Node_4 is placed for optimal triangulation and load path. All area_ids are chosen for efficiency.",
