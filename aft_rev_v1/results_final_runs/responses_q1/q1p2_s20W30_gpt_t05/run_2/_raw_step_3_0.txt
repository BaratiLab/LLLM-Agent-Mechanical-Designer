The current and past designs violate the max stress constraint (±20) and sometimes have excessive mass. The objective is to minimize stress and mass, ensuring all constraints are satisfied.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs: Load at node_3 (-10 kN at -45°), supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller). Current and historic structures have excessive member stresses (>400) and/or high mass (>14). Need to redesign for stress < 20 and mass < 30, using efficient triangulation and member sizing.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current and historic structures show high stress in members connected to node_3 and the top chord (members_3, 6, 7), due to poor load distribution and lack of optimized triangulation. The diagonal load at node_3 creates both vertical and horizontal components, requiring effective transfer to both supports. Historic attempts with more members reduced stress but at the cost of high mass. The current member sizing (area_id \'2\') is not sufficient for the high loads, and geometry does not optimize force paths. Efficient load transfer and triangulation are needed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key pattern: Stress is highest in members directly connecting to the loaded node and in long, unbraced members. The structure needs more direct load paths to supports and better triangulation. Adding a top node directly above node_3 and using a Warren truss configuration could help. Using larger area_id only where needed will minimize mass.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign structure as a Warren truss with an added top node above node_3 for triangulation, connecting all nodes to form a closed structure. Use minimal area where possible, increase area only for highly loaded members. Keep node_1, node_2, and node_3 fixed; add node_6 above node_3 for improved load path. Connect all nodes to ensure closure and redundancy.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Warren truss geometry efficiently distributes both diagonal and vertical load components, minimizing maximum member force. Placing a node above node_3 allows the diagonal load to be split between two triangles, reducing force in any one member. This geometry also reduces bending and provides direct load paths to both supports. Select area_id based on estimated member force, using higher area for diagonals from node_3 and lower for less loaded members.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: -10 kN load at -45° at node_3 splits into -7.07 kN (x) and -7.07 kN (y). With a top node (node_6) at (2.0, 2.5), triangles from node_3 to both supports and to node_6 share the load. Use statics to estimate member forces: diagonals from node_3 to node_1/node_2 will see the largest forces, so assign area_id \'4\' (A=3.128). Top chord and verticals can use smaller area. Estimate member lengths for mass calculation.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member layout: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_6 (2,2.5), node_4 (4,1.25), node_5 (0.5,1.25). Members: (1-3), (2-3), (1-6), (2-6), (3-6), (1-5), (5-6), (6-4), (4-2), (3-4), (5-3), (5-4). Assign higher area to (3-6), (3-1), (3-2), (6-2), rest smaller. Estimate max force in critical members ≈ load/2 ≈ 5 kN, so stress = 5/3.128 ≈ 1.6 << 20.
