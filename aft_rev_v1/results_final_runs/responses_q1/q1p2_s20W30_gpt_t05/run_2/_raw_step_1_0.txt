The current structure is overstressed (max|stress|=37.76), though mass is low (9.49). The objective is to redesign the truss to satisfy all constraints, minimizing max stress and mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given: 4 nodes, 6 members, 1 oblique load at node_3, pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Current design is overstressed, especially in member_5 (37.76). Objective: create a closed, constraint-satisfying truss with optimal member layout and cross-sections.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 is -10 kN at -45°, introducing both x and y components. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) provide stability. The current structure is a quadrilateral with diagonals, but member_5 (node_1-node_4) is highly overstressed, indicating poor load distribution. The overall geometry is not well triangulated, and members from node_3 to node_4 are likely underdesigned. The truss lacks efficient load paths from node_3 to supports, and the diagonal is too slender. All nodes are connected, so the structure is closed. Mass is well below the limit, so increasing member areas is feasible.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key issues: overstressed diagonal, inefficient triangulation between load and supports, possible need for extra bracing or area increases. Triangulation and direct load paths from node_3 to supports are critical. There is margin to increase member areas for stress reduction.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign by: (1) keeping node positions fixed for supports and load, (2) repositioning node_4 for better triangulation, (3) adding a fifth node above node_3 to create a more direct load path, (4) reassigning member areas to reduce stress, especially for the critical diagonal. The new structure will be a double triangle (Warren truss type) connecting node_3 to both supports via node_4 and a new node_5 above node_3.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A Warren-type truss efficiently distributes load, using triangles to avoid long, overstressed diagonals. By raising node_4 above node_3 and adding node_5 above node_3, the load at node_3 can be split between two triangles, reducing the force in any one member. Assigning larger areas to the most stressed members (based on load direction) will ensure all stresses are within ±20. Keeping mass low is possible by using smaller areas for less critical members.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: E = const, all joints are pin-connected, load is static. Key equations: For each member, stress = force / area; force found via method of joints (static equilibrium). Mass = sum(length × area). Place node_4 at (3.0, 3.5) and node_5 at (2.0, 2.5) to create two triangles: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_2-node_3-node_5. Use area_id \'4\' (3.128) for diagonals, \'2\' (0.782) for others. Estimate member forces using geometry and trigonometry (e.g., vertical and horizontal components).",\n    \n    "calculation": "Load at node_3: Fx = -10*cos(45°) = -7.07 kN, Fy = -10*sin(45°) = -7.07 kN. By creating two triangles, each diagonal will take about half the load. For diagonals (length ≈ 3.90 m), force ≈ 7.1 kN, so stress ≈ 7.1/3.128 ≈ 2.27 < 20. For shorter members (length ≈ 2.5 m), force < 7.1 kN, so stress ≈ 7.1/0.782 ≈ 9.08 < 20. Total mass: (2 × 3.9 × 3.128) + (4 × 2.5 × 0.782) ≈ 24.41, within constraint.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "All members are within ±20 stress, mass is below 30.
