Objective: minimize maximum member stress (|σ| ≤ 20) and total mass (≤ 30), using only allowed cross-sectional areas. Triangulation and direct load paths are critical to meet constraints under a downward-diagonal load.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes form a base (node_1, node_2) and a loaded node (node_3) between them. All must be connected. The load is significant and angled (-10, -45°), so direct paths to supports are needed. Triangulation will distribute forces and minimize peak stresses. Additional node(s) may help close the structure and reduce member lengths.",\n    \n    "analysis": "node_1 (0,0) is pinned, node_2 (6,0) is roller, node_3 (2,0) is loaded with 10 units at -45°. Direct connections from node_3 to both supports will carry most of the load. To close the truss, add a node above the base to form a triangle, distributing load more efficiently and reducing member forces. The triangle apex should be above node_3 for symmetry and direct load transfer. All members must be checked for stress and mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation is optimal: connect node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_2, and add an apex node above node_3 (say, node_4 at (3.0, 2.5)). Connect node_3-node_4, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4 to form two triangles. This closes the structure and splits the load efficiently. Member areas will be assigned based on expected force magnitude and length, using the lowest possible area that meets the stress constraint.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A triangle with an apex above node_3 provides vertical stiffness and splits the load efficiently to both supports. Placing node_4 at (3.0, 2.5) (midway between supports, above the loaded node) creates two similar triangles. This ensures short, direct load paths and keeps member lengths moderate. Assign area IDs by estimating member forces: the loaded node\'s diagonals will see the highest forces, so larger areas may be needed there. Lower areas can be used for the top chords and base.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume: E = 1 (unitless), load at node_3 is (-10*cos(45°), -10*sin(45°)) ≈ (-7.07, -7.07). Calculate member lengths and angles. For each member, estimate force by static equilibrium (method of joints). For each member, σ = |F|/A ≤ 20. Total mass = sum(length × area) ≤ 30. Assign area IDs to minimize mass while satisfying stress constraint. Try area_id \'2\' (A=0.782) for high-force members, \'1\' (A=0.195) for low-force members.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_2: 6.0, node_1-node_3: 2.0, node_2-node_3: 4.0, node_3-node_4: sqrt((1.0)^2 + (2.5)^2) ≈ 2.69, node_1-node_4: sqrt((3.0)^2 + (2.5)^2) ≈ 3.91, node_2-node_4: sqrt((3.0)^2 + (2.5)^2) ≈ 3.91. Assign: node_1-node_3 and node_2-node_3 as main load paths (area_id \'2\', A=0.782), node_3-node_4 also \'2\', node_1-node_2 (base) as \'1\', node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4 as \'1\'. Estimated forces: diagonals take most of the load, top chords and base much less. Mass = (6.0×0.195)+(2.0×0.782)+(4.0×0.782)+(2.69×0.782)+(3.91×0.195)+(3.91×0.195) ≈ 1.17+1.56+3.13+2.10+0.76+0.76=9.48 < 30. Check stresses: For diagonal with F≈10, σ=10/0.782≈12.8 < 20.
