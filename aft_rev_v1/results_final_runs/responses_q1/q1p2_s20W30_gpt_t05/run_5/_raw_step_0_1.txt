The objective is to minimize member stress while keeping total mass under 30 and stresses within ±20. The truss must be structurally sound, fully closed, and efficient under the applied load.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes are given: two supports (pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2) and a loaded node (node_3). The load acts at node_3 at 10 units magnitude, -45° (down and left). The truss must be closed, so all nodes must be interconnected, forming at least one loop. Mass and stress constraints are strict, so member areas must be chosen carefully. Additional nodes can be added for triangulation and better load distribution.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The given configuration is a horizontal base (node_1 to node_2) with node_3 between them at (2,0). The load at node_3 is downward and leftward, creating a risk of high bending and shear if not triangulated. The supports are at each end, so the structure must transfer the load efficiently. A simple triangle (connecting all three nodes) would be a minimal solution, but with all nodes colinear, it would be unstable. To close the truss and provide triangulation, an additional node above the baseline (say, node_4) is needed. This creates two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4), forming a stable, closed shape. This also distributes the load from node_3 more effectively to the supports.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The main insight is that the original three nodes are colinear, so any truss using only them would be unstable. By adding a new node above the baseline (y>0), we can create a closed, triangulated structure. Placing node_4 directly above node_3 (at x=2.0, y=2.5) gives symmetry and short member lengths. The load at node_3 will be shared by two diagonals (to node_1 and node_2) and a vertical (to node_4). Member areas must be chosen to keep stresses well within ±20, but not so large as to exceed total mass 30.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation is essential for stability and minimizing stress. By adding node_4 above node_3, we create two effective triangles. The vertical member from node_3 to node_4 takes the vertical component of the load directly, while diagonals transfer the load to the supports. This configuration minimizes bending and evenly distributes forces. Area selection will prioritize the highest forces (likely in the diagonals and vertical), using larger areas where needed and smaller for less loaded members. All nodes are connected, and the structure is closed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All joints are pin-connected, loads are static, self-weight is neglected except in mass calculation. Steps: 1) Place node_4 above node_3 (x=2.0, y=2.5). 2) Members: (node_1-node_3), (node_2-node_3), (node_1-node_4), (node_2-node_4), (node_3-node_4). 3) Calculate member lengths. 4) Estimate force in each member using method of joints (approximate, since load is at node_3, diagonals will see high force). 5) Assign area_id to each member to keep max stress ≤20 and total mass ≤30.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3: 2.0; node_2-node_3: 4.0; node_1-node_4: sqrt((2-0)^2 + (2.5-0)^2)=~3.20; node_2-node_4: sqrt((6-2)^2 + (2.5-0)^2)=~4.72; node_3-node_4: 2.5. Approximate member forces: diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4) take most of the load, vertical (node_3-node_4) takes vertical load. Assign area_id \'2\' (0.782) to diagonals, \'1\' (0.195) to less loaded horizontals, \'4\' (3.128) to the vertical. Mass: (2.0+4.0)*0.195 = 1.17; (3.20+4.72)*0.782 = 6.21; 2.5*3.128 = 7.82. Total mass ≈ 1.17+6.21+7.82 = 15.20 < 30. Stresses: diagonals see up to ~7-10 units force, so stress = force/area < 20 for all members.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints are satisfied: truss is closed, all nodes connected, mass <30, max stress <20.
