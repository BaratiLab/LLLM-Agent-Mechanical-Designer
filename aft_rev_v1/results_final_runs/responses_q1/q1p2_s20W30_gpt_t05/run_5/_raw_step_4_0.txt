The current structure is a closed truss with 5 nodes, 7 members, and satisfies all constraints (max |stress| 6.7 < 20, total mass 25.84 < 30). The objective is to further minimize the maximum absolute member stress while maintaining all constraints and a closed, connected structure.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The structure is already constraint-compliant, but the objective is to further minimize maximum stress. Inputs provide node/support/load locations, member connectivity, and historic alternatives (all with higher stress or constraint violations).",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current structure uses a compact, nearly symmetric configuration. Loads and supports are fixed (nodes 1, 2, 3). The truss forms two triangles above the base, efficiently transferring the load at node_3 (-10, -45°) to the supports. All members are engaged, with highest stress at member_1 (-6.70, compression), still well below the ±20 limit. Attempts to add more members (history) increased mass or violated constraints. Reducing member areas further risks overstressing. Node positions for supports and load are fixed; node_4 and node_5 can be fine-tuned.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The structure is efficient: triangulated, minimal mass, and stress is distributed. Most stress is carried in the lower chords and diagonals. Historic attempts to add more members or move nodes up resulted in higher stress or mass. The geometry is close to optimal for the given constraints.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Fine-tune positions of node_4 and node_5 upward and slightly outward to further reduce stress concentrations in the diagonal members and equalize force distribution. Slightly increase area for member_1 (highest compression) to reduce its stress, and reduce area for over-sized members with low stress (e.g., member_2, member_7) to save mass, as long as constraints are satisfied.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Raising node_4 and node_5 slightly increases the height of the triangles, reducing force in the diagonals and distributing load more evenly. Increasing area for the most stressed member and reducing area where possible is a standard optimization approach. All nodes remain connected, forming a closed structure. All supports and load locations are fixed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Nodes 1, 2, 3 fixed. Nodes 4, 5 can move up/out. Use area_id \'4\' (A=3.128) for member_1, area_id \'2\' (A=0.782) for member_2 and member_7 (low stress), keep others as is. Estimate new node_4 at (2.0, 2.2), node_5 at (4.0, 2.2).

Total mass ≈ 19.98 < 30. 4. Stresses: By increasing member_1 area, stress drops by ~30% to ≈ -4.7; other members remain below 7.0. Max(abs(stress)) ≈ 6.0 < 20.
