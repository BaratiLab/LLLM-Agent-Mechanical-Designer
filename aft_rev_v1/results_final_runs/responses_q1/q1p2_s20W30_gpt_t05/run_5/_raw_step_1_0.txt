The current design exceeds the max allowable stress (|stress|=55.6 > 20) but has acceptable mass (15.18 < 30). The goal is to minimize stress and mass while ensuring all nodes are structurally connected and constraints are satisfied.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The structure must: (1) limit max stress to ±20, (2) keep total mass ≤30, (3) be a closed truss with no isolated nodes, (4) use only specified area IDs. Node positions with supports/loads cannot change. Current structure is a basic quadrilateral with a diagonal, but the high stress (notably in member_1) indicates poor load distribution.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure: node_3 is between node_1 and node_2, with node_4 above node_3. Members connect all nodes to form a quadrilateral with a diagonal (node_3-node_4). The high compressive stress in member_1 (-55.6) suggests that the load at node_3 is not sufficiently triangulated and is causing excessive force in the bottom chord. The structure is not fully triangulated; the top is a single node, which means the load path is not efficiently distributed. In truss design, triangulation is essential for stability and stress minimization. The supports are well-placed at the ends, but the internal geometry is suboptimal for the applied load.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Overstressing at the base, especially between node_1 and node_3. The lack of a top chord or a second top node limits triangulation and increases force in the bottom members. Insight: Add a fifth node (node_5) at (4.0, 2.5) to form a closed Warren truss, which will allow for effective triangulation and better load distribution. This will reduce member forces and spread the load more evenly, lowering max stress. Retain all original nodes and their constraints.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign by adding one node (node_5) at (4.0, 2.5) to create a symmetric, fully triangulated truss (Warren truss form). Connect all nodes to form triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4), (node_3, node_2, node_5), (node_4, node_5, node_3), (node_1, node_4, node_5), and (node_1, node_5, node_2). Assign area IDs to balance mass and stress, using larger areas for highly stressed members.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A Warren truss provides optimal load paths for a concentrated load at midspan, especially with supports at both ends. By adding a top chord node (node_5) and triangulating, member forces are reduced and more evenly distributed. Symmetry ensures balanced load transfer, minimizing peak stresses. Members directly under the load and in the top chord will require larger area IDs, while diagonals and less-stressed members can use smaller areas. All nodes remain connected, forming a closed structure.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All joints are pinned, all loads are static, self-weight is included in mass calculation. Equilibrium equations (ΣFx=0, ΣFy=0, ΣM=0) will be used to estimate member forces. For the -10 kN load at -45°, the force splits equally between x and y. The new node_5 at (4.0, 2.5) is chosen to keep symmetry and efficient triangulation. Member lengths calculated by distance formula. Stress = force/area; member with max stress will govern area selection. Use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for most members, \'3\' (1.759) for those expected to see high force (bottom chord), and \'1\' (0.195) for least stressed diagonals.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member layout: \\n- Bottom chord: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2\\n- Top chord: node_4-node_5\\n- Verticals: node_3-node_4, node_3-node_5\\n- Diagonals: node_1-node_4, node_1-node_5, node_2-node_5, node_2-node_4\\nLengths: \\n- node_1-node_3: 2.00 m\\n- node_3-node_2: 4.00 m\\n- node_1-node_4: sqrt(2^2 + 2.5^2) ≈ 3.20 m\\n- node_3-node_4: 2.50 m\\n- node_4-node_5: 2.00 m\\n- node_3-node_5: sqrt(2^2 + 2.5^2) ≈ 3.20 m\\n- node_2-node_5: sqrt(2^2 + 2.5^2) ≈ 3.20 m\\n- node_2-node_4: sqrt(4^2 + 2.5^2) ≈ 4.72 m\\nMass: sum(length × area).
