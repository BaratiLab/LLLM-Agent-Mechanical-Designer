The objective is to minimize stress and mass while ensuring all nodes are connected in a closed, triangulated structure and constraints on stress and total mass are strictly satisfied.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes are given, with a load at node_3 (-10kN at -45°), pinned support at node_1, roller at node_2. The structure must be closed and optimized for both mass (<30) and stress (|σ| ≤ 20). The minimal closed topology is a triangle, but additional triangulation may help distribute the load. Area selection is discrete.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The load at node_3 is significant and oblique, producing both horizontal and vertical force components. Given only three nodes, the minimal closed truss is a triangle: node_1-node_2-node_3. However, this may create high stress in the members due to limited redundancy. Adding a fourth node above the base can allow for better load distribution and lower stresses via triangulation. The supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) suggest the base should be stable, and the load path should direct forces efficiently into these supports.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "A basic triangle (node_1-node_2-node_3) will likely exceed stress limits due to the acute angle at node_3 and the oblique load. Adding a fourth node above the base, forming two triangles, will better distribute the load and reduce peak member forces. The fourth node should be placed near the centroid of the triangle but slightly above to maximize triangulation efficiency.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Structural efficiency is improved by triangulation, especially under oblique loads. By introducing a fourth node (\'node_4\') at (3.0, 2.5), above the base and near the centroid, we create two triangles: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_2-node_3-node_4. This distributes the load from node_3 through node_4 to both supports, reducing the force in any single member. Members connecting node_4 to all three base nodes complete the closed structure and provide redundancy. Area selections are made to minimize mass while ensuring all member stresses remain within ±20.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume all members are pin-connected. Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance. Resolve the applied force at node_3 into x and y components. Set up equilibrium equations at each node. Estimate member forces via method of joints. For each member, calculate stress = |force|/area. Select the minimum area_id that keeps stress ≤ 20. Compute total mass as sum(length × area). Adjust area_id upwards only if stress constraint is exceeded.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Load at node_3: Fx = -10*cos(45°) ≈ -7.07, Fy = -10*sin(45°) ≈ -7.07. Node positions: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(3,2.5). Member lengths: node_1-node_2: 6.0, node_1-node_3: 2.0, node_2-node_3: 4.0, node_1-node_4: sqrt((3)^2 + (2.5)^2) ≈ 3.91, node_2-node_4: sqrt((3)^2 + (2.5)^2) ≈ 3.91, node_3-node_4: sqrt((1)^2 + (2.5)^2) ≈ 2.69. Use method of joints: most loaded members will be those directly connecting node_3 to supports and node_4. Start with area_id \'1\' (0.195) for all members and check stresses. If any exceed 20, increase area_id. After iterative adjustments, optimal areas are: node_1-node_3: area_id \'3\', node_2-node_3: area_id \'3\', node_3-node_4: area_id \'2\', node_1-node_4: area_id \'2\', node_2-node_4: area_id \'2\', node_1-node_2: area_id \'1\'. Total mass: (2.0×1.759)+(4.0×1.759)+(2.69×0.782)+(3.91×0.782)+(3.91×0.782)+(6.0×0.195) ≈ 3.52+7.04+2.10+3.06+3.06+1.17 ≈ 19.95 < 30.
