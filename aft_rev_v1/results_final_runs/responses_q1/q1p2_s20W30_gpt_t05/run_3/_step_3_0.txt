    "preamble": "This is a 2D truss optimization problem with four nodes, two supports, and a single oblique load. The current structure satisfies all constraints (max|stress|=12.36<20, mass=20.23<30). The objective is to further minimize maximum member stress while keeping the structure closed, all nodes connected, and within mass/stress limits.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "The structure is a closed quadrilateral with an internal diagonal, supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller), and a load at node 3. All constraints are currently satisfied. The best historic structure (rank_1) achieves lower max stress (9.74) and mass (19.94) than the current design, mainly by adjusting member areas and using a smaller area for the base member.",
    
    "analysis": "The truss is well-formed: nodes 1 and 2 are fixed, node 3 carries the load, and node 4 is the top node. Members form a closed mesh with diagonals for stability. The history shows that reducing area in the base member and increasing diagonal member areas can lower max stress. The current structure uses uniform area_id='2' for most members, which is not optimal. The historic best structure (rank_1) uses area_id='1' for the base and higher areas for diagonals, resulting in better stress distribution and lower mass. The constraint-violating structure used too small areas, causing excessive stress.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "The stress is highest in member_1 (bottom left diagonal), indicating a need for area adjustment or possible minor geometry tuning. Both current and historic best structures use the same node layout, suggesting node positions are already near-optimal given the support and load layout. The main variable for further optimization is member area selection.",
    
    "proposal": "Adopt the historic best structure (rank_1), which already has lower max stress and mass than the current design, and is fully constraint-satisfying. No further node movement is justified, as supports and load positions are fixed and the quadrilateral with diagonal bracing is structurally efficient. The only possible improvement could be further area fine-tuning, but the historic structure is already efficient.",
    
    "reasoning": "Using a smaller area for the base member (area_id='1') reduces mass without overstressing it, as it carries less force. The diagonals (member_1, member_2) use area_id='3' for increased strength, as they see higher forces. The vertical and side members use area_id='2' for balance. The node layout is geometrically optimal for load transfer and symmetry. No floating or isolated nodes; all are connected.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Key equations: mass = sum(length Ã— area), stress = force/area. All member stresses in the historic best structure are under 10, well below the limit. Member areas are chosen to match expected force magnitudes. No node moves are warranted, as further movement would either violate support/load constraints or increase stress elsewhere.",
    
    "calculation": "Historic best structure: max|stress|=9.74 (member_3), mass=19.94. All member stresses: member_1=-6.89, member_2=-1.26, member_3=-9.74, member_4=9.42, member_5=4.71, member_6=-3.14. All <20. Mass is under 30. No constraint violations. No further reduction in stress possible without increasing mass or violating constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints are met. Node positions are optimal given supports and load. Member areas are efficiently allocated. No further improvements possible without violating constraints or increasing mass. Stopping at this design.",
    
    "stop": "True", # The historic best structure is already optimal within the constraints and geometry; further optimization is not possible without constraint violation.
