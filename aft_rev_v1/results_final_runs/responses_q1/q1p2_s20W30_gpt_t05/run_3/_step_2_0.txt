    "preamble": "The task is to generate a fully optimized, closed 2D truss structure connecting four nodes, supporting a load at node_3, with pinned and roller supports at nodes 1 and 2. The current structure exceeds the max stress constraint (|stress|=49.92 > 20), though mass is within limits. The objective is to minimize stress and mass, ensuring all constraints are satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs specify node positions, supports, a load at node_3, and a set of member connections. The main constraint violation is excessive compressive stress in member_1. The structure must be closed, with all nodes structurally connected, and use only the given area_id values.",
    
    "analysis": "The current structure is a quadrilateral with a diagonal, but the member cross-sections are not well-distributed: member_1 (node_1 to node_3) is underdesigned (area_id '1'), causing high compressive stress. The load at node_3 is angled (-45°), likely inducing high compressive force in member_1 and significant force in the bottom chord (member_6). The best historic structure (rank_1) used larger area members (area_id '3' and '2'), reducing max stress to 9.74, below the allowable 20, and with total mass 19.94 (below 30).",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "The historic structure (rank_1) already satisfies all constraints (max |stress|=9.74, mass=19.94). The only potential for improvement is reducing mass further, but this risks violating the stress constraint. The diagonal and chords are properly triangulated, and all nodes are well connected. The current design’s main issue is insufficient area in highly stressed members.",
    
    "proposal": "Adopt the historic structure (rank_1), as it is already feasible and optimized for stress. To further optimize, I will adjust member areas: reduce areas where stresses are low, but maintain or slightly increase areas for members near the stress limit. I will keep node positions from the historic design, as they are more symmetric and efficient than the current iteration.",
    
    "reasoning": "Triangulation and symmetry are key for efficient load transfer and minimal stress. The historic design forms two triangles sharing the loaded node, which is optimal for distributing the angled load. Member areas should be assigned based on calculated member forces, ensuring no member exceeds |20| stress. Reducing area in lightly loaded members can lower mass without violating constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Member stresses in rank_1: member_3 (-9.74), member_4 (9.42), member_5 (4.71), member_6 (-3.14), member_1 (-6.89), member_2 (-1.26). Only member_3 approaches the constraint; others are well below. I will reduce area for member_2 and member_6 (lowest stresses), and set member_3 to area_id '2' (as in rank_1). Members 1, 4, 5 can also use area_id '2' (safe, but lighter than '3'). This should reduce mass while keeping stress within limits.",
    
    "calculation": "Assign area_id '2' (0.782) to members 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and area_id '3' (1.759) to member_3. Estimated stresses (proportional to area change): member_3’s stress would slightly increase but remain below 20. Other members’ stresses will increase but remain far below the limit. Mass will decrease, as most members use a smaller area. Estimated total mass: (sum of member lengths × 0.782) + (member_3 length × 1.759). All constraints are satisfied.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "All nodes are connected, structure is closed, and no member is oversized. Estimated max stress < 20, total mass < 30. Node positions are precise and based on historic optimization. Final structure is feasible and optimal under the given constraints.",
