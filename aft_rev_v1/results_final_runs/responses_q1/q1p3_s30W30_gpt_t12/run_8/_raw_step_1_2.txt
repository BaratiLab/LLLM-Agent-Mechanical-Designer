The initial structure exceeds maximum allowed stress due to slender and/or undersized members.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "1st iteration: The structure has three support/load base nodes (node_1: pinned, node_2: roller, node_3: midspan), a fourth joint (node_4) for triangulation, and stressed members nearly at their limit. Stress notably exceeds maximum tensile (-49.56 vs. -30 allowed), with member_5 (node_1-node_3) as the most critical.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Boundary is a 3m-wide span, loaded at node_3 diagonal. Current truss is nearly a Warren truss, but node_3---midspan node---is directly between supports with an off-axis live load, probable creating an unfavourable force distribution (especially in member_5, a horizontal tie at bottom).\\\n    Maximum stress is observed in member_5 (node_1-node_3), likely carrying nearly the full vertical load owing to an ineffective force distribution (heavy compression/tension in the bottom chord lacking triangulated support at node_3). The current choice of cross sections further accentuates member overstress. Closed form is weak against diagonal off-axis loading and the configuration is not optimal for stress dispersal. Triangle heights may also be too low, increasing lever arms and chord forces. Area selection for key members (especially member_5) is undersized (using area_id \'1\'=0.195 for a heavily loaded member when more so is warranted). History confirms structural overloading persists since inception.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Repeated problem: overloaded lower chord. Diagonal load not resolved efficiently. Probable solution: Increase structural depth, redistribute diagonals, close lower chord triangle at node_3. Evaluate cross-section increase for overstressed members but prevent overmass. Consider expanding to 5 nodes for more effective load-triangulation.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign: Retain supports and load nodes as fixed, add a fifth node (node_5) below node_3 to deepen midspan and triangulate loading path. Connect all nodes to ensure closure, substituting trapezoidal/Warren geometry with sub-triangulation at load point. Upsize members as needed (especially for those directly resolving loaded reaction). Select the minimum area for lightly loaded, and the next viable area for high-force members, balancing mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Structurally, deepening the truss below at node_3 improves lever arms (reducing axial force in bottom chord). Subtriangulation prevents single member overload and routes the off-axis load through multiple triangles, significantly reducing local stress. Every node (including node_3, the loaded node) must have at least three members converging for proper force transfer. Critical members (path from supports through load) should use sufficiently large cross-sections (optimally area_id \'2\'=0.782 or \'3\'=1.759) for force reduction, balancing mass and stress.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "- Fixed: node_1 (0,0 pins), node_2 (6.0,0 rollers), node_3 (2.0,0 load):- Add: node_5 below node_3 to make a pronounced triangle (try (2.0, -1.50)).\\\n    - All nodes must be in triangles; members = top (node_1-node_2), two verticals (to node_3 and new node_5), all logical diagonals (closures, avoiding unnecessarily long unsupported spans).\\\n    - Area selection mix: Vertical/midspan/diagonals higher area than long horizontal chords.\\\n    - Calculate resultant from applied load map: F = 10kN at -45\\u00b0 on node_3 splits into x=-7.071, y=-7.071kN\\\n    - Conservative assignment: critical load-path members get area_id \'2\' (0.782), noncritical get area_id \'1\' (0.195), chords can go \'1\'.\\\n    - Mass calculation: sum of member lengths * area. \\\n    - Prelim stress: under simple load-balance, deepest truss height gives force/moment arms favorably.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Area options considered: Start by assigning area_id \'2\' (0.782) to all members in high-force area (around load/supported spans),, area_id \'1\' elsewhere.
