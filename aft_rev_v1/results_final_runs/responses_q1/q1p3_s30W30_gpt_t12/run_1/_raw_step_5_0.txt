The given optimized attempts are either overdesigned (mass > 30) or highly overstressed. The design must be a single connected closure, with rational arrangement and careful sizing of members.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Successively lighter designs dramatically exceed the stress limit; heavier triangulated structures readily meet stress targets, but overshoot the tight total mass constraint. Reflection: Weight and strength need balance—elimination or resizing of long/heavy/non-critical members and optimal node positioning are paramount, especially above/below the loaded node.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Looking at the status and generation history: The current design greatly exceeds the mass constraint (mass ≈ 97 vs. max allowed 30), yet respects the max stress (6.89 ≤ 30). Past minimal-mass structures fail – stressed up to 40–55, violating allowable limits, as they could not efficiently triangulate/support load with sufficiently light members. Load is applied at node_3 (-10 kN at −45°, i.e., down and left). Supports at node_1 (pinned, left), node_2 (roller, right) force vertical/horizontal force pathing through base nodes. A structurally efficient form to distribute force is the double intersecting (Warren) truss with verticals near load and tighter geometry, or K-truss local thickening near loaded node. The workable envelope demands minimizing upper node heights, increasing intersection angles to stretch area-use, as well as judicious up-sizing/sizing-down select members for strength-heavy placement only at critical legs.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The biggest friction point is the overly heavy cross-section area choices for long perimeter members, driven by stress or deflection considerations. Must find minimal (often 0 or 1) sections except where direct force transfer risks overload; heavy upper chords are overkill. Lightweight inner triangle members targeting the highest-stress (around the loaded node) can distribute the loading more efficiently. Ensure closed form—no isolate; no floating nodes.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign for minimal-mass closed truss: compact height for triangles, minimize vertical reach/diagonal member length to decrease mass, and adjust cross-sections to just cover their expected stress role. The nodal arrangement will retain node_1, node_2, node_3 (support/load constraint). Relocate ‘apex’/interior nodes strategically above loaded node for maximized triangulation effect while keeping vertical rises shallow (~1.2 to 1.7m), so member lengths don\'t inflate. All triangles closed: direct ground, upper, and diagonal connections; minimal verticals, eliminate excess.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Symmetry and triangulation are paramount for minimum mass & viable stress. The load arrives not at the main triangle tip, but inside the base, favoring a locally dense triangulation above/around node_3. Propose a three-bay shallow \'Pratt-Howe/Warren\' with upper tricked nodes. Major diagonals route force efficiently. Key: Negotiating minimally sized areas (Area IDs 0/1/2/3) across longer members—internal zigzags can stress-relieve short upper triangles with finer cross-sections. For base, preserve direct node_1---node_3---node_5---node_2; slight height reduction at the apex to shrink long upper chords, plus targeted internal diagonal and vertical connections above node_3 and 5.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume max internal member force peaks near loaded node’s vertical members (~8–14) and base-around-diagonals. Quick estimate: the predominantly compressed bottom (right of node_3), axially-stressed; diagonal tension/compression splits as per -45º resultant; the upper node triangulates force path, horizontal chords less taxed due to shallow height. Member lengths L via Euclid sqrt. Mass=sum(L*A_id). Assign area candidates: try 2 (A=0.782) for diagonals at n_3; trial 1 (0.195) for longer non-critical chords, and step up to 3 (1.759) if stress at a member approaches 20. Structure: form triangles across each span, connect upper nodes near known high-shear regions, crank closer upper node to the left by 15–30% → collapse excessive member length. Estimate total mass by member count × average length × area, aim for ≤ 29.8, tuning areas if single members exceed 28~30 in stress.",\n    \n    "calculation": "New node proposal: node_1: (0,0), node_2: (6,0), node_3: (2,0). Add node_4 apex at (3.0, 1.2)[shallow], node_5 mid right at (4.0,0), node_6 minor upper at (2.8,0.9) (~above loaded node), node_7 right mini-apex at (4.2,0.85). Connections: strictly base members (node_1–node_3–node_5–node_2); three top triangle nodes (node_4, node_6, node_7); close diagonals and verticals as below. Member assignments: Heavy cross-section only for primary vertical & diagonal near loaded/support edges (area_id \'2\' or \'3\'), lightest for upper chords (area_id \'0\', \'1\'). Mass estimate: ~9 chord lengths ~2.2–3.8m each × mean A~0.5 ≈ 27; keep the longest at very low A if lightly loaded. Check triangles for closure, all force transfer paths enabled. Checking axial force balance on diagonals/vertical near node_3 under −10/√2 ~ −7.07\xa0N horizontally; thus peak probable diagonal force between 8 and 16, i.e. needs A ≥ 0.782, pref. \'2\'/\'3\'. Verify that base/upper chords and off-demand diagonals stay <\xa015\xa0load so that A_id\xa0‘1’ or ‘2’ suffices.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final":"Final pre-check: Ensure all constraints. All nodes included, all triangles closed; no isolated point. Only used listed area_id. Support nodes/load nodes at fixed places and untouched. Cumulative member mass summing below 30.
