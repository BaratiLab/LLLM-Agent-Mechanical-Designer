The objective is to minimize member stresses within ±30 while keeping total mass below 30, using a select area set.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "With only three given nodes (all are collinear along y=0), a bare triangle won\'t provide lateral stiffness or stress minimization. Optimality will require either skillful placement of one or more auxiliary nodes to enable triangulation, or checking efficient direct trussing most capable of handling the applied load direction. Supports (pinned at left, roller at right) mean horizontal stability at node_2 must come from structure geometry.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current setup: node_1 at (0,0), node_2 at (6,0), node_3 at (2,0). Node_3 receives -10 units load at -45°, decomposed as (Fx, Fy) ≈ (-7.07, -7.07). The only possible triangle with these nodes is extremely flat (collinear!), highly ineffective in practice—leads to instability and high member force. To achieve a proper closed truss aiding force transfer, a fourth node (ideally above the axis for triangulation) is needed. Propose to add node_4 at/near centroid or aligning to load path for minimization.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Introduce node_4 at (2.0, 2.5) (directly above loaded node_3) to enable an equilateral, balanced triangle comprising supports and node_4, and thus two vertical-angled members sharing the applied force through tension/compression more efficiently. Two new subtriangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4), (node_3, node_2, node_4), close the structure, maximize inherent redundancy against overturning effects, and direct the applied load more naturally.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By placing node_4 vertically above node_3, effective triangulation is achieved, maximally reducing lever arm effect of node_3\'s applied load while yielding efficient force paths directly to supports. Ensuring member sizes along major force paths are larger relieves stress. The area values will be selected larger for members with highest anticipated force, optimizing lighter sections for minor support triangles, with stress and mass capped by constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Key assumptions: Nodes 1 & 2 (supports) remain at given locations. Node_4 added at (2, 2.5). Members: (1-3), (3-2), (1-4), (4-2), (3-4), forming two main triangles. Load splits roughly between two triangles converging at node_3 and traveling through node_4 to supports. Calculate lengths: 1-3 = 2.0, 3-2 = 4.0, 1-4 = sqrt(2^2+2.5^2)=3.2, 4-2 = sqrt(4^2+2.5^2)=4.72, 3-4 = 2.5. Guess main force follows (3-4-1) and (3-4-2) triangulation.
