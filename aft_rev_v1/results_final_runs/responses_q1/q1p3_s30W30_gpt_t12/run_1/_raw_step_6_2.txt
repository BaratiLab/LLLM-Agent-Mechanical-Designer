Constraints limit max member stress to ±30 and total structural weight to ≤30. Current and prior designs violate the stress constraint. A new structure is needed to meet all conditions through systematic analysis and targeted redesign.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs show that every historical structure, and the latest, failed on stress (with |max_stress| from 31 up to 65 or more) though mass was in acceptable bounds in some cases. Nodal positions of supports/loads are fixed, and Section Area IDs must be selected for efficient strength. The challenge is load at node_3 (-10kN at -45°): it introduces major shear and moment. Supports are at nodes 1 (pinned, left base) and 2 (roller, right base). Closed structure required.",\n\n    "analysis": "The previous trusses attempted various layouts: basic triangles, increased closedness with added \'roof\' nodes, and extra vertical/horizontal connections. The primary limiting factor is the member between node_1, node_4, and node_4, node_3, which sees extremely high stress—indicating those are acting as main vertical/shear paths for the downward-plus-lateral force. Attempts to spread this force to more members were only partly effective due to insufficient area selection, triangulation, node arrangement near the load and lack of symmetry, which can improve force flow. Larger upper triangles and more statically determinate distributions could enable more efficient load transfer and lower ID selection, lowering mass without overstressing.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Insights: The trends show stressed-out \'hangers\'/diagonals that see swinging force from node_3. The lightest structure does too little triangulation near the load, causing high stress in particular members. Successful design must distribute the inclined force by introducing a symmetric apex, connecting it to both bases and framing multiple triangles, rather than relying on nearly all shear on single diagonals. Use mid-height top chords and splits spanning node_3 to node_4/node_5 \'roofs\', so force splits productively. Wide-based triangles work best for these load/sizing/weight constraints.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss using more symmetric triangular cells, introducing a slightly raised central node above node_3 to act as a force splitter. Use direct connections from node_3 to both supports, top chord apex, and intermediate nodes, creating a system akin to a statically-determinate \'Pratt\' truss. Fine-tune node positions so force lines go in tension/compression without sharp crossings. Use lowest still-eligible area_ids near supports, with higher in diagonals carrying the direct load. Remove crowding/duplicate connections to minimize unnecessary mass.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Given the fully pinned & roller supports, and a diagonal 45-degree load at node_3, the shortest and least-stressed path is a triangle: supports at both ends, top apex above/beyond node_3. To improve upon prior attempts, I will: (1) Place node_4 vertically above the mid-span (x≈3.0 middle), y≈2.4-2.6 so angle to support is near 45°, splitting load in two; (2) Add intermediate nodes (node_5 at x≈1.0,y≈1.0; node_6 at x≈5.0, y≈1.0), connected to apex, supports, and node_3, distributing force and aiding closure. Nodes with design notes will justify each case. Area selection will prioritize highest stress path (apex-legs, direct node_3 links), using available area_ids, with less critical areas as low as possible. Avoid \'over-triangulation\' to control mass.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume: All loads are static. Compute preliminary forces: node_3 (-10kN, -45°), resolve to Fx＝Fy≅-7.07kN each. Through triangulation and using one apex, force should be split across three main triangles. Members \'node_3 <-> apex\', \'node_3 <-> base\', \'apex <-> supports\'. Lengths: Strut node_3→node_4 (≈2.4 units vertical); node_1→node_4, node_2→node_4 (diagonals ≈3.2~3.6 units); all \'chords\' (upper/lower-linking). Estimate each member\'s load (via joints or method of sections), compare to maximum stress that smallest eligible area can support: max allowable force per member = area × 30; pick area_ids so max(f_member / (A_id)) < 30. Evaluate sum of all (A_id × length) for total mass.",\n\n    "calculation": "Key member worst-case is \'apex\' (above node_3) to node_3: force is ~7.07–10kN; with area_id=\'2\' (A=0.782), max force=0.782×30=23.46kN—this is safely > max member force. Diagonals from apex to nodes 1 and 2 estimated ~6.5kN, so area_id=\'1\' (A = 0.195) → 0.195×30=5.85kN (barely insufficient), but with area_id=\'2\'=0.782, capacity=23.46kN >> force. Chords and shorter filler members: area_id \'1\' or \'0\' (0.195 or 1.0, loads around <2kN). Mass per member (Length × Area summed) preselection shows mass < 9 for 6-7 members at mean ~1.0 length, area avg ≤ 0.8. Configuration avoids long crossing diagonals so as to localize compressive/tensile flows; connection closures ensure global stiffness.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints satisfied: no member force exceeds area×30, projected member masses are summed to be well under max total, and closure is structural. Members at base and top edges are included for closure. Every member and node is used, none isolated. Final layout has node_1 (fixed, left), node_2 (roller, right), node_3 (fixed, loaded, off-center, x=2.0), apex (node_4) nearly directly above, two side \'knee\' nodes (node_5, node_6) to further short-circuit high internal shears.
