Previous iterations failed constraint checks, with some members showing stresses >40.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: Get max(abs(stress)) below 30, and total mass below or around 10; both feasible with up to 6 nodes. All nodes must be connected (structure must be \'closed\'). Key load is a -10kN force at a -45° diagonal on node_3.",\n\n    "analysis": "The prior design makes node_4 central (above midspan of 0–6m) with multiple thin (area_id \'1\') connections. Members connecting node_3 and the top central node (node_4) are underused, while at least one member (node_6: node_4–node_1) is over-stressed (+40.88, >30). History shows denser designs distribute stress but have disproportionate mass (e.g., 37.8: constraint_not_met_2). Force transfer appears to overload the central key vertical/tie members, indicating an imbalance. Increasing panel height (raising central node_4 higher), slightly increasing upper chord thickness, and providing an extra bottom or diagonal member can reduce stress concentration.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: High stresses repeatedly arise in the top web/tie, adjacent to the load input (node_3: -10kN at -45 deg). The prior truss centralizes the load path through arguably too-slender ties (area_id \'1\', 0.195). Increasing the area and lengthening verticals/diagonals should tap into more material without much extra mass. Efficient triangulation and some thickness variation are key. Developing two extra diagonals creates alternative stress flow.",\n\n    "proposal": "Modify current nodal layout and member areas. Keep supports and node_3 static per constraint. Move current node_4 higher by ~0.7 (from 2.2→2.9), spread node_5 slightly for better triangulation, add new top node (node_6) as a mid-upper apex for greater triangulation. Members: Thicken key tie/diagonal where over-stress appeared (node_4–node_1); convert that to area_id \'2\' (0.782). For newly routed diagonals, pick moderate area (\'1\'–\'2\'). Chord members use \'2\' for initial feasibility with ~6–8 main members. This should avert overstress, adjust load distribution, and keep total mass under 12 with margin.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "In a bridge-type or gable truss under asymmetrical load, raising the \'roof\' apex (node_4) shares load into diagonals rather than leaving excessive thrust in the vertical tie. Cross-diagonals from apex to supports/offests help with lateral force transfer. Using more balanced triangulation and allowing vertical nodes near load-in points gives multiple load sharing paths, minimizing critical member stress. Moderate to moderately-high areas are placed along principal stress routes, narrower sections suffice elsewhere.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume: -10kN @ node_3 (-45°)—equals -7.07kN X, -7.07kN Y; supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Estimated max member length for 3–6m with panel heights 2–3m gives longest member ~3.5m. Try areas: main chords at \'2\' (0.782), troubled diagonals at \'2\', cross diagonals/webs at \'1\' (0.195). Total member count 8–9. Estimate mass: (~6–8 zones at ~2.5–3m, areas 0.195–0.782) ~ 1 to 1.5 per member, so max total ~10–12. Adjust those failing, i.e., >30 MPa/member.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Key members calculated for axial force under diagonally-inclined applied load and support geometry. For main \'failed\' member (prior: area 0.195, stress +40.9), increasing to area 0.782 reduces stress to ~10. Estimate for new apex height y=2.9 brings diagonal lengths up from 2.57 (orig, 2.2 rise, 3m run) to 3.4m (2.9 rise, 3m run), redistributing diagonal loads. With two-right, two-left top diagonals and low (~1m) bottom cross member, flows are further balanced. All main paths checked; the highest force (orig >8548 N) would reduce under higher area and split load. Ties checked for ~7kN (10kN×sin 45) as upper bound; with F=stress×area, area_limit=absolute_force/30, so any member with more than |24000N|/30=800N needs >0.266. Several members at area_id \'2\' (0.782) easily suffice capacity for 20–24kN; web sections may be thinner.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Topology: use six nodes—keep fixed node_1 (0, 0); node_2 (6, 0, roller); node_3 (2, 0: loaded). For a better \'roof\', raise node_4 apex (3, 2.90). Stretch bottom span (node_5 at 4, 0), and augment the truss with a new node_6 (3, 1.6—new mid-panel lower chord) for secondary triangulation. Connections: lower chords join consecutive buddies; upper chords (roof) across node_4. Diagonals from node_4 (apex) to node_3 and node_5 (left and right mid-chords); mid-vertical node_6 gets diagonals up to node_4 and out to base nodes. All nodes connected; no isolation. Members assigned minimal needed area for stress < |30| (runs <7kN/mem); main diagonals chord at \'2\', webs/extra diagonal at \'1\'.
