Main constraint violation: max(abs(stress))=34.35 (>30); total mass=25.35 (OK). Required change is to reduce stress (especially in member_2: -34.35).",\n\n    "analysis": "Max stress violation is primarily in member_2 (\'node_1\'-\'node_3\') with severe compression/tension, indicating force paths are not well triangulated and certain members are overstressed. Pin/roller supports with a 4-noded quasi-lattice. Member areas are mostly modest except diagonals. The structure is closed but triangulation is basic, reliant on hexagonal closed loop, which means certain diagonals (esp. near loaded \'node_3\') are too slender or not aligned with the load. Historic structure uses same form as current, so further redesign is necessary. To minimize max stress, it\'s commonly best to introduce additional triangulation near the force input and increase critical member areas slightly, not exceeding mass limit.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Stress concentrations are in short vertical/horizontal chords, i.e., member_2 between support and force application; typical in non-idle frames. Need stronger diagonals for load path, or planform modification (add node above \'node_3\' or stiffen \'node_1\'-\'node_3\' chord). Cannot move support/force nodes. Must add redundancy or redistribute forces via new node(s) and/or diagonal(s). Sufficient area sizing in most members, so small node reposition and improved connectivity with compact triangulation is appropriate.",\n\n    "proposal": "Propose to add a fifth node above \'node_3\', add bracing from supports to this top node, and redistribute masses for each member to ensure most highly-stressed ones get larger areas (via \'area_id\'), others minimal. The extra node and strategic bracing triangulate the bottom chord (support-to-load) that previously held maximal stress and creates alternate stress pathways, equalizing load and reducing member_2 overload. Optimize member cross-sections based on expected force flow to stay beneath ~75% of stress capacity in any member. All modifications preserve support and loaded node positions and maintain a closed (no open ends) frame.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Structural principle: Triangulation and the creation of efficient load paths reduce peak forces. By adding node_5 at (2.0, 1.4)—directly above the loaded node_3, symmetrically between supports—we form two deep triangles (node_1-node_5-node_3 and node_2-node_5-node_3), plus broad diagonals directly distributing load to supports. Assign larger areas to members subjected to significant compressive/tensile loads; minimize area elsewhere. This creates a \'W-truss\' between supports with balance and sufficient stiffness. The geometry leverages both vertical and inclined bracing so both horizontal and downward forces are well reacted.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume all supports immovable. New top node above node_3 at (2.0,1.4) (slightly below centroid between supports, and in *vertical* line above forced point per typical Pratt/Warren truss loadpath geometry). All nodes remain exactly or closely at original except for intermediate. Member forces determined via classic joint equilibrium; top vertical (node_5-node_3) handles most direct downward load caused by force. Inclined members redistribute horizontal/vertical reaction. Assign \'area_id\'=2 (0.782) for critical inclined diagonals, \'area_id\'=0 (1.0) for less stressed horizontal chords and upper diagonal triangle. Connect all 4 base nodes appropriately, close the truss with triangles. Closest member configuration uses 9 members forming three overlapping triangles.",\n\n    "calculation": "Estimate: Load at node_3 distributed mainly through newly added vertical (node_5-node_3) and diagonals (node_1-node_5, node_2-node_5), reducing direct stress through member_2 (\'node_1\'-\'node_3\'). Assume even split of 10kN → approx 5kN in each major diagonal/vertical. Horizontal/sheer inferred through statics (node at top only handles Y-component directly). Diagonal force = F / (length/vertical proj) = ~5kN / 1.4 ≈ 3.57kN. Select area so max stress < 30 → (F/A) = 3.6kN/0.782 ≈ 4.6MPa << 30. Mass adds as length × area summed. Expected that total mass stays below constraint given added members are short vertical/diagonal and sizing is optimal reasoning; length totals estimated under 30 units. All base nodes fully connected, all triangles closed = closed truss.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Design now distributes load efficiently. Check full triangulation- all nodes have >2 connections; diagonals, vertical and base chords closed. Member areas chosen such that in any member the expected stress under applied loads is < ±30. Mass is checked by summing each member\'s length multiplied by area from the area table.
