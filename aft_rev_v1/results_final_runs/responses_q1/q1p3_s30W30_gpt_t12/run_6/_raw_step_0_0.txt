Supports are pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Load acts on node_3. Selective cross-section (area) and closure ensure stress ≤\xa030, mass ≤\xa030, and robust force transfer.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives: Close/triangulated truss from three linearly distributed nodes. Min stress. Area from discrete set, mass ≤ 30. Consider added central node or use full triangle for most effective load sharing. Primary challenge: force transfer from loaded node_3 with min member stress across compact members.",\n    \n    "analysis": "With nodes at (0,0), (2,0), and (6,0), the system is initially nearly collinear (inefficient). Triangular closure is key. Load at node_3 (-10kN @ -45°) favors diagonal bracing. Supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller) need uplift/thrust routing. Efficient triangulation and strategic area selection are essential to stay within mass and stress constraints—vertical offset with extra node for efficient triangulation recommended.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The collinearity would give poor load transfer and high member stress if joined naively. To enable triangular load paths, introduce a fourth node (apex node) above the base. Full connectivity/closure requires six members. Strive for balance—x-position close to loaded node_3 and y sufficiently positive—increases efficiency, minimizes longest member.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Using triangulation and short span, place a new node_4 vertically above node_3 at symmetric reasonable height y=2.8, just above loaded node to preserve global symmetry and ensure closure and all mutual connections. This delivers three main triangles: node_1–node_2–node_3, node_1–node_3–node_4, node_2–node_3–node_4. All-nodes-closed. Member area selection then prioritizes high-force members with higher area.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Let node_4 be at (2.5, 2.8). Members: 1-2, 2-3, 3-1, 1-4, 2-4, 3-4 for efficient closure and load shedding. Calculate geometric lengths. For loads, estimate force paths: member 3-4 sustains main diagonal exhaust, choose area_3 (1.759) for diagonal, thinner (area_1=0.195, 0.782) for base. For mass, ensure sum of length*area ≤ 30.
