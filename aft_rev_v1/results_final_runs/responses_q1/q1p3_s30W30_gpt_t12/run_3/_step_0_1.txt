    "preamble": "Given three collinear base nodes with a concentrated load and asymmetric supports, the task is to optimize a fully connected 2D truss structure (with added nodes as needed) that minimizes maximum stress while satisfying area/mass constraints and enclosing all nodes in a single closed truss.",

    "scratch_pad_1": "The node positions are collinear horizontally: node_1 at (0,0), node_3 at (2,0) where the load applies, and node_2 at (6,0). Node_1 is 'pinned,' node_2 is 'roller'. Need a force-resisting structure to transmit load from node_3 efficiently to supports, avoid stress excess. Must connect all nodes; triangulation needed as otherwise truss is simple line (mechanism).",

    "analysis": "All three nodes lie on x-axis, so a basic single triangle cannot be formed. Direct connection (node_1-node_3-node_2) would buckle or have excessive stresses as it cannot resolve Y-direction force from load at node_3. Triangulation critical. Introduce an upper node to allow formation of two triangles (Warren truss fundamental). Place at optimal vertical height over node_3 for symmetry and efficiency; height h chosen for balanced stress. Direct connections from each support to peak node and from node_3/peak over web. Links: node_1-node_3, node_3-peak, node_2-peak, node_1-peak, node_2-node_3 (closed).",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Placing a new node above node_3 enables both points of support to contribute to vertical load carrying by distributing reactions, and forms two triangles, improving rigidity and reducing the worst stress. The added height h should not be excessive to avoid increasing mass unnecessarily while also keeping member angle moderate (best between 35-55deg for truss). All members assigned minimal area satisfying stress bound. Mass summed by length × area.",

    "reasoning": "Add single node_4 directly above node_3 at (2.0, h). Connect: node_1-node_3, node_1-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_2-node_3, forming two closed triangles: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_2-node_3-node_4. This grid distributes the -10kN load at node_3 efficiently and symmetrically. Height (h) is chosen as 2.5 for moderate slopes, practically minimizing both mass and stress (member slopes ≈45°). Check stress in referenced critical members and select lowest possible area_id to meet stress limit. Structure is closed and node count is minimal, ensuring low mass.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Let node_4: (2.0, 2.5). Member lengths: node_1-node_3=2.0, node_1-node_4=√((2-0)^2+(2.5-0)^2)=3.20, node_3-node_4=2.5, node_2-node_3=4.0, node_2-node_4=√((6-2)^2+2.5^2)=4.72. Apply load at node_3, perform static equilibrium for joint to estimate critical member forces. Angles ensure load split efficiently among diagonals. Estimate for diagonal: projected load ≈10/√2 leads to force on node_3-node_4 and node_1-node_4. Divide by area to estimate stresses; choose minimal area_id such that stresses ≤30. Sum (length × area) for mass, keep ≤30.",

    "calculation": "Member details:\n- node_1-node_3: L=2.00\n- node_3-node_4: L=2.50\n- node_1-node_4: L=3.20\n- node_2-node_3: L=4.00\n- node_2-node_4: L=4.72\n\nStatic analysis at node_3 (joint): Load splits into diagonals. Each diagonal sees \(10/\sqrt{2}=7.07\)kN.\nStress on diagonal (worst case): For area_id '1' => A=0.195 → σ=7.07/0.195=36.3 (>30). Next, try area_id='2' (A=0.782), σ=7.07/0.782=9.0, well below 30. So, assign area_id='2' to diagonals. Bottom chords (node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3) see lesser force: spread among three supports, estimate max ~4.0 kN. Try area_id='1': σ=4.0/0.195=20.5 (<30). Satisfactory. Mass: diagonals (3.20+2.50+4.72)×0.782 ≈ 8.42, chords (2.00+4.00)×0.195=1.17, total=9.60 (<30). Therefore, no violations. All members referenced unique nodes. Connections fully close geometry. All boundary and instructions satisfied.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "Selected node_4 at (2.00, 2.50) forms two triangles for optimal distribution. All node positions, member connectivity and area assignments minimize the peak stress and preserve mass < 30. Structure is closed, all three original nodes used per problem statement, and all truss constraints enforced. Cross-checked all geometry; no duplicate connections or unconnected nodes.",
