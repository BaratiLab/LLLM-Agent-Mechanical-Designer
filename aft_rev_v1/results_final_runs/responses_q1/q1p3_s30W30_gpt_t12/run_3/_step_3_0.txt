    "preamble": "This task seeks the optimal minimum-stress, constraint-satisfying, closed 2D truss (five nodes, eight members) to support an inclined (-45 degree), -10 kN load at node_3. All design variables and previous generation history are considered, with the objective being lowering max(abs(stress)) while maintaining mass ≤ 30 and individual member stress within ±30.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs show a load at node_3, pinned at node_1, roller at node_2—positions fixed, all constraints currently satisfied. Prevailing solution (iteration 2/25) already yields low (7.45) max stress and mass at 26.2, both feasible. Exploration is still worthwhile since member_3 is closest to max stress. Nodes 1, 2, and 3 are aligned, nodes 4 and 5 above. Generation history: structures with reduced member sizes are lighter but overstressed. Larger above triangles help.",
    
    "analysis": "Member_3 sees max tension (7.45, nearly the structure max). Members_1 and _6 (near load application) are compressive; others exhibit moderate stresses. Typical truss relation between horizontal bottom chord and vertical/diagonal units to transmit loads, avoid excessive force on specific branches. Current design uses heavier top chords & diagonals above node_3; member_8 is notably heavy (~8.54 mass)—likely an oversized tie distributing oblique load. Shifting top nodes 4 and 5 up/over could redistribute forces and reduce max stress. Member cross-sectional area assignments prioritize higher-stress regions (as evident with 3, 2), but some duplicate/supporting members (e.g. members_4,5,7) might be overprovisioned. Mass is close to lower-bound feasible but redundancy could still drop stress margins.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Key: maintain or boost upper structure over load node to enhance triangle heights (= increase lever arms, reduce forces/moments), likely bringing to around 3.0–3.1 in y for top (currently set at 2.75). Reduce mass in low-stress members to limit total mass. Distribution of load from node_3 at -45 deg suggests tension-side diagonals (members_3/7) should absorb more, possibly nudging node_4 slightly left for improved load path, or better height ratio between 3-4 and 4-5.",
    
    "proposal": "Fine-tune top nodes: raise node_4 to (2.0, 3.10), move node_5 to (6.0, 3.10). Reason: This increases overall rigidity and improves vertical lever arms, lessening max stress on highly stressed tensional/diagonal member_3. Slightly reduce cross section of less-loaded members, keep critical regions upwards of '3'. Connectivity/members unchanged but redistribute area ids. This aims for a more uniformly minimized max(abs(stress)), as well as lower stress-to-weight. No new nodes or member topology—optimized geometry and section assignment.",
    
    "reasoning": "1. Raising upper nodes (4,5) enhances truss 'depth,' lowering force in current tensioned elements and reducing stress on the critical member. 2. Any repositioning must maintain single, closed connectivity (no isolated triangles), and must not move supports or load nodes. 3. Smaller areas should be reserved for non-critical or doubly-redundant lateral members. 4. Revised areas: members 3 & 7 retain area '3', critical diagonals 1 and 8 maintain area '3' where most compressive/tensile, all others scale as area '2' (safer margin). Calculated trigonometric Y-difference increases for the key upper members enhancing load distribution.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Equation setups: Update node_4/5 to (2.0, 3.10)/(6.0, 3.10) from (2.0, 2.75)/(6.0, 2.75). Members' lengths adjusted upward accordingly (Δy = +0.35). For each, estimate lengths (Euclidean), mass = L × Area. Previous largest-area members IDs: '3' (1.759), '2' (0.782). Member_8, which crosses the web diagonally, likely needs to stay area '3' due to its high load; members at top chord or shared by nearly parallel/low-stress paths can revert to '2'. Assuming average stress on steep diagonals will fall by ~15% owing to greater top height; critical checks on member_3 and _6.",
    
    "calculation": "New top-chord member nodes are (2.0, 3.10) and (6.0, 3.10). For member_3 [0.0,0.0]→[2.0,3.10] length = sqrt((2)^2+(3.1)^2)=~3.68m. For member_1 (['node_1','node_3']) remains at 2m. For member_4 ([2,3.1]->[6,3.1]): 4.0m. For each, mass recalculated (see area assignments below). Average major-stressed members (most in tension/compression) maintain area '3'; low loads use '2'. Total mass summing: anticipated ≈25.8–26.4 (satisifes LIMIT=30). By shifting node_4, triangle over load node steepens, reducing both diagonal and vertical reaction forces. Therefore anticipated max(abs(stress)) expected to drop to ≈6.1~6.5 (>10% improvement). No novel connections or triangles formed or lost; isolation avoided.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "The emergent configuration stays within mass and stress constraints, preserves closure/rigidity, aligns supports/fixed/load positions per rules. Adjusts only free node coordinates, retaining all load transfer paths. Chosen cross sections give margin given anticipated load through routes. Verified that node positions are distinct, connection topology forces load-spread, and areas are not duplicated inappropriately.",
    
    "stop": "False", # Further optimal fine-tuning may be technically possible, but this iteration reduces expected max(abs(stress)) and maintains all constraints.
