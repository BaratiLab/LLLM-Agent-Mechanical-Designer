Constraints require all nodes be included in a closed structure, with all stress ≤ ±30, and mass ≤ 30, utilizing only specified area IDs and preserving node positions for supports/loads.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: Fasten node_3 (load) safely to the supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller), while ensuring a closed (triangulated) truss. Constraints are tight; limiting overdesign will be key to meeting the mass constraint. The strongest strategy is to triangulate around the load and allow direct load paths to anchors. Initial triangle: node_1 - node_2 - node_3. For better redundancy and stress distribution, add a single high node between supports, forming a second triangle and redundancy.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Structure requires: (1) load transfer via direct paths from node_3 toward both supports; (2) stable form (triangulation). Loads at 10 kN @ -45° at node_3 tend to both pull and push horizontally and vertically. Rigidly supporting this with just three base nodes risks high stress in the bottom chords. By adding an apex node above, we can break forces into smaller components and reduce peak member force, at the expense of a new member (minimal extra mass and improved efficiency). Main failure risks: buckling in compression diagonal(s), high tension in bottom chord if untriangulated.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Observations: Direct triangle (node_1, node_2, node_3) provides bare minimum connectivity but creates long, heavily-loaded bottom chord. An elevated connection point will improve vertical force uptake (from the -45° load), enhancing stress performance by forming two overlap triangles. Recommended new node: above and between node_1 and node_2. Must minimize height for mass, but high enough to help split load. All nodes need forming a closed polygon plus internal diagonals for triangulation.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Add one node within [3.0, h], h > 0, forming two triangles, angled to tradeoff between minimal extra length (mass) and effective force resolution. Place apex symmetrically for stress distribution and recognize load’s diagonal orientation – place apex toward the load\'s vertical projection. Complete the polygon with all nodes participating and add internal bracing. Choose smallest possible adequate section (area_id) per statics and mass equations.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Key set-ups: node_a = (3.0, h), h = 2.0 optimal for truss depth. Members: 1-3, 2-3, 1-2 (base), 1-a, 2-a, 3-a (six, fully triangulated rectangle). Length calculations: base = 6.0, node_1 to a = sqrt(3^2+2^2)=3.61, node_2 to a = 3.61, node_3 to a = sqrt(1^2+2^2)=2.24. Mass=sum(length×area). Load induces compression/tension along triangulated diagonals; analytic estimate: worst members near node_3 (load). Select minimum area_id protecting stress < 30 with expected member forces under basic joint equilibrium. Anticipate use of area_id >= \'3\' (area=1.759) for loaded diagonals; lower for base.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Successive force resolution at node_3 (load): component forces (~7.07 each in x/y), equilibrium at node_3 disperses f(left_diag), f(right_diag), f(vertical). Uprights/diagonals get ~ ~7.07 kN; using area=1.759 → stress = force / area, 7.07/1.759 = 4.02 << 30, so may try smaller. Lowest practical is area_id \'1\' (area=0.195): 7.07/0.195=36.2 > 30, so area_id \'2\' (area=0.782): 7.07/0.782 = 9.05 < 30, safe. Calculate all member masses: sum(length×area).
