The task is to generate a fully closed, optimized 2D truss that both keeps max(abs(stress)) ≤ 30 and total mass ≤ 30, while distributing loads efficiently and preserving node positions at support/load nodes.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max(abs(stress)) ≤ 30, total mass ≤ 30. Current truss is minimally above mass limit and all stresses are well within limit (max 13.56). Further optimization needed on member layout and cross sections. Consider improved topology (e.g., more uniform triangulation) and scrutinize heavy/thick members for lighter options.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Support nodes (pinned/roller) are at (0.0,0.0) and (6.0,0.0). Load of -10.0 at -45° at node_3 (2.0,0.0) results in both downward and leftward component. Previous structures use two levels of interior nodes: top level (e.g., ~[3,3.5]) and lower arches (e.g., [2.1,2.8], [3.9,2.8]). However, adding height (moving top nodes higher) increased the structure\'s mass and instability. In previous history, denser/over-braced triangles escalate weight highly. Failure often comes from either using thin members on critical diagonals, or too much member redundancy and straying from closed triangular mesh. Efficient layout is compact Warren-like truss with double lines at key diagonals. Members with high area were always in compression diagonals right under the load path.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Pattern: Every structure that remains at/under 30 mass stresses remains well below the 30 limit—there is margin there. But hybrid triangulated schemes—placing upper nodes within 2.7–3.0 in y and aligning interior nodes nearly centered—improve economy. Denser upper chords dramatically hike mass. Redundancy to be added only on the direct path of the -45° load. Integration of all nodes into triangles required for being closed. For mass, prefer area_id \'2\' (0.782) for non-critical web or secondary braces, with area_id \'3\' (1.759) on diagonals under main loads. Remove redundancy on bottom chord. At least five upper/lower members of minimum length/area connect all nodes.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign topology to a compact Warren truss/partial triangulated scheme: maintain nodes at (0.0,0.0), (6.0,0.0), (2.0,0.0), (4.0,0.0) on bottom; set top nodes where prior optimization had minimal-weight feasible results but moderate stresses: (~2.7, 2.8) and (~3.3, 2.8). Connect all nodes such that each triangle is closed, every node is joined by at least two members, and critical loadways (from node_3 upward and truss \'webs\') utilize moderate area members only on critical members. Fine tune top node placement (not too tall for weight, not too short for stress spike). Use predominantly \'2\' area for standard members, \'3\' for diagonal braces under main loads.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Compact Warren/triangulated schemes absorb the -45° load with split web members running from loaded node_3 to upper/top-off-chord nodes; these webs are chosen as critical diagonals and benefit from increased cross-section (area_id \'3\', 1.759). The rest remain at \'2\' (0.782), not less, to limit stress spikes. Dedicated bottom chord (node_3-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_3) has symmetric short length, allowing standard area even at minimal weight. Remove excessive arch, maximize triangle depth between load/applications. Selected nodes are justified by the historic best results (members across 2.1–3.9 x positions, 2.8 y, minimal span between web/diagonal). The result should meet both stress and mass objectives.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: e.g., node_5 (2.7,2.8), node_6 (3.3,2.8). Diagonals from node_3 to node_5, node_5-node_6, nodes_6 to node_4 (~2.5 to ~2.9 in length, mult by 0.782~1.759). Complete with light bottom members. Use truss theory for stress path: main compressive from node_3 upwards will require the most area (~1.76), crossings at node_5 to node_4 and node_5 to node_1 may see moderate stress. Preliminary load check: worst-case member max expected along loaded diagonal or bottom horizontal, so design those to take max load (~±13 as in prior result). Webs toward free end can stay \'2\', diagonals from support to top nodes tolerated with \'2\'. Calculate total member mass as sum(lengths × selected area).",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths estimated as: Bottom chord (0-2),(2-4),(4-6): 2.0 each, area=0.782, mass=3*2*0.782=4.692.
