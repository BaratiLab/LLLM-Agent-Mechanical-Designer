The objectives are maximal stress ≤ ±30 (any member), and total truss mass ≤ 30, all while ensuring connectivity and appropriate member sizing.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs provide node locations, loads and supports, current and historic failed truss topologies (due to over-stress or overweight design, despite full connectivity). Constraints are clearly stress and mass; careful load path, geometry, member sizing and triangulation needed to avoid failure. Unconstrained nodes or oversized high-mass members have spoiled past attempts.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current design is a hex-based truss with 6 nodes (planar \'arch\'), but is too heavy (total mass=49.6 > 30) and some members verge on allowable stress (stress up to -9.1). Even the simplest ‘Warren’ type designs in history (5 or less nodes) easily failed max-stress by exceeding ±30 by a large margin, but with reduced mass—indicating current stress/mass amortization is suboptimal, and full triangulated forms with high areas drain the mass budget. A strategic, geometric revision with judicious node elevation for force routing is essential. Notably, member mass is highest where member lengths are greatest (base chords—node_1 to node_2 at 6m). This base span must bear almost all reactions and thus attracts large cross-section if only two members share it, draining mass quota. Most direct improvement pathway: minimize member length by introducing correctly placed nodes (bracing height), promoting efficient load paths by ensuring axial force is primarily channelled in short, triangulated segments. Place node_5 vertically above applied load, so Y-component of F is absorbed axially by short \'tower\'; RS design with tight triangles; lean node_4 and node_2 to concentrate support influence inward, reducing outer chord length to minimum structurally required.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "All prior ultra-lean trusses exceeded stress limits; only heavily triangulated dense frameworks were under allowable stress but at the cost of huge mass. The solution must maximally employ deep triangles and position upper vertices high enough/lateral enough to minimize unbraced spans yet avoid excessive member length. Thus, I will re-use supports (node_1, node_2) and load node location (node_3), add just enough nodes for deep triangulation without extra members, and smartly size members. Keeping node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed satisfies supports/loads per requirements.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign to use lean minimal-truss geometry: Place a single high vertex node (node_5 directly above node_3) for maximum triangle depth (steep arch). Use only the required pinned nodes for a closed circuit, but use as few added nodes as possible to avoid feature (member) explosion. Use 5 nodes: node_1 (0,0 - pinned), node_2 (6,0 - roller), node_3 (first inner edge: 2.0,0), node_4 (4.0,0), node_5: directly above support: (3.0,3.6). (Mid-span height equals about 0.6×half-chord, sufficient for stiffness/load ratio). Full triangulation will run between all bases, the apical upper and directly to the load. Chords and braced diagonals as short as possible. \'Warren\'-like arch with double diagonals over three center sections. Add minimal area for long span chords; thicken diagonals or verticals locally for stress moderation. This confines members to largely the XY plane in strong triangles, capturing both X and Y load reactions and minimizing moment arm.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "The yield/load will pivot about supports. Maximum stress usually accrues in midspan members under significant shear, especially the member bridging loaded node_3 vertically to the \'crown\'. Raising node_5 vertically above node_3 minimizes diagonal compression/tension at a reasonable bracing height while limiting long-member penalties. Proper member sizing leverages King/Warren configuration strengths but tall triangle mitigates member stress even with lighter sections. All nodes participate – no isolated points. No member is undeclared. To provide direct force paths for support reactions to the applied load (at node_3), triangles recombine at the apex, minimizing leeward unsupported elements.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume equilateral triangle geometry in region between node_1 and node_2, but pushing node_5 higher than previously used. Calculate individual member lengths, assign area values (‘2’ or above only where absolutely required; minimize to ‘1’ whenever possible within stress). Sum mass via length × area. For each member, estimate maximum force via resolution with the main point load for the worst-case member, and check allowable stresses vs. chosen area IDs (area_dict provided). Member mass = length × area by area_id; stress (approximate) = force/(area) for main post-load diagonals and chords. Keep base as short as possible but accept pins at support positions.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Basic node structure: node_1:(0,0), node_2:(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(4,0), node_5(3,3.6).

Assume area_id ‘2’ for diagonal/verticals (area=0.782), and ‘1’ for top chords (area=0.195, if practical via calculation without over-stressing). Compute axial force in each by vector projection of -10 kN @ -45°, approximating critical member stresses.
