The overarching objectives are stress minimization under ±30, and ensuring mass ≤30 units. Both equilibrium and efficient force flow must be ensured for maximum strength-to-mass ratio.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs include three collinear base nodes, a downward-and-rightward load on node_3, and pinned and roller supports at node_1 and node_2. Triangulation is fundamental for closure, but with only three collinear nodes, load path is inefficient unless we add an apex (4th) node. Main goals: close the truss by creating at least one triangle, allow direct force flow, minimize overstressing and total area.",\n    \n    "analysis": "With only basal collinear nodes, any direct truss will yield large bending moments/axial forces along the base. The applied force on node_3 at (2,0) acts at an angle, introducing both horizontal and vertical reactions distributed across supports. No actual height in the base nodes implies poor vertical force transfer—solution is to add a single apex node above the base for a triangular arrangement, optimizes by splitting load directly between supports. Member area selection is critical for both high-stress/buckling members and overall weight.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "A stable, optimal solution involves generating a 4th node (apex) at mid-span above node_3, forming two overlapping triangles. This both closes the structure and decreases internal force magnitudes by reducing member length/increasing redundancy. The load applied to node_3 at the base will transfer mainly into the top chord and diagonals. Ensure each member’s estimated stress is within bounds and combined mass under threshold. The area assignment must balance between minimal member area and stress limitations.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "From theory: most efficient truss shapes for a 3-base node, 1 apex configuration are isosceles triangles split about the load. Adding an apex above the base, directly above (or near) node_3 (given load application), allows diagonal members to dissipate vertical/horiz force to supports, reducing maximal member forces. Triangulation inherently stabilizes the frame. Large area assignments are only needed for maximally loaded members (e.g., diagonals), with small base members able to leverage reduced force from geometric advantage.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Set new node_4 atop node_3; let’s allocate a moderate height h above y=0, e.g. h=2m for geometry efficiency and mass control. Each member (support-to-apex, apex-to-mid, etc.) forms a triangle. Enumerate: member_1=node_1-node_3, member_2=node_3-node_2, member_3=node_1-node_4, member_4=node_2-node_4, member_5=node_3-node_4 to provide full closure. Analyze string/truss equilibrium for loads. Calculate member lengths using distance for truss geometry. From the external load, estimate internal axial force using trigonometry for members linking top-down (node_4 diagonals). Using sigma = F/A, ensure area assignment keeps open |σ|≤30 for max-member force, choose minimal area ID from the list, propagate for sparse-stress members (base). Estimate structural mass as total ∑(L_i*A_i), ensuring mass ≤30. If a member approaches critical stress/mass, assign appropriate area_id upward.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Set node_4 at (2.0, 2.0) for symmetry and minimal member length. Calculate member lengths: base (node_1-node_3: 2.0 m, node_3-node_2: 4.0 m), diagonals and verticals using Pythagoras (e.g., node_1 to node_4: sqrt(2^2+2^2)=2.83 m; node_2 to node_4: sqrt(4^2+2^2)=4.47 m; node_3 to node_4: 2.0 m). External load at node_3 is 10 kN (unit). The diagonal from support (node_1/node_2)-apex resists vertical & horizontal shares; by symmetry the central apex supports the vertical, while base resists horizontal. Distribute force for equilibrium. For member_3/member_4 the vertical component is F/2 per support, estimated force in diagonal = (10/(sqrt(2)))≈7.07. Use σ=F/A. For maximum expected force 7.07 and limit σ=30 → minimum A = 7.07/30 ≈ 0.236. Assign area_id \'1\' (A=0.195) is slightly under, so use \'2\' (A=0.782) for major stress diagonals; for base and top (lower force) use smallest area \'1\' or \'0\'. Sum mass for all members and verify limit. Members and connected nodes: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4. All nodes and members are referenced, forming 2 triangles, closing the structure. Verify: all stresses ~7.07/0.782=~9.05 (<<30), mass = 2*0.195+4*0.195+2.83*0.782+4.47*0.782+2*0.782 ≈ 0.39+0.78+2.21+3.49+1.56 = ~8.43 (below 30 mass limit).
