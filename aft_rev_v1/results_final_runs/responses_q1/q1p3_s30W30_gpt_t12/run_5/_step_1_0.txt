    "preamble": "The task is to optimize a 2D truss supporting a -10 kN load at node_3 (2,0), with pinned at node_1 (0,0) and roller at node_2 (6,0). The previous design is a vertical rectangle with a central loaded node (node_3 at (2,0)), resulting in excessive stress (max=60.44>30) and total mass=8.44. The optimization objective is to achieve a closed, connected truss structure with max |stress| ≤ 30 and total mass ≤ 30, while keeping node/support/load assignments fixed and using only permitted area IDs.",
   
    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective is a minimal-stress, mass-efficient closed truss, meeting stress (±30) and mass (≤30) constraints. The initial shape is a near-rectangular frame with an internal vertical and diagonal support but overstressed in major bottom member. All + area ranges are open but should be minimal to reduce mass. Node and load positions at support must remain unchanged.",
    
    "analysis": "Current configuration channels most load through the short central span (node_1—node_3—node_2), where member_1 is overstressed (-60.4). The vertical and diagonal (node_3—node_4) doesn't efficiently triangulate the forces, and there are few load-sharing diagonals or top-chord reinforcements. The upper node (node_4 at (2,2)) helps reduce vertical span but may not share load effectively. The principal failure is that the main bottom chord takes nearly all of the applied load in bending, and the structure lacks secondary bracing preventing full truss action. Design history yields only this initial failed setup.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Key goal: convert frame-like system to fully triangulated truss distributing load. Previous shape failed largely because the direct members to supports were too thin; stress concentrated in bottom chord and diagonals. Closing the upper triangle or adding a top chord will improve load distribution, lowering peak stress. Consider adding an apex node and diagonals, forming two robust triangles around the applied force. Likely require a small area for members under less stress and larger for main chords as needed.",
    
    "proposal": "Redesign to a lightweight, minimal-principal-stress Pratt or simple triangular truss: Keep supports, load, and support nodes fixed. Add a single apex node above the current truss to spread forces into triangles (transforming the shape to a trapezoidal/sawtooth arrangement), and connect all nodes to efficiently distribute vertical and horizontal load components. Optimize area selection to minimize mass.",
    
    "reasoning": "A simple, symmetrical closed truss—triangulated—localizes force at loads and redistributes to supports. By adding a node centrally above the supports (higher than node_4) and connecting apex to all lower nodes, the load can enter multiple members (not just verticals with bending moments). Maintain existing nodes per restrictions but improve member layout and add key triangle node. This classic King Post configuration yields six members: bottom chord, two inclined from supports, and two from lower load node to apex. Confirm member areas based on force directions.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume node_1 at (0,0), node_2 at (6,0), node_3 at (2,0), and node_4 at (4,0) -- shifting prior node_4 horizontally to widen top chord. Add new node_5 (apex) at (3,3). Members: node_1-node_2, node_1-node_5, node_2-node_5, node_3-node_5, node_4-node_5, plus diagonals: node_3-node_4. Choose thicker area_id (id='2' or higher, 0.782+) for highly loaded chords, and id='1' (0.195) for lower force bracing/diagonals; adjust after load-path analysis. Approximate most chord forces using vector resolution and statics. Cross-check mass (length × area) for all members.",
    
    "calculation": "Calculate key node: new apex node_5 at (3,3) (mid-span truss top). Members: Bottom chord (node_1–node_2): L=6 m. Sides: (3,3) to (0,0) and (6,0) are 4.24 m. Internal strut: node_3–node_5 is 3.16 m. Expected: Bottom chord has high compression/tension — needs large enough area. Using area id='2' (A=0.782): bottom chord 6×0.782=4.692. Sides with id='1' (A=0.195): 2×4.24×0.195 =1.654. Vertical/diagonals (id='1'): (3.16 m+2 m)x0.195=1.0. Total ≈ 4.69+1.65+1.0 = 7.34 < 30. Stresses are reduced by triangulation (each takes ½ to ⅓ total load assuming symmetric structure; if peak force hits about max, areas can be tuned upward.) If stress over ±30 (NPC: F/A, under 30 kN over 0.782 ≈ 38 Max; may require area id upsize for the bottom/legs). Tighter tuning can iterate by selecting id='3' (A=1.759) only for bottom chord if needed.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Final check: Triangulated design, node_5 (3,3) newly added (yields two major triangles, force distributed symmetrically). All existing and required nodes preserved with unchanged supports/loads. Chord sized up as required for constraint (area_id='3'/'2', rest are '1'). The structure is fully closed and connected. Members connect all force transfer nodes, forming a robust king-post-style truss—no structurally unlinked points. Use float coordinates directly; all areas use unique IDs as required.",
