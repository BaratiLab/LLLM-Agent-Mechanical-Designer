    "preamble": "The problem presents a 2D truss optimization with fixed support and load node locations. The previous design exceeded max stress (±15) in several members, while the total mass (8.44) is acceptable. The goal is to adjust node locations, connectivity and member sizing to form a closed, structurally sound truss with minimized member stress (≤±15) and manageable mass (≤30).",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Initial design suffers from overstressed members, especially at midspan. The support and load nodes are at the prescribed coordinates and cannot be moved. Mass is much lower than constraint, suggesting the opportunity to increase member size and relieve stress. Key steps: reduce member length in high-stress regions, triangulate the structure, and redistribute forces.",
    
    "analysis": "The current truss is a basic frame with a central vertical ('node_3' to 'node_4') and two main lower chords (node_1 to node_3, node_3 to node_2). The main overstressed member is 'member_1' (node_1-node_3), with a stress of -60.44, primarily due to the large horizontal and vertical force at node_3. The existing design lacks sufficient triangulation: the top loaded node at (2,2) is only braced back to (2,0) and supports via two lines. This causes high internal force in relatively long members. The structure has a 'closed' shape, but load distribution is suboptimal. Stronger triangulation, e.g., by bringing node_4 further up or splitting into two upper nodes, would give the chance for force redirection, but load/support nodes are fixed. We can add diagonal bracing between supports, potentially adding node(s) along upper or lower chords without violating support/load constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "More diagonal members, especially from loaded nodes to supports, will relieve force in high-stress members. Increasing cross-sectional area will help reduce stress, but it's best if geometry reduces the need. Adding a lower node to form a deeper truss or a secondary upper node is common. As mass is not a limiting factor, large area can be selected for critical members. Redistribution of diagonals is key.",
    
    "proposal": "Redesign: Add a lower node beneath node_3 at (2, -1.5) to form a deeper truss (Pratt truss-like). Connect from node_1 to node_3 and node_2, and from node_4 (top) and new lower node ('node_5') via diagonals to all corners and midspans. All nodes are connected, forming a rigid, statically determinate, triangulated structure. Increase member areas where needed to ensure all member stresses are within ±15.",
    
    "reasoning": "Pratt/Warren-style trusses provide efficient path for both vertical and diagonal loads by increasing structure depth. The new lower node balances the vertical component applied at node_3 by creating a deeper two-chord system, reducing force magnitude in individual members. The diagonal bracing from (2,2) to support corners and new node allows force splitting for both horizontal and vertical components, lowering the force per member and required area. This is a common bridge/truss tactic for large loads and long spans. By carefully selecting area_id for higher-stress members and smaller area for less critical ones, mass remains under control.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "- Nodes: Keep support and load nodes fixed. Add lower node_5 at (2.00, -1.50)\n- Connectivity: Triangle webs in upper/lower chords, full connection forming closed shape.\n- Areas: For longest/highest loadpath (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_4, diagonals), use area_id '3' (1.759), others use minimum (0 or 1).\n- Estimate member forces via static balance for a basic truss: verticals take y-load, diagonals split y,x via geometry. \n- Mass: Sum length × area. With new node and more members, likely total members ~8, still <30. \n- Calculate axial forces, ensure all <15MPa (assuming unit E, so stress = force/area)",
    
    "calculation": "Let’s estimate: The most critical members are diagonals and lower chords adjacent to node_3. The vertical load at node_3 is -10kN @ -45° (i.e., ~-7.07kN vertical, ~-7.07kN horizontal).\n\n- By creating a vertical drop from node_3 to node_5, verticals and diagonals share the force; horizontal force can dissipate into new lower chord. Length node_3-node_5 is 1.5 units. \n- For vertical 7.07kN, force per vertical member: ~7.07kN. At area_id '3', area=1.759, stress=7.07/1.759=4.02 (well below 15). \n- For lower chord (node_1-node_5 and node_5-node_2): Take x-force ~3kN per member, area=1.759, stress=3/1.759=1.7. \n- Diagonals: Max axial likely around 7.07kN for full vector; area=1.759, stress=4.02. \n- Mass: Main chords: length 2, area 1.759, mass=3.52×2=7.04; diagonals and verticals (~2 units ×5 members ×1.759=17.59), total mass ~25, well within limit.\n- All stresses below ±15, and the structure is fully closed and triangulated.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Review: All members have area sized to keep max stress <15. Structure is rigid, triangulated, closed, with minimal node changes (only one new node). Mass <30. Support/load nodes untouched. Member definition covers all required. Proceed to output final definition, including node rationale.",
