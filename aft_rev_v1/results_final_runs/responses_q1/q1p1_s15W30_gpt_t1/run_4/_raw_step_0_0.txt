Three nodes and a single point load are provided, with pinned and roller supports. The aim is to generate a fully connected, triangulated truss minimizing both maximum member stress (within ±15) and total mass (≤30). Cross-sectional areas must be selected from a discrete set. The solution introduces one auxiliary (internal) node to enable triangulation and ensure a robust, closed connection between all nodes.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes: 3 input nodes (0,0), (6,0), (2,0); Load: -10 at 45° down/right on node_3; Supports: node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). A basic triangle is possible, but load direction indicates that simple bottom-chord connectivity exposes members to high stress. Triangulation needed for stability and to reduce per-member force.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Load on node_3 (2,0) points downward/rightward at -45°, meaning both x and y reactions needed. Supports at (0,0) and (6,0) make for a bottom chord, but with only three nodes, diagonals can only form a simple triangle. However, that will create high member stress due to limited load path diversity. Introducing an internal node above node_3 (e.g., at (2,2)) allows force triangulation while keeping mass low and respecting constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The triangle between the base nodes and (2,0) alone likely isn\'t enough to keep stress under 15 under a 10kN diagonal load with slender members and mass constraint. An internal top node will greatly reduce stress via shorter load paths and supports direct load transfer.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By introducing a node at (2,2), forming two triangles (with (0,0)-(2,0)-(2,2) and (2,0)-(6,0)-(2,2)), we allow the vertical load at node_3 to be split efficiently. Members will be chosen with minimum sufficient area for stress constraint and low mass. All members connect directly, forming a closed, triangulated structure. This enables efficient force distribution, keeps stresses well below limit, and allows for a light structure.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume steel and unit density for simplicity. Calculate force at each member, assuming equilibrium at (2,0): load components Fx = Fy = -7.07 each. Internal node at (2,2) splits load. Members: (0,0)-(2,0), (2,0)-(6,0), (2,0)-(2,2), (0,0)-(2,2), (2,2)-(6,0). Key: each triangle stabilizes the top and resists out-of-plane buckling. Select area_id for each member such that max force/area ≤ 15 and total mass ≤ 30. Estimate member lengths, forces, stress, then iterate area selections.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: L1 (0,0)-(2,0)=2.00; L2 (2,0)-(6,0)=4.00; L3 (2,0)-(2,2)=2.00; L4 (0,0)-(2,2)=2.83; L5 (2,2)-(6,0)=4.47. Approximate forces using virtual work/equilibrium and typical truss solutions: internal members most loaded (especially (2,0)-(2,2), (2,2)-(6,0)). Assign area_id \'1\' (0.195) to lower-stress members (bottom chord), and area_id \'2\' (0.782) or \'3\' (1.759) to higher-stress diagonals. Trial: L4 (2.83)*0.782=2.21, L5 (4.47)*0.782=3.49, remaining members combine for ~1.17 mass. Total ~6.87 << 30. Member with highest load at (2,0)-(2,2); force is about half the applied (7.07kN). For area 0.782, stress is ~9.05, safely below 15. Confirm all other member stresses also well below 15; if not, increase area_id for any over-stressed member until all constraints are satisfied and mass within limit.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Final design: 4 nodes (3 original + 1 at (2.00,2.00)), 5 members.
