    "preamble": "Objective: Redesign a 2D truss to ensure max |stress| ≤ 15 and total mass ≤ 30, given boundary and load conditions. The latest structure exceeded stress limits, thus constraint-satisfaction is prioritized. The truss must be fully connected and efficient.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: |stress| ≤ 15, mass ≤ 30. Current structure mass (13.99) is fine, but member_3 stress (50.8) grossly violates stress. Loads, supports, and node locations for supports/loads are fixed. Goal: distribute loads via triangulation, use thicker members where needed, and improve load path continuity. Use efficient area sizes for minimal but compliant mass.",
    
    "analysis": "Current trusses with smaller members (area_id='1', '2') yield low mass but very high stresses where forces concentrate (esp. near load application and verticals). Historic attempts at heavy bracing/large sections reduce stress but mass exceeds 24–30. Approaches with large vertical offsets (like arch or high triangle) ‘smear’ load paths and reduce local stress, at the expense of increasing member count and some redundant members. An efficient, closed, slightly arched truss with diagonal bracing and thicker main members appears to provide lowest maximum stress for acceptable mass. Historic best is rank_1 (max stress 15.0, mass 24.1) — but with perhaps too much redundancy/mass.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Areas near the applied load (node_3) need the stiffest sections, especially for transfer to supports. Historic structures with elongated top/bottom chords and diagonals in triangulated (Pratt or Warren) schemes perform better by spreading the load, reducing max member stress, and limiting mass growth. Excessive vertical offset also adds unnecessary member lengths. The best prior solution nearly satisfies constraints (max stress at 15). Re-using such topology, but tightening cross-sections, may further reduce mass while keeping max stress just below 15.",
    
    "proposal": "Redesign as a six-node, double-triangle (Pratt/Warren hybrid) closed truss with two arching top nodes placed above node_1 and node_2, forming two large triangles for efficient load transfer, and vertical/diagonal bracing for closure. Assign area_id='2' or '3' to main diagonal and highly stressed vertical members; use area_id='1' for less-stressed diagonals and chords. Set node_4 above node_1 (left top), node_6 above node_2 (right top), node_5 above load node (mid top); triangulate between bottom nodes, top nodes, and mid-level. All nodes fully connected — no single links.",
    
    "reasoning": "Triangulation minimizes determinacy and ensures redundancy. Raising node_4 and node_6 above supports efficiently spreads reactions. Node_5 above node_3 allows vertical load to transfer across shortest possible struts. Main diagonal members (chords+verticals) must be sized for max expected direct force. Use symmetry to minimize torsion and uneven load distribution. Avoid excessive vertical lift on top nodes to control member length (and mass). Place nodes to create triangles with side lengths close to panel width, which is efficient for common truss forms. Main load path: node_3→node_5→node_4/node_6→supports.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Key assumptions: Main stress in top/diagonals and vertical under load. Use area_id='3'(1.759) for high-stress vertical; area_id='2'(0.782)elsewhere. Set node_4 at (1.2,1.4), node_5 at (3.0,1.6), node_6 at (4.8,1.4), matching a modestly arched profile. Connections: bottom chord (node_1-3-2), top chord (node_4-5-6), verticals (node_3-5), diagonals (node_1-4, node_2-6, node_3-4, node_3-6, node_4-6). Statically, expect load at node_3 shared by vertical & diagonals. Estimate member forces via method of sections/joints. Use lengths and area for mass.",
    
    "calculation": "Estimate lengths: bottom (2.0+4.0=6.0), top ((1.8)+(1.8)=3.6), vertical (1.6), diagonals (~2.33-2.36). Assign areas: vertical under node_3 (max force, area_id='3'), others (area_id='2'). Member force at vertical likely ~load (10), distribute per cosine angles to diagonals. Calculate max stress: P/A, e.g. for highest member ~10/1.759=5.68. Lower than max allowed (15). Total mass: sum(L×A) ≈ (6.0+3.6+1.6+2×2.33+2×2.36)×area, total area sum with assigned values is below 30. All nodes connected.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Truss now closed, fully connected, all nodes with at least two connections. Maximum member stress (in vertical) estimated well below 15. Chord and diagonal stresses (in area_id='2') comfortably lower. Total structure mass with assigned areas under 30. Structure avoids duplication and follows load path logic. Ready to present structure.",
