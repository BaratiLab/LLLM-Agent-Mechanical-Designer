Previous structures failed the max stress (|σ| ≤ 15) and mass (≤30) constraints. The objective is to redesign the truss to minimize internal stresses and weight, while satisfying closure, using only allowed cross-sectional areas. Node positions for applied loads/supports are fixed; other positions may be optimized.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Key constraints: member |stress| ≤ 15, total mass ≤ 30, all nodes structurally integrated, and truss closed. Loads: 10kN at node_3 at -45°, pinned support at node_1 [0,0], roller at node_2 [6,0]. Area choices are quantized. Prior designs exceeded stress (up to 28.5) or mass (34.8), often with excessive internal force in diagonal or top chord. Need better triangulation to distribute load and smaller member areas where possible.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current and historic designs use a several-noded, polygonal truss with intermediate nodes (nodes_4,5,6) to provide an upper chord, but have either excessive diagonal chord stress or redundant members increasing mass. The highest stress member was a short diagonal (member_9 in the latest design: |σ|=28.5). Historical structures with fewer nodes showed lower mass (as low as 10.9), but always exceeded the stress limit. Problem: applied force at node_3 and long span between supports cause high force concentrations. Limiting large loading angles and maximizing triangles spanning between node_3 and upper nodes is likely to distribute axial force more efficiently. Using uniform mid-span height (parabolic or trapezoid upper chord) and connecting all upper/lower nodes using minimal triangulation could reduce stress. Also, using minimum sufficient area (area_id \'2\', A=0.782 or \'3\', A=1.759) for critical members would help keep mass under 30.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: peak stresses occur in diagonals connecting side or upper nodes to node_3. Structural failure localizes at mid-height/diagonal. Attempts to add weight with small-area triangulating members in upper zone exceed mass. Lowering top chord node heights or pulling upper nodes closer horizontally to node_3 could reduce lever arm and distribute force. Redundant short diagonals should be minimized. Layout direction: favor symmetric triangular upper regions, triangulate loading point to both supports using the minimal member set.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss for a compact, closed, minimal-mass, high-stiffness structure: triangle beneath the load, minimal polygonal upper chord, and full triangulation between all nodes. Use node_4 directly above node_3 to create a classic warren or Howe truss, maintaining minimal member count (6 nodes), distributing load symmetrically to both supports. Reduce the height of upper nodes to 1.3–1.5 units to decrease force leverage. Use reduced area sections for less-stressed outer chords/diagonals, and moderate areas for diagonals near loaded node.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Adopt a truss geometry with three lower nodes (supports+load point) and three upper nodes, with the upper nodes slightly offset from directly above lower nodes to create two symmetric triangles reaching over node_3. Connect all top nodes to lower nodes to form a closed shape with effective triangulation. This will split the inclined force efficiently and lower peak stresses on any single member. For mass efficiency, select area_id \'2\' (A=0.782) for most members, increasing to \'3\' or \'4\' only for the two main diagonals carrying the brunt of the inclined force. This should reduce both the stress in critical members and total mass below 30.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Axial-force-only truss, nodes are pin-connected, neglecting self-weight. Members sized for max force from load node_3: F = 10 kN at -45°, decomposed Fx=Fy=~7.07kN. Use virtual work or force balance at joint 3 and along diagonals. Upper chord at y≈1.3 relieves lever. Will estimate member forces using statics – main diagonals from node_3 to each upper node carry much of the force, but also rely on direct horizontal and vertical chords for stress sharing. Compute lengths of each member; sum length × area for total mass. Area at main diagonals set to area_id=\'3\' or \'4\', rest at area_id=\'2\'. All nodes connected—truss is closed.",\n\n    "calculation": "Nodes: node_1 [0.0, 0.0] (pinned), node_2 [6.0, 0.0] (roller), node_3 [2.0, 0.0] (load). Upper nodes: node_4 [1.2, 1.3], node_5 [3.0, 1.5], node_6 [4.7, 1.3]. Connectivity: triangles from each support up to upper nodes and down to node_3, plus horizontal and top chords. Estimated member forces: diagonals from node_3 to node_4 and node_5 take ~7kN, with main top and bottom chords ~3-5kN. Areas: diagonals/near-load set to \'3\' (1.759), all other to \'2\' (0.782). Lengths: bottom ~2.0/2.7/2.0, top ~1.8/1.7, diagonals ~1.7–2.5. Mass sum expected ~18–24. Max stress for each diagonal F/A ≈ 7.1/1.759 ≈ 4-5, well within |σ| ≤ 15.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Verify: All lower and upper nodes connected; each support has a load path to the load; all triangles closed, with no isolated nodes. All node coordinates precise (2 decimals). All members defined, no duplications. Estimated max stress under 7.5. Mass sum (with area and length) comfortably under 30.
