    "preamble" : "Design an optimal 2D truss using given nodes and section areas, ensuring all nodes are connected in a closed and efficient structure. Must support a -10 kN, 45° load at node_3, pinned and roller supports, with max |stress| ≤ 15 and mass ≤ 30.",

    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes given: node_1 (0,0) pinned, node_2 (6,0) roller, node_3 (2,0) loaded at -10kN, -45°. Objective: closed, lightweight, low-stress truss. Must likely triangulate and add a new node for statical determinacy and efficient force transfer.",

    "analysis": "Load at node_3 is downward and leftward. Triangulation is crucial. Direct members from supports to node_3 handle the load. A fourth, elevated node above node_3 enables triangulation and a closed structure. Placing node_4 at (3.0,2.2) (mid-span, above), forms an efficient triangle with all nodes interconnected. This configuration minimizes member length and directs forces optimally to supports. Potential member forces can be resolved through geometry.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "High load at node_3 needs to be split between node_1 and node_2. Adding node_4 (elevated) above the span forms two triangles, improving stiffness and reducing peak stresses. Members (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), (node_2-node_4), (node_4-node_1), (node_3-node_4) provide redundancy and meet closed truss requirement with minimum redundancy.",

    "reasoning": "New node_4 at (3.0,2.2) is optimal: (1) symmetry about the x-axis for balanced load path, (2) triangulation for structural efficiency, (3) minimum additional material for closure. All nodes now connected in a closed loop, enabling effective force transfer and stress minimization. Diagonal node_3-node_4 picks up vertical and horizontal load components, reducing demand on horizontal base members.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Member list: (1-3), (3-2), (2-4), (4-1), (3-4). Compute member lengths. Estimate member forces via method of joints (approximate, as statically determinate). Mass=sum(length*area). Assign lowest possible area_id to satisfy stress constraint |force/area|≤15. Compute total mass, adjust area_id upwards if stress bound violated. Aim for mass<<30.",

    "calculation": "Member lengths (rounded to 2 decimals):\n- node_1-node_3: sqrt(4^2 + 0^2) = 4.00\n- node_3-node_2: sqrt(4^2 + 0^2) = 4.00\n- node_1-node_4: sqrt(3^2+2.2^2) ≈ 3.72\n- node_2-node_4: sqrt(3^2+2.2^2)=3.72\n- node_3-node_4: sqrt(1^2+2.2^2)=2.42\nForce estimates: \n- Load at node_3 splits to node_1, node_2, node_4.\n- Members node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2 carry main horizontal load. Members to node_4 resist vertical and balance forces.\nAssign area_id '1' (area=0.195 for diagonals), '2' (area=0.782) for base members. Estimate max force at ~7 kN (dispersion by statics). Stress=7/0.195=~36 for area_id‘1’, so too high; for area_id '2' (0.782), 7/0.782=8.96.\n\nAssign area_id '2' (0.782) to all non-base members, area_id '3' (1.759) for base members to stay conservative. Compute mass:\n- base members: 2*4.00*1.759=14.07\n- side/diagonals: (3*3.72 + 2.42)*0.782=11.01\n- total mass ≈ 14.07+11.01=25.08 < 30\nEstimated max stress = ~9 < 15. Constraints satisfied.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "Design is triangulated, all nodes in closed structure. Max stress estimate < 15, mass ≈ 25.1 < 30. Chosen member area_ids minimize mass while maintaining safety. No duplicate connections, all member references are unique nodes only.",
