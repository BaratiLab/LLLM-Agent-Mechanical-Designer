The objective is to create a closed, mass-efficient structure with max(abs(stress)) ≤ 15 and total mass ≤ 30, using only prescribed area choices.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Main goals: bring stress under 15 (currently max is 59.29), total mass should not exceed 30, and ensure no isolated nodes. The current and past structures are all over-stressed; most have limited triangulation and undersized member areas near the main load node.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The main challenge is the high applied load at node_3. Existing structures exhibit excessive stress in lower-chord members and insufficient triangulation. Most historic designs solve the mass constraint but can\'t contain stress, due to shallow triangles and small member areas on key load paths. The highest stress usually localizes in compressed/tensioned top/bottom chord members. More triangles (especially above node_3) usually lower stress but cost mass. Some historic structures add upper chords and support nodes but result in heavy, inefficient designs. The lightest past truss (10.7 kg) still had 59 MPa max stress. Increasing member areas indiscriminately is inefficient. Positioning nodes to make triangles steeper (taller) better distributes loads.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "High stress always shows up in the lower chord near node_3; mass is not the dominant problem, stress is. Past structures fell short by having almost all members in area 2 (0.782), so I\'ll need to increase key member areas only where necessary. Structural efficiency demands triangulation focusing on node_3 and a stiffer upper chord.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign: Use a Pratt truss-inspired layout, keeping existing supports and loaded node stationary. Add a new upper node (node_5) above node_3 to better split and redirect the diagonal force, a node near mid-span (node_6), and connect all with diagonals and chords. Use area_id 4 (3.128) for bottom chords at high-stress locations, area_id 2 (0.782) or 1 (0.195) for mid/upper portions. All nodes will be interconnected. Aim for fewer but more effective members—efficient triangulation and sizing.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Tall triangles over the loaded node help provide vertical stiffness without excessive length. The lowest chord between supports will be sized up (area_id \'4\'). Diagonals from node_3 to top and from midnodes to supports will provide redundancy. Connect all top/bottom chords and diagonals so no node is isolated. Support nodes or node_3 will not be moved, per constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Add nodes: node_5 (over node_3), node_6 (mid-top between node_1 and node_5). Use statics: member force in bottom chord ≈ applied force/2 (vertical balance, as both supports are used), so pick area such that stress = F/A ≤ 15 ⇒ A ≥ 10,000/15 = 666.7 N/mm²—or in kN, A ≥ 0.6667 for each highly loaded member. Thus, area_id 4 (3.128) is more than sufficient. For diagonals at 45°, force=10/sqrt(2)≈7.07, so area_id 2 or 1 may suffice. Calculate lengths, sum up total mass (mass = length * area). Chosen node elevations (heights) will maximize vertical load sharing.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Let’s estimate members: \\n- node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_5 (2,2.5), node_6 (4,2.5).
