The current and historic designs have repeatedly violated the ±15 allowable stress constraint. Objective: deliver a closed, efficient truss meeting all constraints, especially stress and mass limits.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller), node_3 is loaded with (-10, -45°), and node locations are fixed except for additional nodes. Constraints: max|stress| ≤15, total mass ≤30. Structural closure required. Previous designs failed mainly from excessive axial stress in members connecting node_4, suggesting load paths are too direct or triangles are ill-configured.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current and past trusses have a tendency to develop very high stresses, usually in one or two top chords connected to node_3 and node_4. All designs in history exceeded the max allowable stress, whether dense or sparse triangulation was used, and in some, the top member(s) take the full load imparted at node_3. There is a lack of sufficient triangulation around the loaded node and insufficient alternative load paths. Mass is not limiting. Node_3\'s eccentric load is creating high moments, addressed inadequately by single panels. Improved load diffusion via more strategic node placement above node_3 or subdivision of members may reduce stress. Member cross-sections so far have been mostly area_id \'2\'; higher areas only slightly improved stresses but increased mass sharply. The truss boundary (0,0)-(6,0)-(4.0,2.5)-(2.0,2.5) is under-exploited, and more triangular bracing above node_3 likely beneficial.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Stress excess mainly occurs in members linking node_3 to the upper chords. Dense diagonal bracing between all top and bottom nodes should create redundant paths to dissipate this. Adding a node at (3.0,2.5) splits the span and breaks up critical member length. Revising node_4 higher and adding a new node (mid-span above node_3) increases force redirection. Triangles subdividing the upper panel and distributing node_3\'s load into two upper chords typically lower maximum stress (Warren-type truss). Use of area_id \'3\' or \'4\' for highly loaded members and \'2\' for others is appropriate.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign from current with added node above mid-span to better distribute node_3\'s load. Connect all top and bottom nodes by diagonals for classic triangular closure—yielding a Warren truss with an extra top node. Slightly raise node_4 and introduce node_5 at (3.0,2.5). Member sizing: largest area in members expected to take biggest load; area_id \'3\' or \'4\' for diagonals/top chords, area_id \'2\' for verticals/less critical chords. All nodes will remain interconnected; no isolations. Keep nodes at support and loaded locations to preserve constraints.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulated Warren truss forms are ideal for distributing oblique loads. By splitting the top chord and spreading the load at node_3 between two triangles going to a new node_5 at (3.0,2.5), stress is kept below that in any single member. Larger-area members are focused where FEA or statics say load is greatest, as per prior results. Ensuring all members contribute (avoiding direct, unbraced spans) avoids concentrated force paths. All nodes, especially new ones, must anchor with at least two triangles to avoid excessive local deflection.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Area selections: area_id \'2\' (0.782) for primary members, \'4\' (3.128) for highest force. Force in diagonals under oblique load: for θ = 45°, vertical and horizontal projections split the load, so diagonals carry load at about P/sin(θ/2). Sizing node positions: node_4 at (4.5,2.0), node_5 at (3.0,2.5), and node_6 at (1.5,2.0) yields even triangle divisions. Mass calculation: sum(length × area) for all members. Check that no member exceeds 15 MPa stress under assumed axial force split. Verify redundancy—ensure both structural closure and triangulation, so no node is isolated.",\n    \n    "calculation": "1. Place new top nodes: node_4 (4.5,2.0), node_5 (3.0,2.5), node_6 (1.5,2.0). Connections—bottom chord: node_1-node_3-node_2; top chord: node_6-node_5-node_4; diagonals: node_1-node_6, node_3-node_5, node_2-node_4. Verticals: node_3-node_5. All top nodes interconnected. Calculate member length using distance formula. Each member\'s stress estimated by dividing external force via statics: external load at node_3 shared into adjacent diagonals/vertical. Assume ≈50% force per main diagonal—so 7.1 units per diagonal, max stress = F/A = 7.1/3.128 ≈ 2.27 for area \'4\' and 7.1/0.782 ≈ 9.08 for \'2\', all less than 15. Sum mass: all lengths × area. Design is closed, efficiently triangulated, mass low.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "All nodes interconnected; all have at least two incident members. No member unconnected. Member areas properly matched to force demands. Stress is kept below 15 by splitting load and strengthening main diagonals. Mass expected to be under 20. Node coordinates have at least 1e-2 precision and are not rounded to integers or snapped.
