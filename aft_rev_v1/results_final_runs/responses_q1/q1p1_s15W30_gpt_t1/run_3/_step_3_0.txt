    "preamble": "The task is to optimize a planar 2D truss with specified supports and applied loads. The present and historical designs violate the maximum stress constraint (|stress| > 15 MPa), though total mass is within acceptable limits. The objective is to generate a closed truss structure that meets all constraints (|stress| ≤ 15, mass ≤ 30), while efficiently transmitting the external load and remaining structurally robust.",

    "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives: keep |stress| ≤ 15 MPa and total mass ≤ 30; ensure all nodes (including supports and loaded node) are interconnected; prioritizing closure and triangulation. Key supports are at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). The only load is at node_3. Previous attempts either stressed a diagonal or used a non-optimal, member-heavy design. Plan: analyze geometry, then refine both member count and cross-sections.",

    "analysis": "Current and historic designs use five to six nodes, triangulated in various ways, but all fail due to excessive stress in diagonals (notably ~27 MPa in a short member near node_4 and node_6). The external force on node_3 acts at -45°, generating both X and Y reaction components that must be resolved mainly at the supports. Prior designs (esp. constraint_not_met_3) focus force through a high-stress vertical member, suggesting that diagonal bracing isn't carrying their share. Topology also sometimes creates over-long or minimally-braced panels. For optimality, triangulation and direct load paths between loaded and supported nodes are crucial.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Stress concentration is repeatedly observed in a diagonal/vertical (member_6 in previous designs), typically under-dimensioned or too long. The geometry lacks direct load paths or has weak triangles. A compact, symmetric truss with a top-chord node above node_3 (leveraging the load application location), and two upper nodes over supports (nodes_4, _5) can collect and efficiently distribute loads. Members between supports, midspan (node_3), and a new top node would keep stress in check. Consider reducing height slightly for better force distribution and sizing critical members with minimum mass for |stress|<15.",

    "proposal": "Redesign: shift to a five-node, symmetric Pratt/Warren type truss. Keep node_1, node_2, and node_3 at supports/midspan. Place a single upper chord node (node_4) directly above node_3 and two top nodes over each support (nodes_5, _6). Connect all as triangles, optimize vertical and diagonal lengths to balance force resolution (especially for -45° loading). Assign larger area (id='2'/'3' for bottom/critical members), size diagonals/others with '1' where possible. Rationale: this layout invites force truss action, minimizes moment arms, and ensures closure.",

    "reasoning": "A Warren/Pratt (or Howe) truss configuration is ideal for simply supported, symmetrically loaded spans. By raising node_4 above midspan, we allow vertical and diagonal members to participate in withstanding the applied oblique force at node_3, distributing stress. Both top and bottom chords, plus diagonal bracing from loaded node_3 to the top and supports, enable direct load paths and help keep stresses ≤ 15 MPa. Triangulation ensures closure and prevents mechanism behavior. Sizing is picked to match stress/mass constraints, especially for loaded/critical members.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Planned setup: node_1 (0,0) pinned, node_2 (6,0) roller, node_3 (2,0) loaded. Place node_4 at (3,2.0), centered/spanned high, maximizing vertical for efficient force split (assume truss height to ~2.00 m for efficient stress). Nodes_5,6 are not strictly necessary; use just node_4 as elevated apex plus all triangles. Member plan: base (node_1–node_3–node_2), diagonals from node_3 to node_4 (apex) and from node_1 and node_2 to node_4. All members close to equal length ~3–3.6m, diagonals. Estimate maximum force per member given applied load magnitude/projection at -45° (Fx = Fy = -7.07 kN at node_3), so F_member = 10 kN / sqrt(2), and area for each as Area = |Force|/(allowable_stress). For allowable_STRESS=15: Area_min = 0.71. Use area_id='2' for main ties; area_id='1' for others.",

    "calculation": "Member force from load (node_3, -45°): F_x = F_y = -7.07 kN. Distributing via three-member convergence at node_3: diagonals and chord. Each absorbs up to ~7.07 kN (for safety, size chords for full tension/compression). So, for stress 15 MPa: area_needed = 7.07/15 ≈ 0.47; choose next available = 0.782 (area_id='2'). Top and diagonal members may have lower forces; sizing with area_id='1' (0.195) if confirmed by calculation. Mass: each member length (e.g., diagonals from (0,0)-(3,2), sqrt(3^2+2^2)=3.61 m), so five members average 3.2m × 0.782 = ~12.5kg, well below 30kg. Check closure: all five members form two triangles: [node_1, node_3, node_4], [node_2, node_3, node_4], plus base and diagonals.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "Design achieves closure and triangulation, sizes main force-carrying members for stress ≤ 15 MPa, and mass is below 30. All nodes are connected – either to supports or the apex (vertical/diagonal force transmission assured). Final check: members are direct, critical loads shared, closure is present, cross-sections are chosen per allowable stress. No constraint violations expected.",
