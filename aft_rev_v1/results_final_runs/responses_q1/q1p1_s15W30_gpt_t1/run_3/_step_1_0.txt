    "preamble": "The problem is to optimize a small closed 2D truss with 4 nodes, 6 initial members, 1 pinned and 1 roller support, and a single applied load. The current structure is overstressed (|max_stress| = 40.32 > 15) and is not feasible. The goal is to reorganize or redesign the truss to ensure no member exceeds ±15 stress, with total mass remaining under 30, all while providing structural closure and connectivity.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Iterating from an overstressed Warren-type truss with one load at node_3. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). All nodes are on a straight baseline except node_4. Need to redistribute forces to reduce stress concentrations, especially in diagonals, and possibly alter area assignments or topology.",
    
    "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-10kN at -45°) generates significant force in diagonals and members joining to node_4 (notably member_4 and member_6, which are over ±38). The current topology uses moderate-length diagonals and a shallow top chord. The structure is not deep enough, leading to high axial force. Stress is particularly excessive in diagonals, despite modest member cross-sections (area_id '1' for some diagonals). The base members' areas ('2') are viable. Generation history shows only a constraint violation and no alternate topologies; thus, an improved geometry or a stiffer triangulation is necessary.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Key patterns: Overstress linked mainly to the shallow top chord and diagonal geometry; insufficient triangulation depth and small area in diagonals. Efficiency could be improved by making the truss deeper (raising node_4), possibly adding a center top node for a statically-determinate Pratt truss, and increasing diagonal member areas only where needed.",
    
    "proposal": "Redesign the structure as a Pratt-type truss, introducing one additional node (node_5) above the midpoint for greater height, and building two triangles per span. Maintain node_1–node_3–node_2 base. Connect all upper nodes to all lower nodes for multiple load paths. Increase area_id on diagonals most likely to be critical. Keep design closed and all nodes connected.",
    
    "reasoning": "Increasing the truss height (raising the top chord nodes) improves force distribution: reduces stress in diagonals and spreads the vertical load more efficiently. Using triangulation with verticals and diagonals (Pratt topology) allows more members to participate in the load path. Assign largest areas to highest stress members (diagonals near load), smaller areas on less loaded members.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume load at node_3 (2, 0) is split to upper chord through diagonals. Add node_5 directly above node_3 at (2, 1.8) – height derived for effective force reduction and minimal increase in mass. Members: base (node_1–node_3, node_3–node_2), verticals (node_3–node_5), diagonals (node_1–node_5, node_2–node_5), and top chord (node_4–node_5). Assign area_id='2' (A=0.782) to major loaded members, '1' or '0' to lightest. Estimate forces with trigonometry: vertical height increases reduces maximum member force by ~truss height/base span. Set truss height h≈1.8 for a 3/2 reduction in force.",
    
    "calculation": "Geometry: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (4,1.8), node_5 (2,1.8). Members: 'node_1'-'node_3', 'node_3'-'node_2', 'node_1'-'node_5', 'node_3'-'node_5', 'node_5'-'node_4', 'node_2'-'node_4'. Estimate member forces by resolving joint equilibrium at node_3/5; max force in vertical is approx load magnitude (10kN), so stress = F/A ≤ 10/0.782 ≈ 12.8 < 15. All other members expected to carry less due to redundancy. Calculate lengths, assign areas to minimize mass and ensure all are within yield. Preliminary calc: base (2m, 4m); height (1.8m); diagonals ~2.70m. Likely total mass: ≈(2+4)*0.782 + 2*2.7*0.782 + 2*2.37*0.195 ≈ 4.69 + 4.22 + 0.92 ≈ 9.83 < 30. All stress estimates below 15.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Geometry closes, all nodes connected. Cross-sections sized for stress ≤15. Mass well under 30. Structure is statically determinate, stable, and robust to the off-center load. Ready to present final structure.",
