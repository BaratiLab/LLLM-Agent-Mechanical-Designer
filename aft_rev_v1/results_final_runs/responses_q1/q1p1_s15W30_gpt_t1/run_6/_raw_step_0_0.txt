Member areas must be selected from provided discrete values. All constraints must be strictly satisfied.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes: node_1 and node_2 (supports, at y=0), node_3 (also y=0, between nodes). Load applied at node_3 (magnitude=10, direction=-45°). Must close truss, so need at least one extra node for triangulation, as three on a line cannot form a closed structure.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Node_1: pinned (restrains both x and y), node_2: roller (restrains y only). node_3 receives a significant diagonal load. To form a closed truss, an upper node above the x-axis (between node_1 and node_2) will complete a minimum triangle, better distributing load and allowing effective triangulation. This also gives direct load paths between supports and loaded node. Member areas will be assigned to equalize/cap maximum member stress while keeping mass below 30. As members are relatively short, smaller areas can be leveraged if stresses allow. All nodes must be referenced and design must remain compact.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Addition of one node above (x=3.0, y>0) gives a symmetric configuration and enables two adjoining triangles: efficient for force distribution. Directly connecting all three base nodes and the new upper node ensures closure. Small area members can be chosen if force paths are favorable and force splitting is harnessed. Need to check mass and stress for the critical members (especially diagonals with highest loads).",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation above the x-axis enables efficient vertical and lateral load transfer. Using symmetry, placing the new node at (3.0, y) minimizes overall member length, mass, and keeps diagonals short. All members should be dimensioned to carry their share of load under max stress constraint. Since all external nodes are given, only new node can be positioned. Area IDs will be chosen based on required cross-section from force estimates, biasing towards lower mass if stresses remain below ±15.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All truss members are pin-ended; basic statics/truss analysis is valid. New node, node_4, at (3.0, y), with y determined for optimal force distribution and minimal member length (try y ≈ 2.4 for near-equilateral layout). Members: (node_1-node_2), (node_1-node_3), (node_2-node_3), diagonals to node_4. Calculate all member lengths, estimate forces using static equilibrium: balance vertical and horizontal components, assuming load at node_3 mostly carried by surrounding triangles. Stress = force/area; mass = area × length, summed for all members. Area_id selected to keep max |stress| ≤ 15. Initial area_id guess: \'2\' (0.782), increase for diagonals if calculations show overload.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node coords: node_1=(0.0,0.0), node_2=(6.0,0.0), node_3=(2.0,0.0), node_4=(3.0,2.40).

Layout ensures forces shared among diagonals; estimate: most diagonals will not exceed load/factor of safety; axial force in member connecting node_3 to node_4 will be largest. Assign \'3\' (1.759) for diagonals and critical lower members, \'1\' (0.195) for edges with minimal load. Calculate: total mass ≈ (6.0+2.0+4.0)*0.195 + (3.94+3.94+2.20)*1.759 ≈ 2.34+17.73=20.07 < 30.
