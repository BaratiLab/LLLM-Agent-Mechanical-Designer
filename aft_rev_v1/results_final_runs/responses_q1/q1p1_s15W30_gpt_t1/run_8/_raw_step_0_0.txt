The structure must be closed and leverage optimal triangulation to transfer oblique loads.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes in near-linear configuration: node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 (force -10@-45° at (2,0)). Triangulation needed for stability and stress minimization. Must use only given cross-sectional areas and maintain global connectivity.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-10 kN at -45°) induces both horizontal and vertical reactions at supports. Triangulation is needed to efficiently transfer this diagonal load to the two supports at the base (node_1, node_2). Current triangle (nodes 1-2-3) is minimal but sub-optimal in mass-vs-stress; a fourth node above the base improves force distribution, reducing member stress without excess mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a node above node_3 enables force splitting and reduces peak member stresses. Ensures triangulation and closed connectivity, improves redundancy, and allows thinner members in most paths. Member area selection can favor the lowest area where stress is projected below ±15. Upper node placement should align projection of force for minimal action.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Place a new node \'node_4\' vertically above node_3 at (2.0, y>0) to form two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4). Connecting node_4 to node_1, node_2, and node_3 closes the structure and allows efficient pathing of vertical and inclined load components. Member selection then balances minimal area with max stress constraint. Choose smallest possible area_ids per member.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume area = 1 for all members initially.

Check force in each under the -10kN@-45° load via static/truss solver (manually balance at node_3, resolve global vertical/horizontal equilibrium).
