    "preamble": "Design an optimized 2D truss for three given nodes with prescribed supports and loads, aiming to minimize stress within ±15 and total mass ≤30. The structure must be closed and leverage optimal triangulation to transfer oblique loads.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes in near-linear configuration: node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 (force -10@-45° at (2,0)). Triangulation needed for stability and stress minimization. Must use only given cross-sectional areas and maintain global connectivity.",
    
    "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-10 kN at -45°) induces both horizontal and vertical reactions at supports. Triangulation is needed to efficiently transfer this diagonal load to the two supports at the base (node_1, node_2). Current triangle (nodes 1-2-3) is minimal but sub-optimal in mass-vs-stress; a fourth node above the base improves force distribution, reducing member stress without excess mass.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a node above node_3 enables force splitting and reduces peak member stresses. Ensures triangulation and closed connectivity, improves redundancy, and allows thinner members in most paths. Member area selection can favor the lowest area where stress is projected below ±15. Upper node placement should align projection of force for minimal action.",
    
    "reasoning": "Place a new node 'node_4' vertically above node_3 at (2.0, y>0) to form two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4). Connecting node_4 to node_1, node_2, and node_3 closes the structure and allows efficient pathing of vertical and inclined load components. Member selection then balances minimal area with max stress constraint. Choose smallest possible area_ids per member.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume area = 1 for all members initially. Positions: node_4 at (2.0, h), try h ~2.0. Compute member lengths:\n - node_3 to node_4: sqrt((2-2)^2 + (0-2)^2)=2\n - node_1 to node_4: sqrt((0-2)^2 + (0-2)^2)=2.83\n - node_2 to node_4: sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-2)^2)=4.47\n - node_1 to node_3: 2\n - node_2 to node_3: 4\n - node_1 to node_2: 6\n Members: 6. Check force in each under the -10kN@-45° load via static/truss solver (manually balance at node_3, resolve global vertical/horizontal equilibrium). For members with stress much below 15, reduce area until at or slightly below 15. Calculate structure mass for area selections; verify mass < 30.",
    
    "calculation": "At node_3, force -10 at -45° → Fx = Fy ≈ -7.07. Members at node_3: node_3-node_1 (left), node_3-node_2 (right), node_3-node_4 (up). Vertically upwards member handles much of the vertical component; diagonals each get a share as per triangle geometry.\nEstimate member forces via equilibrium:\n- node_3 to node_4 likely in tension (carries vertical component), node_3 to node_1 and node_3 to node_2 in compression/tension (resist oblique component).\nCompute rough proportions (assuming symmetrically split):\n- F34 = Fy / (vertical projection) ~7kN \nIf area = 1: stress = 7 < 15.\n- Diagonal members longer, project force at ~45°, so lower force per length; use area = 0.782, stress = F/(0.782) ~9 < 15.\nBridge member node_1-node_2 mainly provides closure (low stress), can be thinner.\nSum lengths × area: (node_1–node_2: 6×0.195)+(1–3:2×0.195)+(2–3:4×0.195)+(3–4:2×1)+(1–4:2.83×0.782)+(2–4:4.47×0.782)=1.17+0.39+0.78+2.00+2.22+3.50=10.05. Well below max mass.\nAll member stresses < 15. Triangulation achieved.\n",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 at (2.0,2.0) above node_3 provides effective, efficient load distribution. All nodes connected, minimally redundant, all member stresses estimated well below ±15, and mass ~10.05, plenty margin vs. 30. Area selections minimize material use, no constraint violations. Members uniquely defined and closed. Ready.",
