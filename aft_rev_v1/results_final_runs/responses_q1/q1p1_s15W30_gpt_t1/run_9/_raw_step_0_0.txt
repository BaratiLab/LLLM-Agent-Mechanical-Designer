Optimization focuses on direct and triangulated load paths, appropriate area selection, and mass efficiency.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The 2D truss has nodes positioned linearly at the base, with node_3 offset between the two supports but also aligned at the base, making it challenging to triangulate. The load at node_3 is significant (-10 at -45°), demanding triangulation to efficiently transfer forces to supports while minimizing mass and stress. I can introduce a top node for triangulation.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Supports: pinned (node_1), roller (node_2). Node_3 takes an inclined downward force. Since all nodes are collinear along the base, a triangle is not inherently possible—they define a line. For a closed truss, at least one more node is needed (e.g., node_4) positioned above the base to allow triangulation (improving stability and force distribution). The optimal location for node_4 is estimated above node_3 for symmetric load transfer. All nodes and members must form a closed path (i.e., a triangle and a diagonal). Failure to triangulate would induce excessive force in the members parallel to the load, possibly breaching the stress limit. The mass must be minimized, so member areas need to be carefully chosen based on estimated forces.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "With a new node above, triangles can be formed: node_1 — node_3 — node_4, node_2 — node_3 — node_4, and node_1 — node_2 — node_4. The main load travels from node_3 up to node_4 and then splits between node_1 and node_2, minimizing direct tension/compression in the base members. I must select members so all parts are efficiently loaded, assigning higher area to those with higher force.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A new node_4 is proposed above node_3 for symmetry (since node_3 is between nodes 1 and 2). The load on node_3 at -45° suggests that the resultant load path is both vertical and toward the left. With node_4 slightly above node_3 (height determined for equal force distribution and compact mass), the truss can be triangulated: (1) base: node_1–node_2, (2) legs: node_1–node_4, node_2–node_4, (3) diagonals: node_1–node_3, node_2–node_3, (4) vertical: node_3–node_4, forming a closed loop. Force analysis will guide area selection, preferring lighter members where force is lower.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "- Key assumption: node_4 at (4.0, 2.5).
