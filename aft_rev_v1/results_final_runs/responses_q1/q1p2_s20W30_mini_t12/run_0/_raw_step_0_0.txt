Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller), load at node_3. Aim for a stable triangulated structure with one additional node for closure.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "3 original nodes: node_1 (0,0, pinned), node_2 (6,0, roller), node_3 (2,0, load -10N at -45°). Need a closed truss, so members must form at least one cycle. Current line won\'t provide stability and load distribution. Important to create a triangular topology. Adding a new node above nodes for triangulation will help distribute load and reduce stress.",\n\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 is downward-left diagonal (-10N at -45°). Supports fix horizontal movement at node_1 and vertical at node_2. The structure must resist this by members transferring force both axially and vertically. Without a vertical or diagonal support member above or near node_3, stress concentrations occur. Triangulation allows axial load transfer and minimizes bending/moment effects. Mass constraint requires careful cross-section choices, prioritizing smaller areas on short/non-critical members and stronger members on high-force paths.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key insights: Add a node (node_4) near x=3 direction and ~y=3 to form triangles: node_1-node_4-node_3 and node_3-node_4-node_2. Members: 1-3, 3-2 (base line), plus 1-4, 4-2, 4-3 forming triangles. This creates a closed structure with triangles for stability. Area choices of cross-section can optimize mass/stress tradeoff. Members near load transfer larger loading, choose bigger areas there, smaller for others. Avoid long slender members to reduce stress.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Introduce node_4 at (3.0, 2.6) approx for good load transfer height, ensuring good angles (~60°) from base nodes. Members: (1-3), (3-2), (1-4), (2-4), (3-4). This forms two adjacent triangular substructures. Use larger areas on members from node_3 to supports and node_4 to supports; smaller on diagonals away from load. Use discrete area selection from IDs for mass control. Assumption: uniform material and unit density for mass proportionality. Node coordinates kept concise to 1e-2 precision.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: line segments between nodes, then estimate member forces via static equilibrium equations of nodes, assuming axial forces only and using load decomposition (Horizontal & Vertical). Cross-sectional areas assigned to maintain stress ≤ 20 N/unit area. Estimate mass = sum(length * area). Select minimum area ids satisfying constraints. Member stress = load/area.
