Objective is to minimize stress within ±20 and mass ≤ 30 by optimizing topology, node placement, and member cross sections.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Initial structure with three collinear nodes is unstable under vertical load applied at node_3. No closed polygon with current nodes. Need at least one more node above the baseline to form a triangle and create a stable truss to resist vertical and horizontal reactions properly.",\n\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-10 at -45°) implies a downward and leftward force on the midpoint of the span between pinned (node_1) and roller (node_2) supports. The original nodes are collinear in x-axis, so under vertical-horizontal loads, the truss won’t resist bending or shear without instability. Adding node_4 above node_3 creates two stable triangles: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_3-node_4-node_2, forming a closed shape that carries load mainly in axial axial forces inside members. Triangulation ensures redundant paths and reduces stress. The load path transmits the force from node_3 up to node_4, then balanced into supports at node_1 and node_2. Area selections should balance between reducing stress (larger area) and restricting mass (sum area * length ≤ 30). Significant stress expected in shorter vertical/hypotenuse members while baseline members might carry compression/tension unevenly.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Clear need to create a triangular shape added node. Members triangulated to offer stiffer load path and reduce bending moments. Symmetry not perfect but acceptable with node_4 close to node_3 but elevated to reduce member lengths. Avoid large member cross sections on long baseline to keep mass in check. Smaller members near load path can have moderate areas to keep stress < 20.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Placing node_4 above node_3 by about 3 units (0.0, 3.0) creates an isosceles triangle that encloses the load point, effectively transforming a 1D unstable collinear line into a stable closed shape. Connect members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_1 for first triangle; and node_3-node_2, node_2-node_4 for second triangle. Using area_id \'5\'(4.887) and \'4\'(3.128) for longer members to reduce stress and smaller areas like \'2\'(0.782) or \'1\'(0.195) on the shorter diagonals help meet mass constraint. This formation improves force distribution and stability significantly.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume simple axial forces in members under static equilibrium. Use nodal equilibrium in x and y: ΣFx=0, ΣFy=0 at node_3 and node_4. Calculate member lengths for mass. Stress = Force / Area. Use trigonometry to derive member angles and resolve member force components. Balance load (-10 at -45° => Fx=-10cos45= -7.07, Fy=-10sin45= -7.07) at node_3 in resultant force calculation. Mass = sum of (length × area_id_value), area_id values from dict.
