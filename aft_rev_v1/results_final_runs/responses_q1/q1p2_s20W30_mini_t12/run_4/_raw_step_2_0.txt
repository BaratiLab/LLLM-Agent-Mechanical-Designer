Objective: reduce max stress from 17.08, keep mass <30, maintain stable closed geometry, and satisfy supports and load.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given a load on node_3 (-10N at -45°), pinned support node_1 and roller support node_2 fixed. Current max stress is ~17.08 and total mass is 16.7781 within 30. Structure is a quadrilateral with diagonal bracing.",\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 induces compression/tension in members directly connected thereto. Member_1 (node_1-node_3) shows highest compressive stress ~-17.08. Triangulation provided by node_5 keeps stability. Member areas vary from 1 to 3 in units, bigger members at node_1-node_5 and others. Current mass is fairly light at 16.78. Structure is connected and closed. Secondary solutions in history show more mass (32+) for reduced max stress but violate constraints.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing cross-sectional area on low-stress members and increasing area on high-stress members could reduce max stress better. Node positions except fixed nodes can be adjusted to improve member orientations. Potential to move node_5 slightly upward (y > 3.0) to optimize force flow. Avoid adding new nodes as no history shows advantage and adding nodes increase mass. Use areas thoughtfully - upgrade heavily stressed members area_id to higher, reduce area for low stress else increase mass unnecessarily.",\n    "proposal": "Optimize current node_5 location upwards from (4.00,3.00) to reduce stresses. Adjust member areas increasing member_1\'s area_id from \'2\' (0.782) to \'3\' (1.759) due to high stress; decrease low stressed member_3 to \'1\' (0.195). Possible re-evaluate member_2 increasing from \'1\' to \'2\'. Keep rest same or slight adjustments. This incremental improvement focuses on redistribution, lightening low stressed members while reinforcing high stress ones.",\n    "reasoning": "Symmetry unnecessary, but arrangement ensures stability and proper load path with diagonal triangulation. Load path: node_3 force carried primarily by members 1,5 then to supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Enlarging stressed members reduces stress magnitude. Moving node_5 vertically alters angle of force transfer in members 3,4,5 to reduce stressing these members. No nodes with loads or supports repositioned. Ensures closed stable truss with minimized stress and compliant mass.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Mass calculation = sum(length * area_density). Lengths from node coordinates. Areas defined by area_id. Calculate member lengths, stresses estimated proportional to member forces / area. Updated node_5 position as (4.00, 3.60) raises node_5 by 0.6m to improve member angles. Verify max member stress < 20, total mass < 30. Members 1 and 2 upgraded, member 3 reduced to lightest appropriate section.",\n    "calculation": "Node distances updated with node_5 at (4.00,3.60). Approximate length(node_5-node_2)=sqrt((6.0-4.0)^2+(0-3.6)^2)=4.17, slightly longer. Member areas: member_1=1.759, member_2=0.782, member_3=0.195, member_4=2 (original), member_5=2 (original). Total mass recalculated around 18.5 geringer to original 16.7 plus area increases on some members less offset by reducing member_3. Max stress estimated lowered to ~14.0 safe margin due to increased area at critical tension member_1. Design passes max stress & mass <=30.
