    "preamble": "Optimize a minimal-stress, closed 2D truss connecting given nodes under a downward-left diagonal load at node_3, fixed at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Objective: meet stress and mass constraints with efficient triangulation and load transfer.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes: node_1(0,0, pinned), node_2(6,0, roller), node_3(2,0, loaded: 10N at -45°). Only three colinear nodes, requires closed structure with at least one new node to form triangle for stability and stress distribution. Constraints: max stress±20, total mass≤30, areas selected from given discrete sets. Initial action: add a new node above the line between node_1 and node_2 to form triangle.",
    
    "analysis": "Current nodes are co-linear, no closed polygon, no triangulation → no stable truss. Load at node_3 (-10N diagonally left-down) induces significant bending moment needing a triangular frame. Supports fixed at nodes 1 & 2 prevent horizontal movement. A single triangle with fourth node ensures closed truss and load path. Member axial forces needed to carry load within stress constraint are calculated by static equilibrium approximations. Chosen cross-sections tailored to minimize mass and keep stresses ≤20.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "The load at node_3 generates tension/compression in members surrounding it. Introducing node_4 at (3.0,2.5) (mid-span above chord) will allow formation of two triangles: 1-3-4 and 2-3-4, fully triangulated and closed. It directs load paths effectively. Area sizes must vary per member length and expected axial force to keep stress under 20 and mass under 30. Members connecting supports to node_4 take largest forces, assigning bigger areas there.",
    
    "reasoning": "Add node_4 (3.0, 2.5) - top node above base chord (0,0)-(6,0). Edge members: (1-3), (3-2), (1-4), (4-2), (3-4). This creates two triangles: (1-3-4) and (4-3-2), fulfilling closed truss requirement with load transfer paths. Cross-sectional area allocation respects force levels, longer members with bigger forces get bigger area, shorter/tension members smaller area for mass savings. Leveraging axial force formulas and geometry to assign areas from provided discrete set.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic, members carry axial force only; loads resolve into components; stress = force / area; mass = Σ(length_i × area_i). Calculate member lengths by distance formula; forces found by method of joints assuming static equilibrium: sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0 at each joint; cross-sectional areas chosen to keep stress|σ| ≤20. Calculate length and chosen areas, check total mass ≤30. Approximate forces by balancing applied loads with reactions at supports and internal members. Allocate areas accordingly.",
