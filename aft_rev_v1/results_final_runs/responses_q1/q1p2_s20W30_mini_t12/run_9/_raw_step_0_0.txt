A line of 3 nodes alone is insufficiently stable and not closed. Need at least one new node to create a closed truss (triangular or more complex). Triangulating to distribute load efficiently is prime strategy.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 applies downward-left pull, inducing tension/compression in members around node_3. With supports at ends along x-axis, vertical components must transfer through members into supports. Current nodes colinear (along x) means no vertical member to resist load directly; adding a new node above node_3 to create a triangle can balance vertical reactions. Member lengths, cross-section sizes affect stresses and mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Minimal closed truss requires adding at least one node above x-axis to form triangle. Symmetry and short effective member lengths reduce mass & stress. Load transferred via two triangular members joining node_3 to supports through apex node. Small cross-sections suited for compression; tension members need slightly higher area. Ensure everyone connected to maintain closure.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Create new node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) above node_3: height 3. Compact triangle (node_1)-(node_4)-(node_3), (node_4)-(node_2), and base (node_1)-(node_2). This triangular shape provides vertical stiffness. Members: (1-3) base along x; (1-4) diagonal; (4-3) diagonal; (4-2) link to roller. Cross-sectional area set according to member forces to keep stress ≤±20 and mass ≤30.

Member length calculated via Euclidean distance. Stress = Force / Area; constrain ±20 units. Mass as sum of length×area. Solve system statics at nodes (sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0).
