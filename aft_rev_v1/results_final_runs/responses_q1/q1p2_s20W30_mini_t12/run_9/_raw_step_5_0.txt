The objective is to generate a closed 2D truss that reduces max stresses within ±20 and total mass under 30, satisfying the pinned and roller supports and a single external load (-10 N at -45° at node_3).",\n\n  "scratch_pad_1": "The external load induces tension/compression primarily on members connected to loaded node 3. Supports are fixed at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) along x-axis. Failure likely occurs due to over-stressed members along horizontal line node_1 - node_3 - node_2 and vertical members node_4 and node_5. Mass is large due to heavy cross sections or member lengths. The key is to increase triangulation and redistribute loads to avoid overload.",\n\n  "analysis": "The existing layout uses a five-node setup including two upper nodes (node_4, node_5) with widths around 3 to 4 m and 3 m height creating non-symmetric and elongated members. Members connected directly to node_3 have high negative stress (-52) mostly compressive which indicates insufficient bracing or stiff intersections. Structure generation history shows attempts with smaller upper width and moves to increase triangulation, but max stress didn\'t fall under 20. Larger areas add mass above 30. No structure fully satisfies constraints yet. Critical load path runs from load at node_3 along node_1 to node_2 via top diagonal members. Current member sizing (area_id) is mostly large (2 to 4) due to stress, increasing mass.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress reduction requires better load path redundancy, using multiple triangles to spread load and limit force on direct members from loaded node_3. Symmetry could reduce eccentricities. Node positions of loaded and supported nodes remain fixed, requiring adjusting upper nodes and member cross sections carefully. Slightly reducing upper nodes width and raising height improves triangulation but risks long slender members with bending. Optimal member cross section assignment must balance length × area mass and stress requirements.",\n\n  "proposal": "Adopt a symmetric four-node top chord with uniform height 3.00 m positioned to form two adjacent triangles on each side centered around node_3 to redistribute the forces. Use seven members: two verticals, four diagonals, and one bottom chord spanning node_1 to node_2. Fix nodes 1, 2, and 3 as given. Set node_4 at (2.3, 3.0) and node_5 at (3.7, 3.0) for symmetry and to form two adjacent triangles: node_1-4-3, 3-4-5, and 5-3-2. Assign cross sections from area_id to control stress and minimize mass using smaller area_id where stress is low.",\n\n  "reasoning": "A closed symmetrical truss with improved triangulation will cut max stress. The two triangles adjacent to node_3 offer redundant load paths from load node_3 to support nodes without overstressing any single member. The bottom chord from node_1 to node_2 transfers horizontal reactions. Vertical members node_1-4 and node_2-5 stabilize the structure, while diagonals split tension and compression demands. Assumptions: members carry axial loads only, pin-jointed, negligible bending. Cross diagrams and linear static analysis with trigonometry ensure member force reductions and stability. Choosing appropriate areas (smaller area_id for shorter members) keeps mass within 30 constraint. Load magnitude is 10 N downward at 45°.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Compute horizontal and vertical reaction forces at supports using equilibrium:\\n\\nSigma Fx=0 and Sigma Fy=0, moments about supports.\\n\\nBreak load force -10 N at 45° into components (-7.07, -7.07) at node_3.\\n\\nUse method of joints for forces in members using equilibrium in x,y at each node.\\n\\nCalculate member lengths using distance formula.\\n\\nCalculate stress as member force / (area * member length fraction).
