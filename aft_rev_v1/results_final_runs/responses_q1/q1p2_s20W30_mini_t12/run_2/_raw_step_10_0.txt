Current iterative structures consistently exceed the max stress constraint ±20 units and the total mass limit of 30. The optimization objective is to produce a fully triangulated and stable closed truss that strictly respects both maximum stress and total mass constraints while maintaining nodes with loads and supports fixed, minimizing overall mass and stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "We analyze the current truss which has nodes positioned along x=0,2,4,6 and y=0 or y~3.2. Loads are applied downward-left at node_3 on bottom chord. Supports at nodes 1 (pinned, bottom-left) and 2 (roller, bottom-right). Current structure\'s max stress ~7.1 max mass ~30.27 above acceptable mass for improved designs. Members are clustered mostly around 2 or 3 area IDs. Structure is closed and includes triangulation but moderate stress concentration elevated by partial load transfer to vertical members at edges.",\n  "analysis": "Current structure uses top and bottom chords with multiple diagonal members. Stress peaks near node_4 due to orthogonal load transfer and edge effect near pinned support. Mass is borderline ok but can be reduced. Designs attempting height adjustments in node_4 and node_6 gave reduced max stress but added too much mass. Load at node_3 transfers via diagonals and verticals; critical members are \'member_4\' node_1-node_4 and some diagonals. Previous better stress/mass tradeoffs had better symmetric triangulation and reduced long unsupported members. Openings or missing triangulations reduce load paths efficiency, causing over-stress. Historic structures failing constraints confirm load path inefficiencies from these arrangements.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Insight: Keeping nodes_1 and _2 fixed is essential due to supports given. Node_3 load position is fixed. Key to improved design is optimal member area choices and subtle node height tuning of intermediate nodes to improve load paths & reduce hard bending of load. Using classic Warren or Pratt truss style closed triangulated design permits load paths well distributed with lesser peak stress. Moderate areas on chord members with slightly increased cross sections on critical diagonals provide manageable mass. Avoid over-large areas on non-critical members to keep mass within limit.",\n  "proposal": "Redesign to maintain the six given nodes with fixed supports/load. Adjust heights of nodes_4 and _6 to balance load transfer (~2.9m approx). Establish closed truss formed by bottom chord nodes (node_1, node_3, node_5, node_2), top chord nodes (node_4, node_6), triangulated with diagonals: connecting bottom to top nodes and cross diagonals across shorter spans. Member area selections from id \'2\' (0.782), \'3\' (1.759), and minimal \'1\' (0.195) for light members help satisfy mass and stress constraints. This essentially is a classical double triangular truss with optimized member sizes.",\n  "reasoning": "Symmetry across midpoint (between node_3 and node_5) splits loads evenly. Triangles ensure static determinacy and prevent mechanisms. Load at node_3 transfers through vertical and diagonal members to supports node_1 and node_2 equally. Using top chord height ~2.9 reduces bending stress concentration. Moderate cross-sectional members provide enough resistance without excess mass. Diagonals absorb shear efficiently. The area_id choice strategy assigns larger around the most stressed members (verticals, main diagonals), lighter sections to chords to save mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions:\\n- Material stress proportional to force/cross sectional area\\n- Linear elastic behavior, max stress calculated from max force/area\\n- Member mass approximated by member length × area id factor\\n\\nEquations:\\nLength(m) via Pythagoras\\nMass = sum(length_i × area_i × unit_density) ignoring unit_density for relative comparison\\nMax stress ≤ 20\\n\\nMember force distribution from equilibrium - vertical and horizontal force balances at loaded and support nodes.\\n\\nMember selection prioritized by force magnitude relative to area to minimize stress.\\n\\nTrial node heights ~2.9 to reduce eccentricity of loads\\n\\nEnsure fully connected and no isolated nodes.",\n  "calculation": "Node coordinates:\\nnode_1 = (0.00, 0.00)\\nnode_2 = (6.00, 0.00)\\nnode_3 = (2.00, 0.00)\\nnode_5 = (4.00, 0.00)\\nnode_4 = (2.00, 2.90)\\nnode_6 = (4.00, 2.90)\\n\\nMember lengths approximate:\\nm1: node_1-node_3 = sqrt(2^2 + 0^2) = 2m\\nm2: node_3-node_5 = 2m\\nm3: node_5-node_2 = 2m\\nm4: node_1-node_4 = sqrt(0^2 + 2.9^2) = 2.9m\\nm5: node_4-node_6 = 2m\\nm6: node_6-node_2 = 2.9m\\nm7: node_3-node_4 = sqrt(0^2 + 2.9^2) = 2.9m\\nm8: node_5-node_6 = 2.9m\\nm9: node_4-node_5 = 2m\\n\\nProposed area assignment (area IDs in strings):\\nm1, m3: 2 (\'0.782\')\\n  - Length 2m × 0.782 → 1.564 combined each\\nm2: 1 (\'0.195\')\\n  - Length 2m × 0.195 = 0.39 (center chord lighter since less load)\\nm4, m6: 4 (\'3.128\') \\n  - Length 2.9m × 3.128 = 9.071 each\\nm5, m9: 2 (\'0.782\')\\n  - Length 2m × 0.782 = 1.564 each\\nm7, m8: 3 (\'1.759\')\\n  - Length 2.9m × 1.759 = 5.10 each\\n\\nTotal mass approx:\\nBottom chord: m1+m2+m3 = 1.564 + 0.39 + 1.564 = 3.52\\nVerticals and main diagonals (heavier): m4+m6+m7+m8 = 9.071 + 9.071 + 5.10 + 5.10 = 28.34\\nCross member m5+m9 = 1.564 + 1.564 = 3.128\\nWhole approx mass = 3.52 + 28.34 + 3.128 = ~35 kg\\n\\nTo meet mass <=30, reduce some heavy verticals from area \'4\' to \'3\'(1.759).
