Objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss with lower member areas leading to total mass <=30 and max stress within ±20 under given load and supports.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Loads at node_3 (-10 N at -45 deg), supports pinned node_1, roller node_2. Original structure height ~3.12m, base 6m with intermediate nodes. Previous successful constraints require reducing mass from ~59 to <=30. Mass reduced by reducing cross-sectional areas and selecting member layout with stable triangulation and symmetry.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The structure is a rectangular frame with upper chord and vertical/horizontal/interior diagonals. Load at node_3 induces bending and axial stresses mainly in members connected to node_3. Largest stresses occur in members directly linked to node_3 and vertical bracing members linked to supports. High total mass stems from relatively large chosen areas to limit stresses. Smaller areas cause excessive stresses in diagonals and chord members. Efficient load transfer needs stable triangulation, so closed rectangular frame with two verticals and two diagonals per side is ideal. Low areas on chords cause high stress peak under loading. History shows lower mass and better stress balance in designs with one rectangular bay (nodes at base 0,2,4 and height 3) having well triangulated diagonals and moderate cross-sectional areas around 2 or 3.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: unilateral diagonals are bad, symmetrical diagonals better. Higher node height improves stress distribution but may increase member length hence mass. Smaller area IDs close to 2–4 range balance stress and mass. Multiplier areas of \'1\' or \'0.195\' lead to too light members with very high stress. Also note including horizontal members increases mass but helps stability.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Propose a simplified 6-node rectangular frame with base at 6 m, nodes at base 0.00m, 2.00m, 4.00m, and height 3.00m. Use diagonal and vertical members for triangulation. Assign cross sectional areas between 2 and 4 (0.782 to 3.128) for balancing stress and weight. Keep edges connected to supports pinned and roller, loaded node fixed at current position. Weight target <= 30 with peak stress well under 20 achieved by reducing chosen member areas rationally. Remove or change diagonals that contributed to high local stresses previously. Maintain symmetry. Members forming triangles over two bays.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Following structural principles: Closed series of triangles prevent instability under substantial loads. Supports limit displacements at nodes 1 and 2. Loading point at node 3 induces shear and bending. Use two bay bridge-like stable geometry ensures load path from loaded node to supports through balanced membranes which evenly consider compression and tension members. By reducing cross-sectional areas on vertical and diagonal members close to 0.782–3.128 and chord members slightly larger, stress remains bounded and mass decreases substantially. Avoid very small areas leading to excessive stress. Node positions aligned with original as much as supports/loads demand. Height fixed at 3m aids stable load transfer. Final design closes loop fully and maintains symmetry radiating from loaded node for longitudinally distributed load paths.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Structural behavior approximated by simple 2D truss statics.
