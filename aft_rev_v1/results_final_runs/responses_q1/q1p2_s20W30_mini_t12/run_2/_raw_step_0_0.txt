Objective: Closed, fully connected structure minimizing stress under load with mass and stress constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes are provided on the x-axis: node_1 at (0,0), node_3 at (2,0), and node_2 at (6,0). Load: -10 @ -45° at node_3; supports: pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Only 3 nodes placed linearly → no closed structure yet. Need at least one additional node off-axis to triangulate and form a closed frame.",\n\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 acts diagonally downward-left causing bending and axial forces. Given only three colinear nodes, structure is unstable and cannot form a closed truss. Introduce a new apex node above the nodes to form a triangle which forms a stable closed truss. Members will be the base (node_1 to node_2), both sides to apex node, plus diagonal and supporting members as required, ensuring triangulation. Expect compressive force in vertical member, tension in bottom chords. Check stress against max ±20. Use area from given area_id list for mass and stiff members.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Base length 6 units. To get good force distribution, choose apex node approx above loaded node_3 near x=2.0 and some positive y. Choosing y=3.0 creates two triangles: left (node_1, node_3, apex), right (node_2, node_3, apex). This ensures stability and stiffness. Triangulated closed frame with 4 nodes and 5 members. Load path guides areas: largest cross-sections near node_3 to transfer load effectively, thinner members farther away for mass efficiency.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) above node_3 to form triangles node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_2-node_3-node_4, creating a gateway for load transfer upwards. Use direct diagonal members for triangulation: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2. Choose area_id values to minimize stress under load: thicker members in load path (node_3 to node_4), medium for node_1-node_4 and node_4-node_2, thinner for others while keeping total mass ≤30.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic members, load transfer via axial forces only. Equilibrium: sum forces in x and y = 0, moment sum=0. Member length calculated by Euclidean distance, mass = length × area. Cross-section areas from area_ids recalibrated to stress demands. Calculate member forces from equilibrium equations. Calculate max stress = force/area ≤ 20. Adjust area_id accordingly.
