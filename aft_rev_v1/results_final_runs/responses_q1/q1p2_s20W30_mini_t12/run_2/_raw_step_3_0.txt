Objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss that satisfies max stress ±20 and total mass ≤30 under given load and supports.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Load: -10 at node_3 at 45° down-left (compressive effect). Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Current design is minimal (4 nodes, 5 members) and simplified. Problematic member is highly stressed near node_1 to node_4, causing violation. Historic design with added intermediate node_5 improved stress but mass >30.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 causes bending forces, current members can\'t distribute stress effectively. Node_4 positioned at (3,3) pulls large tension in member_3 (node_1 to node_4). Simple structure limits load paths. The only historic feasible truss includes extra node_5 at x=4.0 on bottom chord, adding middle bottom node for better force distribution. However, historic gamma designs too heavy (>30 mass). Current failed design lacks enough triangulation and member redundancy.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_5 between node_3 and node_2 to introduce more triangles (closed kites/hats structure) for better load path distribution. Adjust node_4 vertical position to reduce member stresses, move it closer to line of force. Reduce member cross-sectional area where possible, increase only critical ones. Focus on energy and force balance via triangulation and shorter high-force member lengths to keep mass low.",\n   \n    "proposal": "Redesign structure with nodes: node_1(0,0 pinned), node_2(6,0 roller), add node_3(2,0) load, node_5(4,0) midsupport bottom chord, node_4 centralized between top over nodes 3 and 5. Connect members forming two adjacent triangles between bottom and top chords: (1-3), (3-5), (5-2), (1-4), (4-5), (4-3). Triangulation provides stable load paths with closed truss. Adjust node_4 height around 2.8 for balance. Assign cross-section area from area_id prioritizing 0.782 and 1.759 for members under less stress and 3.128 or 4.887 for critical compressive/tensile members between support and mid nodes.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Triangular top chord connects node_4 to nodes 3 and 5, sharing tension/compression from load at node_3. Bottom chord ties supports and nodes 3 and 5 resist shear. The pinned and roller boundary conditions prevent rigid body motion without overconstraint. Middle bottom node splits shear load. With nodal load orientation, minimal high cross-section members required, optimizing mass. Careful position of node_4 vertically mitigates over-tensile stresses previously observed and optimizes moment distribution.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Mass ∝ member length × area; length calc via Euclidean distance; stress ∝ normal force/area (estimate force by equilibrium). Force balance fx=0, fy=0 and moment=0 at a joint, here focus mostly on top node where load is applied. Calculate member lengths precisely, select cross-section areas to maintain max stress <20. Check total mass sum of member lengths × chosen area ≤30. Node_3 at (2,0) load -10 acting at 45° left-down decomposes force vectors Fx ~ -7.07, Fy ~ -7.07. Use symmetry between nodes 3 and 5 and connected members to split forces.",\n  \n    "calculation": "Node coords: node_1 (0.0, 0.0), node_2 (6.0, 0.0), node_3 (2.0, 0.0), node_5 (4.0, 0.0), node_4 (3.1, 2.8). Member lengths approx: m1(1-3)=2.0, m2(3-5)=2.0, m3(5-2)=2.0, m4(1-4)=3.49, m5(4-3)=2.96, m6(4-5)=1.23.
