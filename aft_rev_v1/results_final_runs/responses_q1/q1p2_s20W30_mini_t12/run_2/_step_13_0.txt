  "preamble": "Current truss with nodes at y=3.1 under vertical + oblique load at node_3 shows overstress (max stress 5.75) but exceeds mass constraint (mass 78.75 >30). Optimization target is to design a closed truss with triangulation to meet load safely under max stress ±20 and total mass ≤30, retaining supports and load positions unchanged.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Loads: -10.0 at node_3 at -45 degrees (compressive/tensile components). Supports: pinned at node_1, roller at node_2 fixed. Existing structure with two upper nodes at ≈3.1m height carry triangular geometry but mass too high indicating oversizing or inefficient force paths. Attempts with raised deck nodes and varying member areas show tradeoff between stress and mass constraint.",
  "analysis": "Current structure is double symmetric spanning 6m base with nodes at x=2 and 4 and top y around 3.1 representing two bays. Members connected form quad with internal diagonals for triangulation, but stresses indicate that member_1 near load is possibly overloaded. Structure mass high due to large cross-sections needed for stress control. Increasing node heights alleviated max stress but increased length and mass. Lowering node height reduces mass but increases stress, violating limits. Historically, single bay/truss or missing triangulation led to concentration and high stress, especially on members connecting loaded and support nodes. The load pulls down at -45°, creating tension on near diagonal and compression on others. Proper continuous triangulation with balanced load paths will strongly distribute stress. Member areas should be chosen conservatively but not over-sized to respect mass constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Pattern: Structures with node y near 3 introducing longer members increase mass beyond constraints; shorter members on lower y side reduce mass but cause overload. Diagonal members near loading nodes and clearest load-transfer path improve stress but increase total mass. Key area: selective high-area members near loads and supports to handle tension/compression, but optimize others small to save mass. Double triangulated central span recommended. Proposals with three-dimensional nodes could help but 2D truss must be closed. Historical data shows structures with balanced triangulation and staggered heights approach <30 total mass with max stress <7, we can further optimize by shortening verticals or lowering height slightly to reduce mass but maintaining triangulation for safety.",
  "proposal": "Retain all 6 nodes with small vertical node increase from previous 3.1 to 3.3 (optimal spacing), keep base at x=0, 2, 4, 6 and y=0 for supports; tighten diagonal triangulation with cross connections and specify members with area_ids 2 or 3 minimum for load carrying members and smaller area_id 1 for less stressed members. This closed truss with triangulated bays forms two triangles per bay and cross braces per stability. Avoid reducing area near load/support nodes to prevent stress spikes but optimize mid members with lighter sections to meet mass. No node positions for load or supports change.",
  "reasoning": "Symmetry acceptable for load balance. Triangular topology with two bays distributes forces efficiently. Nodes at y=3.3m balances member length and minimizes vertical forces on diagonals versus mass penalty for longer members. Diagonal members resist bending moments, while horizontal members reduce overall displacement. Use trigonometry to calculate member lengths and forces. Selected cross-section area based on expected force from equilibrium conditions and force components for a -10 N load at node_3 acting at -45° (i.e. approx 7.07N x and y). Members closest to loading nodes use larger areas to keep stress within limits. Member mass estimated as length × area_id with density factor assumed uniform. Ensuring closed stable truss with no isolated nodes or redundant members prevents instability or zero-force members wasting mass.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: uniform density for mass, linear elastic stress; members equally respond to axial load only. Calculate member lengths via distance formula: length = sqrt((x2 -x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2). Force equilibrium at nodes set up for vertical and horizontal balance, considering member stiffness proportional to area_id and length constant. Mass = ∑ length × area_id using given table lookup from area_id str. Member area types selected for stress limits ±20 with margin. Load vector components Fx = -10*cos(45°) = approx -7.071 N, Fy = -10*sin(45°) = approx -7.071 N. Design key members (near loaded node-3) to area_id='3' or '4' for safety. Remaining members lighter area_id='1' to keep mass sum <30 while triangulated members closer to load get bigger areas to distribute forces. Vertical nodes fixed for load or support do not move: node_1 and node_2 at y=0, node_3 at y=0 fixed. Node_4 and _6 at y=3.3 new height. Node_5 stays at x=4, y=0 fixed to avoid changing nodes with loads/support resulting in simpler solution.",
