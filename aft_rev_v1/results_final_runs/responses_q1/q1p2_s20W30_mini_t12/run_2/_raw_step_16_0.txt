Objective is to redesign a stable, closed 2D truss under given loads and supports that meets max stress ±20 and total mass ≤ 30, maintaining node supports and load positions fixed.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Load is a force of 10 units at node_3 at -45°, nodes 1 and 2 at 0,0 and 6,0 are pinned and roller supports. The existing nodes (six) are arranged along bottom and at about 3.1 in height. History shows lower stress and criterion compliance with more symmetrical, evenly triangulated shapes. Current design’s light middle diagonal (\'member_5\' area 1) causes local high stress (~12).",\n  "analysis": "The load path moves from node_3 downward to supports at node_1 and node_2. The current design has sharp change in cross section near member_5 with smallest area_id = \'1\' causing highest stress concentration. The truss is closed with multiple triangles but member sizing is uneven. History indicates that symmetrical, balanced area sections with triangle configurations around middle height reduce max stress. Some structures with node_4 and node_6 vertically aligned at same height as 3.4 or 3.5 yielded lower maximum stresses (<8) but mass was above 30. Thus, effective height ~3 to 3.4, with uniformly distributed cross sections, can optimize load path and maintain balance between mass and stress. The current asymmetry between nodes 4 and 6 (2.2 vs 3.8 in x) and low areas causes stress peaks and inefficient load transfer. Fully connected triangulated frameworks mitigate bending and shear forces effectively.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Symmetry in node layout distributes the load evenly. Members connecting bottom chord and heights form efficient tension/compression triangles. Middle vertical members with proper stiffness reduce elongation and stresses. Using middle areas in range 3 to 5 balancing between area and length is key. Avoid too small areas for high load members like the diagonal loaded member_5 in current design. Lines connecting (node_4, node_5) and (node_3, node_6) add triangulation, must be sized consistently to avoid stress spikes.",\n  "proposal": "Redesign the structure using six nodes symmetrically spaced and two supports pinned and roller fixed. Nodes remain bottom fixed (0,0) and (6,0) with load at (2.00, 0.00). Optimize positions of upper nodes at about y=3.3 with x=2 and 4 (symmetrical about midpoint 3) for balance. Member cross section areas will be increased uniformly where stress is higher to reduce stress under load while keeping mass under limit. Area assignment mostly 3 and 4 scales, with highest on members transmitting load directly to supports and diagonal tension/compression members to share forces. Triangulate upper part with diagonal members for closure and stability. This ensures closed truss, constrained mass and stress below limits.",\n  "reasoning": "Triangular elements with base from 0 to 6 at y=0 provide axial load paths. Upper nodes around y=3.3 balance height for efficient vertical force dissipation. Maintaining symmetry around midpoint improves bending behavior, minimizing stress concentrations. Selecting area \'4\' or \'3\' for bottom chord ensures low mass but adequate force support; diagonals with \'5\' or \'4\' area dissipate higher axial stresses from load at node_3. Vertical and inclined members sized sufficiently avoid tensile/compressive stresses over ±20. Max stress expected below stress limits, total mass kept ≤ 30 by limiting large-section usage to most critical members only and keeping others small.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Nodes: Fix 1:(0, 0), 2:(6, 0), and 3:(2, 0) load node.
