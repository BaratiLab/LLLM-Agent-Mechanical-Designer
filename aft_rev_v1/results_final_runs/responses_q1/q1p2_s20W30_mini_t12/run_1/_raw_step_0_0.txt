Objective: minimize truss stress (≤ ±20) and total mass (≤ 30) by selecting optimal connections, adding nodes if required, and choosing suitable cross-sectional areas.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes form a line at ground level with load at node_3 downward-left 45°. Supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller) allow horizontal reactions at node_1 and vertical at node_2. Original three nodes collinear fail to form a closed triangle; must introduce an elevated node to triangulate and stabilize.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 creates bending if just connected linearly; no triangulation exists. Introducing a new node above node_3 increases rigidity and helps form triangular closed loop. Members need to distribute forces to supports effectively. Stresses depend on load path through members; members under tension or compression must not exceed ±20 stress limit. Cross-sectional areas chosen to balance stress and mass with given discrete area options. Truss should be light, so minimal yet efficient member count and moderate areas preferred.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Collinear nodes alone lead to large bending and exceed stress limits or lack stability. Adding new top node above node_3 between node_1 and node_2 enables forming two triangles: node_1–node_4–node_3 and node_3–node_4–node_2, achieving the closed structure needed while spreading loads. Symmetry not perfect but node_4 near midpoint above node_3 to assist in force distribution. Use middle range areas for members avoiding largest mass values but ensuring stresses under limit.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding new node_4 at approximately (3.0,2.5) forms two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_4, node_3, node_2). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4. This triangulation stabilizes loads. Assign areas based on estimated force (longer members with higher loads get bigger sections). Assumed axial force distribution is dominant; bending ignored for simplicity. Cross-section area chosen from given set to ensure stress ≤ 20 and total mass < 30. This approach provides closed path and optimizes internal force paths.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Load magnitude = 10 at node_3 at -45º implies force components F_x = -7.07, F_y = -7.07.

Mass = Σ(length × area). Cross sections discrete choices require trial matching. Calculate each member length: \\nnode_1-node_3: 2m; node_3-node_2: 4m; node_1-node_4: approx sqrt((3-0)^2+(2.5-0)^2)=3.91m; node_3-node_4: approx sqrt((3-2)^2+(2.5-0)^2)=2.69m; node_2-node_4: sqrt((6-3)^2+(0-2.5)^2)=3.91m.
