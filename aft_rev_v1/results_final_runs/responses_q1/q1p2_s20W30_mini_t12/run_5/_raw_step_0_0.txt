Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Single internal node needed for closure and triangulation. Area must be chosen from discrete area_id sets balancing stress and mass.",\n\n    "analysis": "The load acts diagonally at node_3 pushing left and down, the supports are at the ends (node_1 pinned, node_2 roller), preventing horizontal displacement at node_1 and vertical at node_2. Member layout should triangulate suspension between them to transfer load efficiently. With initial 3 nodes colinear, the truss is not closed or stable alone. Adding an internal node above the x-axis to form two triangles (node_1-node_4-node_3 and node_4-node_3-node_2) will provide load paths for both compression and tension distribution. We can choose moderate area values to keep stress within limits and total mass under 30. The stress limit ±20 implies balancing forces across members sized accordingly.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "The load causes tension and compression in diagonal members between node_3 and new node above baseline, while baseline chords handle axial compressive forces reactive to vertical load component. Extended triangle increases stability. Key is sizing cross sections to manage max stress without oversizing mass.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Introduce one new node above baseline: node_4 positioned at midpoint x=4.00, y=3.00 as a geometric compromise padding upward for creating two triangles: node_1-node_4-node_3 and node_4-node_3-node_2. Members chosen: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_3, and node_4-node_2 to close the loop. Chosen areas use higher area in diagonals carrying the main tensile/compressive loads, smaller area for others to save mass. This keeps structure statically determinate, stable, closed, and distributed so stress stays below ±20 and mass ≤ 30.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Material linear elasticity, stresses proportional to axial force/area. Member lengths from Euclidean distance. Calculate forces via method of joints starting with nodes with pinned/roller supports, check equilibrium Fx, Fy=0 per joint. Use projections of 10N at -45° (Fx= -7.07N, Fy= -7.07N). Calculate member axial forces, divide by area to get stress. Member mass = length × area. Sum masses must be ≤ 30.
