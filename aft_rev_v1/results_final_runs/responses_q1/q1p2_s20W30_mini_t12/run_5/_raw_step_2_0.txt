Objective is to generate a closed, statically stable 2D truss that meets stress and mass constraints with minimal stress and proper load transfer.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Input nodes include supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Load is applied at node_3 with magnitude 10 directed downward-left (-45°). Existing members have high stress in member_1 (-60.44). The max allowed stress is ±20, so the current design is overstressed primarily in members near the load node. Mass is below 30, so mass constraint satisfied. Need to enhance member distribution, add triangulation, and adjust member areas.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The load pushing diagonally down-left on node_3 induces high compressive force on member_1 (node_1-node_3). Support conditions are adequate for simple vertical + horizontal reactions, but member layout offers insufficient triangulation around the load point node_3 and node_5 resulting in high stress concentration. History structures with fewer nodes cause increased max stresses. Current design geometry places node_3 too close to node_1 and node_2 preventing efficient stress distribution. The irregular pentagonal topology may be causing inefficient force paths. Triangulated closed geometries distribute load better. Member areas show large variation suggesting stressed members driven by insufficient cross sections. Member_3 and member_4 large mass indicates larger sections on diagonal members are needed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Insights: Need strong diagonal members to resist direct load path. Close node positions near loaded node limits leveraging longer diagonal tension members. A symmetrical triangular and rectangular layout between supports and load reduces bending and high axial forces. Support nodes must stay fixed; load node position fixed; other nodes freely adjusted to improve triangulation. Member selection should prioritize moderate area sizes for stress distribution, avoiding oversized areas that add mass unnecessarily.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign truss as a symmetric, closed truss with nodes at supports (node_1 at (0,0), node_2 at (6,0)), load node_3 at (2.00, 0.00), plus introduce two new nodes elevated above the base at positions that enable distinct triangular elements distributing stresses effectively. Add diagonal members creating multiple clear load paths from node_3 to supports. Use moderate sectional areas to control stress and mass. Remove node_5; instead create nodes higher up for full triangulation and closed loop segments.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Placing two nodes above the base line at (2.5,2.75) and (4.0,2.55) creates a portal frame configuration enabling distributed diagonals from load node to the supports via these nodes. This layout provides multiple triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_6), (node_3, node_7, node_2), (node_6, node_7, node_3). Using wider base length between supports (0 to 6) with intermediate load and elevated nodes reduces axial load peaks. This distributes forces over multiple members avoiding high stresses. Select cross sections in range 0.782 (id \'2\') to 1.759 (id \'3\') to ensure balance between load capacity and mass minimization.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: cross sectional area selection limits max member axial force F_max = stress_max × A_min, and mass = sum(length × area_density). Calculate geometry lengths using distance formula. Estimate member forces by simple joint equilibrium considering load direction. Stresses computed as force/cross section area sized accordingly. Design incorporates loaded node fixity and support conditions. Diagonal members experience tension/compression. Members connected to load node have moderate area 0.782 to distribute load.
