The goal is to redesign a fully connected closed 2D truss that respects max stress and mass limits, minimizes stress concentrations, and keeps load and support nodes fixed in position.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The load is a -10N force at node_3 at 45° down-left. Supports are pinned at node_1 (0,0) and roller at node_2 (6,0). Existing design places nodes roughly in a trapezoidal shape with some internal diagonals but results in high stress on member_7 (node_3-node_5). Constraints max stress ≤ ±20 and total mass ≤ 30 are violated.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Load applied at node_3 generates large tensile forces on members connected to it. The presence of a load node between supports and asymmetrical higher nodes causes stress concentration, especially on residues members crossing the bearing from node_3 to node_5. Existing members with large cross sections contribute to overall mass >30. Lack of good triangulation and effective load path from node_3 down to supports results in failure. The history shows an earlier configuration with larger mass but slightly lower max stress. The simpler triangular structure (constraint_not_met_3) has too little mass but very high max stress of 60+. Mass reduction has led to overstressed members, indicating need for better triangulation and balanced cross sections.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key insights: enforce symmetry for even load distribution; relocate some top nodes closer or better aligned to reduce member lengths yet preserve enough height for load transfer; add triangulation diagonals connecting top nodes and bottom nodes for better force paths; assign moderate size cross-sectional areas to avoid large peak stresses; keep load and supports fixed. Mass allocation must be minimized on less stressed members and enhanced on high load trajectories.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign a trapezoidal truss with 5 nodes: supports fixed at node_1 (0,0) and node_2 (6,0), load fixed at node_3 (2,0). Two upper nodes repositioned moderately to create semi-symmetric top chord spaced to enable triangulation. Connect all nodes in closed form with verticals and diagonals to triangulate the form. Assign cross-section areas from the given discrete set prioritized from small (0.195 - 1) to medium (1.759 - 3.128) ensuring max stress constraint while keeping reduced mass under 30.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation greatly increases stiffness reducing peak stresses; semi-symmetric topology balances force flow; shortening member lengths reduces weight and stress; top nodes positioned near projections minimize eccentric stress effects; cross section assigned larger in primary inclined members and smaller in verticals for mass efficiency.
