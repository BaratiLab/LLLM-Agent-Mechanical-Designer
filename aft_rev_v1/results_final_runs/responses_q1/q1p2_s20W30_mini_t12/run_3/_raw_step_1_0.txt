The goal is to generate a closed 2D truss that satisfies stress and mass constraints while providing adequate stiffness and load distribution.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "The given load is a 10-unit force on node_3 at 45° downward left, supported by pinned node_1 and roller node_2 on ground line y=0. Current max compressive stress on member_4 (node_1-node_3) is about -60, which heavily violates stress constraints. Mass is safe at 13.37 < 30. The structure is a \'kite/tent\' shape but has over-stressed diagonal member. The structure is not symmetric w.r.t load path leading to high stresses.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Load applies a tensile and compressive bending pattern on the lower chord (nodes 1,2,3 line). Members connected to node_4 (apex) transfer load but the slender central bottom chord member is heavily compressed. History shows the highest stress is on this short bottom diagonal chord (node_1-node_3). The triangle formed (nodes 1,3,4) has an unbalanced geometry and member sizing resulting in stress concentrations and poor load redistribution. The smaller cross-section on the highly stressed member likely inadequately resists load. A closed truss with proper triangulation and symmetry can better distribute forces and reduce maximum stress while maintaining low mass. Additional members to form more triangles and better stiffness paths around load application point are needed. The structure can be improved by repositioning node_4, adding diagonal members, and adjusting cross sections.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key failure is high compressive stress on a single bottom chord member. Symmetry on supports and load line, as well as triangulation, would improve performance. The apex node requires repositioning for better load distribution with respect to load on node_3. Introducing a bottom joint at the load node to directly support the load via other members reduces stress concentration. Using larger cross sections on critical members and smaller on less stressed members will optimize mass. Ensuring the closed loop with an efficient triangular framework is paramount for stress redistribution.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss using 5 nodes to form a trapezoidal prism with a strong triangular bracing system. Add node_5 above node_3 elevating y to form better triangulation and load path with all bottom-line nodes supported. Use quadrant symmetric members, including new diagonals (node_3-node_5, node_2-node_5, node_1-node_5) to balance load. Keep node_1 and node_2 fixed for supports, node_3 fixed for load application point. Assign cross-sectional areas increasing in anticipated compression members and maintain moderate mass. This creates closed loops and strong, stable triangulated bracing on loaded node_3.",\n    "reasoning": "Symmetry and triangulated closed framed truss will reduce stresses. Support nodes fixed. Load at node_3 transferred directly to supports via top nodes. Node_5 placed near node_3 upward to split and overcome large compression. Members between nodes create triangles: (1-3-5), (3-5-2), (1-4-5), (2-4-5) and bottom chord connects 1-3-2 (with new 5 acting as intermediate). Basic static equilibrium sets member forces; diagonal members relieve compressive load in main chords improving stress distribution. Cross-sectional areas chosen per stress capacity. Mass predicted as sum lengths × area ≤ 30. Nodes 4 and 5 added to improve vertical and diagonal channels.
