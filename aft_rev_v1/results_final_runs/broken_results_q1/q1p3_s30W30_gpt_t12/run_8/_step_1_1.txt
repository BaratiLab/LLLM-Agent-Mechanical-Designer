The current design exceeds allowable stress (49.56 > 30) and is not optimally triangulated for load distribution. The optimization must generate a structurally closed, efficiently connected truss, keeping all loads/supports at original given nodes.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: closed (fully triangulated), 2D truss (min mass/stress, all constraints met); Constraints: max |stress|≤30, total mass≤30; Inputs: nodes/supports/loads to remain, but may add nodes for closure. Historical structure fails stress constraint, likely due to a weak midspan member with small area and poor triangulation.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current layout: nodes 1 (pinned, [0,0]), 2 (roller, [6,0]), 3 ([2,0]), 4 ([3,2.5]). Load (-10, -45deg) at node_3 implies strong diagonal force, likely putting member_5 (node_1-node_3) into high compression/tension (found: stress = -49.56), exceeding area 1\'s capacity. Lack of lower polygon closure (between nodes 1, 3, 2) means force flow is not efficiently triangulated, causing excessive force in a few members. Previous members all present (including vertical diagonals for triangulation), but load distribution is poor, as seen in historical FEM analysis. Stress violations mainly in member_5. Mass is far below limit (10.55≪30), so increasing area is acceptable. Structure is technically closed, but load paths are not optimal: bottom chord is too thin for moment induced by eccentric (inclined) load. Structure also relatively shallow, which produces higher chord forces for a given span and vertical height.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "To keep key nodes\' positions, add or redistribute area for the most critical overloaded members. Current issue: midspan (member node_1<>node_3), high compression/tension, requires a much larger area to bring stress ≤30. Consider also modest redistribution of node_4 slightly higher for a taller truss (bigger depth → lower chord force), or add horizontal member between node_3-node_4 to force path via triangle. Still, simple area increase plus slight top node move will likely suffice, since current mass is very low.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign to reinforce the weakest member (node_1-node_3) via larger area and/or relocate node_4 for increased truss height, maximizing moment-arm for load. Also improving bottom chord by splitting member_5 and adding diagonal (horizontal tie: node_4–node_3) to better close the polygon—creating two active triangles: {node_1, node_3, node_4}, {node_2, node_4, node_3}. This matches classic \'crown-truss\' or trapezoidal sections for a 3-pin right-hand span.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Symmetry and triangulation: shallow trusses force large chord forces; increasing vertical depth at node_4 (apex) lowers these, distributing load better. Adding diagonal/tie (node_3<>node_4) ensures both sides of truss are closed triangles maximizing stiffness. Enlarging the most stressed member\'s area directly reduces excessive stress while still remaining well below total mass limit. By raising node_4 from y=2.5 to y=3.7, and promoting area for critical member (area_id \'5\'), all constraints can be met.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Major load transfer via lower chord (node_1–node_3: member_5). At -45°, load at node_3 splits equally: Fx=Fy=-7.07 each. Member_5\'s original stress >49, needs |stress|≤30: required area increase by at least 49.56/30=1.65. Area_id \'5\'  = 4.887 is 5× current, more than enough (check total mass). For member_1/6 (bottom), some tension; member_2,3,4 moderate compression/tension, so area_id \'2\' (0.782) will suffice (8× less than max). Mass: Mass = sum(L × A). Main long chord is node_1–node_3: L=2m × 4.887=9.77, rest L≈2–3+m × 0.782=~8, total < 20.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Target max |stress| = 30. Required for member_5 (node_1–node_3): area = Load/stress = (49.56*x)/30 × old_area(). Set area_id=\'5\' (A=4.887). Update node_4 to y=3.7 for deeper truss; member_2,3,4 area_id=\'2\' (A=0.782), member_1,6 area_id=\'2\', member_5 elevated to area_id=\'5\'. Add member_7 node_3–node_4 (horizontal +) with area_id=\'2\'. Compute new mass and check force distribution: L(node_1-node_3)=2.0m; rest up to 3.7. Mass ≈ 2*0.782*3 + 1*4.9*2 = ~15.
