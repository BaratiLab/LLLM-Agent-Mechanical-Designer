The goal is to identify an optimal, closed, efficient, and constraint-compliant truss, minimizing stress and total mass under given design limits.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "We have three primary nodes forming a base segment (node_1-node_2-node_3), with node_3 receiving a substantial diagonal force. Goal is to create a fully connected closed truss (minimum: 3 nodes, but possibly more), distribute the load efficiently, and maintain equilibrium. Maximizing efficiency suggests adding at least one new node to triangulate and close this minimal system.",\n\n    "analysis": "The truss needs to channel a sizeable inclined force from node_3 to both supports, so direct path triangulation is ideal. The three given nodes lie on x=0,y=0 (node_1), x=6,y=0 (node_2), x=2,y=0 (node_3). Connecting these directly creates a nondeterminate line—suggesting high member forces. To triangulate efficiently and close the truss, we can place a new node above the base to create a triangle—say, node_4 at the logical centroid above (x ~ 3.0, y > 0). Members from node_3 and both supports to node_4 close the shape and offer path redundancy. Constraint consideration: maximum allowed stress ±30, total mass <=30, areas limited to listed IDs. Member cross sectional areas need to be minimal for low mass but adequate for stress control.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation offers both closure and load capacity. Overly long or thin members risk overstress; bulky ones violate mass bounds. Node_4 height should balance force spread—midpoint between node_1 and node_2, and y such that member stresses on inclined supports don\'t quickly exceed ±30. Approximate y=2 gives good spread, acceptable geometry for minimizing both force in individual limbs and total mass. Connect: node_1-node_3-node_2-base (closed), plus node_4 connected to node_1, node_2, and node_3 (for triangulation, forming two-triangle chain: nodes (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4)).",\n\n    "reasoning": "By selecting node_4 at (3.0,2.0), we effectuate symmetric triangulation matched to load angle (~-45° at node_3). Load from node_3 can now split equally or proportionally into each supporting member in a more efficient force path than the original linear chain. Members are chosen for: 1) shortest, most direct transfer for minimum weight; 2) orientation optimal to carry inclined force. All base nodes remain, closure and redundancy are enforced. Select smallest viable area IDs using primary stress constraint.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Member list: (1,2-base), (1,3), (2,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). For a closed structure, use truss theory to estimate axial loads. Load at node_3 at -45°, split by angle between members; vertical support at node_1 (pinned), horizontal at node_2 (roller); assume equal area on main force-carrying members at node_3 for stress check. Area selection: try \'2\' (0.782) on main triangles. For each member, compute length, then axial force (resolve forces at node_3 and project along connected members—use trigonometry for the ~2:1 aspect between direct triangles), then stress, and finally mass = sum(length × area). If all members pass stress ≤30 and total mass ≤30, design is feasible. Iterative area upscaling if stress exceeds bound. Assume E (Young modulus) high—focus on stress not deflection. Ignore buckling since all computed stresses well within bounds and truss is triangulated. Critical candidate members: node_3 to node_4; node_3 to base supports.",\n\n    "calculation": """ \n    1.
