The objective is to form a statically-determinate, fully-connected (triangulated) truss minimizing stress and total mass, without exceeding ±30 stress or 30 mass units. Area selection uses the provided discrete area set.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes: two supports (node_1: pinned, node_2: roller) and one with a diagonal load (node_3). All nodes along the x-axis; load at node_3 is downward and leftward (-45°). Minimize stress and mass by choosing areas and member layout connecting all nodes.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Triangulated form is needed for closure and efficient load path. Direct members: (1-2), (1-3), (2-3) forms triangle. The external force at node_3 produces substantial axial force, especially compression in (1-3) and tension in (2-3). Two direct supports reduce mechanism; direct connective layout is efficient.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Assessing force flow, (1-3) and (2-3) will carry most of the load from diagonal. Member (1-2) will remain in equilibrium under chosen support reactions. Using minimum required area IDs ensures mass is minimized without overstressing. Three members make this truss isostatic and closed.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangular truss is statically determinate and optimizes the given requirements. Additional nodes are unnecessary; triangulation there is canonical here. Choosing moderate area_id values may be required, as area_id \'0\'/1 likely too small for large input force.
