Current and earlier proposed structures violate the stress constraint, indicating either too-light or inefficient triangulation/distribution.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: Find a minimal-mass yet closed truss under supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller), with a large inclined load at node_3. Constraint violations stem from local overstress or under-triangulation causing inefficient force paths. All member areas and node positions except supports/loads can be adjusted.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structures tend to minimize mass through minimal sections, pushing several bars dramatically into overstress when challenged by the diagonal load. Designs in history closely hug the minimum mass threshold, but stress often exceeds ±30, with member_2 or corresponding tension/compression diagonals consistently over the limit (-43.6, -60.4, etc.). Context shows only the heavily overbuilt historic structure grossly satisfied stress (<10) but at more than 3× mass constraint. This makes clear that internal triangles and/or symmetry advancing load flow to both supports, with both verticals and diagonals, are missing or insufficiently robust. Key area IDs must also be raised for members in direct load path. Further, node_5\'s positioning height and base width influence bar lengths/stress.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Pattern: Overstressed diagonals linked to load path (node_3). Designs lacked internal triangulation and force splitting. Well-distributed force into more members/alternate paths and tuned sectional areas per stress profile is critical. Node_3\'s overloading must be split via both vertical and diagonals and constrained over an expanded, well-proportioned top chord. Slightly raising bar areas selectively in high-action members is less costly than global oversizing. Maintain truss \'closure\' via inter-member triangles.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign current structure: Keep pinned and roller supports (node_1 and node_2) and applied load on node_3. Adjust node_5 upward slightly to leverage better force redirection, and introduce a sixth node (node_6) as an upper chord, forming two adjoining triangular zones for redundancy. Members will connect from base supports and load point into node_5 and node_6 with crisscrossed diagonals, optimizing both load distribution and producing a string of closed triangles spanning the truss. Appropriately size members per local stress estimates. Avoid excessive area everywhere, focus on main paths.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Increased internal triangulation and two overlapping top nodes (forming twin load triangles above node_3/4) split and neutralize the inclined load force more evenly into competitive force paths. This divides tension/compression responsibilities, thus keeping no single bar overstressed. Slightly higher top nodes allow reasonable angle/truss depth for diagonal efficiency. Select minimum areas for outlying/compression-only bars and increased area for high-tension diagonals and accretive top chords. Member choices/higher areas reflect mechanical stress corridors.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: \n    - Bar allowable stress = ±30\n    - External load magnitude 10 kN at -45° impacts diagonal and vertical elements.\n    - All supports/nodes remain at clean integer/float positions for geometry.\n    - Use 1.0 (area_id=0) in minor bars, choose stronger sections (area_id=2 to 4) in main diagonals, checking length×area sum stays ≤30 mass.\n    Equations: \n    > Resolve external force at node_3 via projection to bases at node_1 and node_2 (static equations).\n    > Diagonal bars from nodes_3 to apexes transfer bulk of force.\n    > Top and outboard bars as \'load sharing\' and formation members do not get high fractions of force,\n    Steps: \n    - Raise node_5 above center (approximately [2.5, 3.8]); introduce symmetric node_6 at higher elevation ([4.0, 3.7]), forming a broader triangle.\n    - Main members: all bases to both node_5 and node_6, bases across bottom, all diagonals,"\n    "calculation": "\n    Geometry:\n    node_1: [0.0, 0.0]    (pinned support)\n    node_2: [6.0, 0.0]    (roller support)\n    node_3: [2.0, 0.0]    (load - input spec: not to be moved!)\n    node_4: [4.0, 0.0]    (bottom chord, support for triangles)\n    node_5: [2.7, 3.4]    (slightly left up, height for leeway in sum(lengths*areas).
