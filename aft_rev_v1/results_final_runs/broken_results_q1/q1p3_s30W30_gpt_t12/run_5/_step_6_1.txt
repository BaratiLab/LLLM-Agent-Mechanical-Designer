Previous designs failed at stress (|σ| ≤ 30) or mass (≤ 30) constraints. The aim is to create a lightweight but efficient, closed (fully triangulated) 2D truss, with minimum member stresses and total mass, while adhering strictly to area selection and without altering boundary-support or loaded nodes.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Target: Maintain stresses below ±30 and mass below 30 by careful use of node placements, multiple force paths (triangulation), and minimal member areas. Current/historic structures fail mainly at over-stressed/super-light local members. Load at node_3 is significant (-10 kN, -45°, ~7.07 kN X+Y); highest stresses occur in classic triangles supported by a tall middle. Need more force distribution or shortcuts / tympanic bracing.",\n\n    "analysis": "Upper node positions (e.g., [3, 2], [3, 3.8] or [3, 4.6]) have aimed to create increased truss height for better force triangulation, but at the cost of mass. Too-plane (flat) triangles lead to axial overload (seen as |σ| > 40). Over-triangulation (see super-massive structure with node_6 at [3, 4.6]) drove up mass. Under-triangulation leads to minimal mass, but stress leaks past constraint. Nodal re-use is efficient if tight triangulation persists. Placing the top node at or somewhat above ~2.5 slightly shortens hypotenuse members (which classically overload under load closer to midspan), balancing mass vs. stress. Structural efficiency is likely maximized at a moderate upper-node height with full perimeter-and-diagonal closure so loads can diffuse over three load paths (like a roof truss).",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Constraint-exceeding states show members immediately above/below node_3 becoming major stress cliffs; sloped mid-height upper nodes can dice stress (local triangles must be always be present at the loading point). Historic masses beyond 30 arise from multiple upper nodes—a single top node, optimized height, and diagonal webbing is optimal for closed space/force, unless the upper chord extension is justified.",\n\n    "proposal": "Modify the current five-node structure—maintain nodes at supported and load points (don\'t move node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4, node_5), but add a single new upper node above node_3 for better stress splitting. This node gives two vertical triangles on either side. Further, route diagonals from supports and abutments to balance the primary force and extend web closure, using area IDs minimums where force/stress values are moderate, and upsize if max stress at hot spots requires. Plan for diagonals from upper nodes to midspan and ends. Close all zones: no node is left with only two connections. Choose offsets/photo-geometry carefully to not overdo panel width or vertical height.",\n\n    "reasoning": "By providing an additional, slightly elevated, and lateral (±x from center) node for triangulation above node_3, the load will distribute into at least three major paths before returning to supports. Principle: truss optimization often prefers \'long base, short height, closed triangulation.\' The added bracing diagonals lower midspan stress peaks and enforce spread load geometry, keeping max |σ| reasonable. Member area IDs must be minimum for distributed/short/low-stress members, but modestly increased at highly loaded diagonals. Too many nodes or oversized upper triangle wastes mass but eliminating them increases stress. Loop closure ensures structural redundancy.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume Young\'s modulus and identical yield tension/compression. Assume nodal vertical/horizontal projections for simplification. Approximate nodal vertical: 2.65 as above 2.0 gives better splitting per diagrams; biases at ~2.65 push more chord force diagonally. Pre-calculate member lengths and estimate force by examining possible force paths (panel points) from statics. Assign area_id: zone around loaded node? Up to \'3\', most elsewhere minimum (\'1\', \'2\'). Pre-assignment mass sum: keep no more than twelve members each typically less than 2.5 kgs, mean ~1.7 kgs =~ 20.4 kgs fundamentally. Key triangles: left and right around node_3. Full closure from each top node (above node_3) to both supports and all midbases. Diagonal bracing—a classical Warren/triple-braced roof.",\n\n    "calculation": "Estimate main horizontal and vertical chord members as major carriers, diagonals as stress splitters (initially analyze with statics sum of forces; experience shows peak stress is typically about P/(minimum projected area)). Placing upper node at node_6 = (3.00, 2.65) tightens the midspan load geometry (height: 2.65 vs width 6). Compute critical vertical projection components. E.g., a member from (2,0) to (3,2.65): length=sqrt(1^2+2.65^2)=2.83. Assign area_id \'3\' (1.759) here as physically much safer. Noncritical members length * area yield much less loaded zones; assign area_id \'2\'. Add necessary diagonals and closers to ensure complete force revolution. Compute total mass: sum (length*area) est for all thirteen members, verify sum ≤30, adjust up/down area if member stress is over ±30; more triangles can reduce stress but also increase overall mass. No member with less than three connections on structure—diagram check for closure. Estimate member maximum stress on likely overloaded diagonal; area_id tunable.\',\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Members from new node_6 at (3.00,2.65) to all base nodes (node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4) and the pre-existing node_5 (central upper) are all included to create maximal closure. Full connection from each loaded and supported node to upper closures. Assign area_id \'2\' (typical) for moderate load, \'3\' for direct load transfer paths. Project total mass—should fall below 25. Estimate that no member will have axial force more than 18 assuming closure and three load repartition. If needed, can upgrade select member areas by at most one tier (e.g., \'2\' to \'3\'). Will choose the shortest logical bracing intervals. Confirm again: each node, including the new one, has minimum triple connection, especially all major supported/loaded, for closure.
