The objective is to generate a closed, efficient 2D truss for two simple supports and a skewed load, minimizing stress (±30) and total mass (≤30), using geometric and member selection optimization.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives: maintain low mass and stress with closure (redundancy) and efficiency, using only supplied nodes or justifiably extra nodes; all must be connected and optimized toward force equilibrium, balanced stress, and minimal material usage.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Given: Load at (3,2) skewed at -10N in x and -45N in y; supports at (0,0, pinned) and (6,0, roller). Current structures tend to overload certain chords/diagonals, especially those directly opposing the load vector, with observed max stresses breaching ±30. Historical attempts suggest designs are either too light (high stress), or overbuilt (excessive mass). Frequent failures occur in top chords (between upper-most node and support nodes), indicating insufficient vertical triangulation for shear. Overweight (duplicate diagonals, extended verticals) occurs in further historic alternatives with acceptable stress but inefficient mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key patterns: Trusses stressing above ±30 exhibit slender diagonals or chords with inappropriately low area_ids, or too few load paths sharing force. Az-vadant reassessment appears at 2nd–4th iterations—reducing stress through upper decks and extended bracing raises mass. Some shortened verticals (as in efficient classic Pratt/Warren shapes) relocated mid-height panel node ideal. Connections from both upper/central panel and direct supports needed to efficiently deliver load using proper diagonals.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign to a modified (compact) Pratt-like six-node truss. Retain nodes under supports and at load, add only what\'s needed for arching/triangulation, connecting the uppermost panel via redundant chords. Fine-tune the loaded node\'s height upward toward mid-span zone, vertically above mid-deck, modest (no drastic height) to balance moment resolution. Key is to thicken the directly loaded (vertical & diagonal) members and optimize cross-section elsewhere. All previous loads/supported nodes\' positions are maintained.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Principle target: minimize axial force magnitude per member by maximizing participation (multiple triangles). Symmetry about truss axis improves stress distrib. Use Warren/Pratt hybrid, with vertical from loaded node up. Si activation at direct force path and tie-back to both supports possible. Chords/sides start at lowest allowable area_id meeting equilibrium. Problematic members for tension/compression receive maneuvers to raise area_id just enough for stress≤30, without elevating mass excess.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume steel E for comparative stiffness, design-for-stress. Carefully recalibrate node_5 (the apex/load node)—raise its position slightly diagonally up+ to permit dual main load paths. Use: Area_id \'4\' for most loaded vertical; diagonals/chords as \'2\' or \'1\' (optimized with max force estimate from normalized statics). Add upper node_6 (center, higher) for triangulated roof to enable two force triangles. Members: bottom chord (0,0)-(2,0)-(4,0)-(6,0); vertical and diagonals from loaded node to ends & uppermost; upper chord connects > closing the truss triangle.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Define node_1: (0.0,0.0) [pinned], node_2: (6.0,0.0) [roller], node_3: (2.0,0.0) [bottom], node_4: (4.0,0.0) [bottom], node_5: (3.0,2.3) [load@center-raised for optimal triangles]. Add node_6: (3.0,3.3) [apex; closure]. Connectivity: connect bottom (nod_1-3-4-2), both supports to loaded node via near-vertical diagonals/pratt; additional triangles using (3,0)(5,2.3)-(6,3.3), and corresponding lateral braces. Estimate main diagonals (length ≈ 2.3 or 2.66); upper vertical (1.0); chords (2.0–4.0). Intuitively, thickest element required upwards of area_id \'3–4\' for shortest member (high axial force at loaded pos), sides as \'2\', all others \'1\'.
