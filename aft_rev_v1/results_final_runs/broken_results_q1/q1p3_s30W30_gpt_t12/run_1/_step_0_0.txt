Objective is to keep all bar stresses within ±30 and total mass ≤30, while ensuring all nodes are connected and the structure is statically admissible.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": \n        "Inputs include 3 nodes at: node_1 (0,0): pinned, node_2 (6,0): roller, node_3 (2,0): 10kN force at -45°. All supports/fixed nodes must be unmoved. Admissible area_id choices range from area=0.195 to 19.548, only per the lookup table. All nodes must be in a connected, closed loop for adequate stability. Target: Add at minimum 1 node to allow triangulation and stress splitting but still minimize mass and stress.",\n\n    "analysis": \n        "A linear chain (1–3–2) can’t be a stable 2D closed truss; closure/triangulation is needed. With the angled load at node_3 pointing downward-left, and only nodes 1 and 2 fixed at y=0, a direct triangle (nodes 1–2–3, closed) would carry large moments and potential stress peaks if only those three nodes are used. Introducing a 4th node above the base (such as node_4 at the vertical plane above node_3) will allow for triangulation, better geometry, and more load spreading among bars. Loads should then be fed down through multiple load paths, reducing member stress. Critical members are the ones meeting at node_3 (the load application).",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": \n        "Observing the truss with nodes only on baseline: excessive force concentration and poor vertical/lateral stability; supports both on y=0. We need at least a 4th node, placed above simply-spanned bar, centered for symmetry, e.g. at about (2.0, 2.0) or close, for reasonable vertical and horizontal force diffusion. Triangulate node_3 upwards and down to the base for proper stress distribution—and close loop at node_1–node_2. Placing node_4 nearly over node_3 utilizes height to break up spans without overextending member length.",\n\n    "reasoning": \n        "Use classic triangular practice; connect nodes for shortest load path under given geometry (diagonal braces from supports up to a load-carrying point, load node to apex and base, and close back). Ensure all 4 nodes are connected forming two triangles, yielding higher stability and spreading the force across 5 members. Assign area_ids based on stress demand: low for outer members, heavier for members directly taking load at node_3 to keep stress under +/–30 limit. Coordinates of node_4 (2.0, 2.0) keep symmetry for force vectors, result in moderate bar length for minimal additional mass.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": \n        "Set up coordinates: node_4 (2.0, 2.0).

Compute approximate member forces using geometry and load/applied angle: member 3-4 (vertical), 1-4 and 2-4 (braced diagonals). Assign minimum area so resultant force/area ≤30.
