The goal is to redesign a closed 2D truss with the given loads/supports so that max stress is within ±20 and total mass ≤ 30, minimizing weight while ensuring structural feasibility.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Existing nodes are on a horizontal base with one node elevated (node_4) forming a triangle and a small interior node_3. Load is at node_3 (middle lower), supports at nodes_1 and_2 on ends. Current members form a simple triangular truss with some interior diagonals. Max stress >20 indicates overstressed members, likely near loaded node_3. Mass is under max, so cross section sizes or geometry can be refined.",\n\n  "analysis": "Load: -10 at node_3, at -45°, thus force components Fx = -7.07, Fy = -7.07 (down-left). Supports: node_1 pinned (all directions restrained), node_2 roller (vertical restrained). The base nodes are at (0,0) and (6,0), with node_3 at (2,0) and node_4 at (2,3). Members mostly connect base and top nodes. Overstressed member_2 (node_1-node_3) has very high compression (-26.99). Possibly due to poor load path to supports, and low cross section area (0.195). Member_1 is very large area (3) but underutilized. The triangular configuration is a basic truss but load at node_3 causes too high stress in short members near it. The structure is minimally triangulated and closed but inefficiently carrying load. Adding more triangulation by moving node_3 higher or adding nodes might help distribute forces better. Perhaps reposition node_3 upward (preserving supports and load node) to reduce stress in compressed members. Also adjust member areas - third criterion can help balance mass and stress.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "There is clear need to redistribute load path by increasing vertical distance of node_3 from base. Current node_3 on base line under load causes large compression in adjacent members from node_1 to node_3. Increasing the vertical coordinate of node_3 gives better triangulation and load transfer. Also, ensure all members have adequate cross-sectional area from area_id set without excessive mass. Choose an area scheme that balances stress but keeps total mass < 30. Consider adding more diagonal members for stiffness and load sharing. Closed truss with four nodes is possible, but adding a 5th node higher up might better reduce peak stress.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add one more node elevated near node_3 to create two triangles on left side, keep node_4 as the top right node, retain node_1 and node_2 at base supports. Elevate node_3 vertically to 1.5 from 0. Connect node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_3-new_node_5, node_5-node_4 for better triangulation. Reassign cross section areas optimizing stress distribution and minimizing total mass. This redesign keeps structure closed, increases vertical geometry around loaded node, minimizes max stress and keeps total mass below 30.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Increasing vertical node_3 redistributes load from being concentrated on single short member into multiple angled members, reducing compression. Adding node_5 elevated slightly to the right from node_3 creates further triangulation and reduces stress in members between node_3 and node_4. By assigning moderate cross section area values from area_id (e.g. 1.759 to 3.128) to main load path members, high stress is alleviated without large mass increase. The pin and roller supports remain fixed so no movement of node_1 and node_2. Load node_3 is raised to better distribute vertical and horizontal force components. Triangulated closed shape improves stability and stiffness.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic axial members, load fully transferred at loaded node, weight proportional to sum(length × area).
