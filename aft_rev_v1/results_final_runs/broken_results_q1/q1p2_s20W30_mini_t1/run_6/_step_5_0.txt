Objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss that satisfies max stress ≤ ±20 and mass ≤ 30, maintaining given loads and supports, minimizing stress and mass for optimal performance.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Input shows a 4-node truss with a downward-left load on node_3, pinned support at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current design fails mass and stress constraints. History reveals attempts with varying node 4 heights and member sizes, but no feasible design under 30 mass found. Load applied at node_3 between supports tightens stress on diagonal member connecting node_3-node_4 (high compressive stress).",\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-10 N, -45°) induces tension/compression in diagonals from node_3 up to node_4 and across bottom chord. Current mass excess due to large cross sections needed to reduce stress. History shows small node_4 height (<4.0) leads to high stress (up to 39), taller node_4 reduces stress but increases mass. Members 1 and 5 are frequently highly stressed. Current bottom chord (node_1-node_2) carries some force but has minimal area (area_id \'1\') yielding low capacity. The truss is a quadrilateral with diagonals; optimization requires balancing geometry to distribute forces more evenly, possibly adding a center node to reduce member lengths and force concentration. Closed structure must fully connect all nodes. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) fix lower chord, load at node_3 (interior bottom-chord node) adds bending challenge. Member sizing from available area_ids must balance mass and stress constraints.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Insight suggests reducing member lengths and improving triangulation to reduce stresses. Current node_4 at y≈3.8 is good for stability but mass is high. Introducing an additional node over node_3 midpoint, lifting it slightly to improve triangulation and distribute load better could reduce peak stresses. Enlarging bottom chord area and diagonals moderately to balance compression and tension forces may reduce max stress below 20. Aim to keep total mass below 30 by using mostly smaller cross sections but with selective upsizing on most stressed members. Node_3 coordinate must be fixed as load is applied there, likewise supports vertical positions are fixed.",\n    "proposal": "Redesign truss with 5 nodes by adding a new top node above node_3 to improve triangulation and load path. Fix node_1 and node_2 at (0.0, 0.0) and (6.0, 0.0), node_3 at (2.0, 0.0) with load. Introduce node_4 at (4.0, 0.0) for better bottom chord support and node_5 at (3.0, 4.0) to form two triangular shapes sharing mid-span. Members connect nodes as edges of triangles: bottom chord (1-3-4-2), roof diagonals and verticals (1-5, 3-5, 4-5, 2-5). Assign areas to achieve balance: larger areas in high compression diagonals, moderate areas in tension members, minimum in bottom chord. This closed, two-triangle setup spreads load and limits member lengths. Mass will be reduced due to shorter members and optimized sections.",\n    "reasoning": "The added node_5 at (3.0,4.0) forms two triangles with bottom chord nodes, improving load distribution and stiffness. Triangulation ensures stable structure. Supports at nodes 1 and 2 fix the bottom chord, load at node 3 is in middle bottom chord, better resisted by the two triangles above. Vertical and diagonal members split tensile and compressive forces, reducing individual member stress. Using area_id sizes from \'1\' (0.195) to \'5\' (4.887) selectively allows mass control. Bottom chord kept minimal yet enough to carry bending forces. Triangles reduce moments and increase axial force efficiency. Node 4 added at (4,0) splits bottom chord to reduce member length and stress. This is an established, efficient truss form with minimal mass.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: uniform cross-section members, steel-like linear elastic behavior, axial-only member forces.
