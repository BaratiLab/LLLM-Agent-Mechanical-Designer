Objective is to minimize max stress further under stress ≤ +/- 20 and mass ≤ 30, keeping a closed truss.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Current structure: node_1 and node_2 are supports; load at node_3. Current max stress 13.56 < 20 and mass 13.38 < 30. Members connect nodes to form a trapezoidal truss with one internal node (node_3) on base. Area varies from 0.195 to 7.037 in use, which affects stress and mass. History shows attempts with node_4 coords changing, some violated stress constraints.",\n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 with downward-left force leads to compression in member_1 (node_1-node_3) and tension in member_2 (node_3-node_2). Members connecting node_4 provide triangulation preventing collapse. Current stress distribution: member_1 highest compression (-13.56); member_3 under tension (7.54). Area choices in current design: member_2 uses smallest area "1"(0.195), potentially causing higher stress. Current design is efficient with stable geometry: base fixed, upper node providing closure. Generation history shows node_4 position change inducing stress spikes, suggesting fixed node_4 at (3.0,4.0) is optimal for force distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress concentrated mostly in member_1, partly in member_2 and member_4. Mass is well below limit. To reduce max stress, increase cross-sectional area of highest stressed members (member_1) while reducing areas elsewhere to not increase mass much. Node positions at supports and load fixed; node_4 can be slightly fine-tuned vertically to improve load path but previous trials show risk of constraint violation. Best to keep node_4 position and topology same. Possibly adjust member_2 area up slightly from 0.195 to 0.782 for better stress distribution.",\n  "proposal": "Retain current node positions for supports and load. Fix node_4 at (3.00, 4.00). Increase member_1 area from \'2\'(0.782) to \'3\'(1.759) to lower compressive stress. Slightly increase member_2 area from \'1\'(0.195) to \'2\'(0.782) for tension reduction. Keep members 3,4,5 at area \'2\'(0.782) unchanged for balanced mass. This will reduce max stress and maintain mass < 30. No node position change except confirmed fixed nodes. This slight remodeling of areas will optimize stresses.",\n  "reasoning": "Increasing cross-sectional area on members with highest stresses reduces stress proportionally. Member_1 has highest negative stress, so raising its area cuts stress magnitude nearly by half. Member_2 with smaller area supports tension load; increasing area reduces its stress significantly. Keeping node_4 fixed ensures structural stability and force path. This maintains closed topology. Mass increase is limited as increase spread among few members. Members 3,4,5 have moderate stress, so area kept moderate to control mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.00 m, node_3-node_2 = 4.00 m, node_1-node_4 ~ 5.0 m (from (0,0) to (3,4)), node_3-node_4 ~ 4.12 m, node_2-node_4 = 4.47 m. Member stresses inversely proportional to area: stress_new = stress_old * (area_old / area_new). Mass as sum(length_i * area_i * density assumed unit). Verify max stress < 20 and total mass < 30. Previous mass 13.39. New area settings: member_1 area \'3\' = 1.759, member_2 area \'2\' = 0.782, others \'2\' = 0.782. Mass_new ~ sum(length_i*area_i) = (2*1.759) + (4*0.782) + (5*0.782) + (4.12*0.782) + (4.47*0.782) = 3.518 +3.128 +3.910+3.224 +3.497= ~17.28 < 30.
