The current and historic designs all violate the max stress constraint (|stress| ≤ 30) and/or mass constraint (mass ≤ 30). The objective is to generate a closed, efficient truss that satisfies both constraints, minimizes peak stress, and keeps mass low.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Goal: Closed truss, all nodes connected, |stress| ≤ 30, total mass ≤ 30. Load at node_3 (-10 kN @ -45°), supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). All previous structures are either too light (high stress) or too heavy (low stress, but inefficient). Need to balance member sizing and triangulation for efficiency.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current structure (iteration 10/25) and all historic attempts fail due to excessive member stress (often in the range 34–60), or excessive mass (35–75). The load at node_3 is significant and angled, so both vertical and horizontal equilibrium must be addressed. The support arrangement creates a clear span between node_1 and node_2 (6 m). Members with area_id=\'1\' (A=0.195) are too small, causing high stresses. Attempts to reduce stress by increasing area or adding members have resulted in excessive mass. Many historic designs lack efficient triangulation or optimal node placement, leading to inefficient force paths and overloaded members. A closed, triangulated truss with an additional top chord and optimized diagonals can improve load distribution, reduce member forces, and allow use of moderate member areas.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Diagonal bracing is essential to distribute the oblique load efficiently. Key nodes should be placed to create short, direct load paths from node_3 to supports. Avoid long, slender members prone to high stress. Use moderate area members (area_id=\'2\', \'3\', \'4\') for main load paths, and lighter members elsewhere. Place a new node above node_3 to form a top chord. This will allow better triangulation and reduce forces in the bottom chord.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the structure with a Warren truss form: retain node_1, node_2, node_3, and add two upper nodes (node_4, node_5) above the span to create two triangles. This will allow for triangulation and short member lengths. Connect all nodes to create a closed structure. Assign moderate areas to main load paths, lighter areas to less critical members. This configuration will minimize peak stress and keep mass low.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A Warren truss (with top nodes) provides efficient load transfer for a single midspan load. Placing node_4 above node_3, and node_5 above the midspan between node_2 and node_3, creates direct diagonal paths for the oblique load to reach both supports. Triangulation reduces the length and force in each member, permitting use of moderate cross-sections. This configuration also avoids excessive mass, as the number of members is minimized and their lengths are short. Key design: node_4 at (2.0, 2.4) (above node_3), node_5 at (4.0, 2.0) (above the midspan right of node_3). Members: bottom chord (node_1-node_3-node_2), top chord (node_4-node_5), verticals and diagonals to form triangles.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume: E = const, load at node_3 = 10 kN @ -45°, supports at nodes 1,2. Use geometry to estimate member forces: diagonals and verticals take most load. Estimate lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0 m, node_3-node_2 = 4.0 m, node_3-node_4 = 2.4 m, node_4-node_5 ≈ 2.06 m, node_5-node_2 ≈ 2.83 m. Assign area_id=\'2\' (A=0.782) to diagonals and verticals, area_id=\'1\' (A=0.195) to less critical members. Compute member forces by resolving the load into the truss joints, ensuring no member exceeds 30 kN stress (σ = F/A). Mass = sum(length × area). Choose areas to keep mass ≤ 30.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Estimate: Main diagonals/verticals (area_id=\'2\', A=0.782), bottom/top chords (area_id=\'1\', A=0.195). For a 10 kN load at -45°, each diagonal/vertical will see up to ~7–10 kN. Stress in area_id=\'2\' members: σ = 10/0.782 ≈ 12.8 kN, well below 30. Chord members see less force. Total mass: sum(length × area) ≈ (2.0+2.0+2.4+2.06+2.83+4.0) × 0.195 + (4 × 0.782 × 2.0) ≈ 1.56 + 6.26 ≈ 7.8, well below 30.
