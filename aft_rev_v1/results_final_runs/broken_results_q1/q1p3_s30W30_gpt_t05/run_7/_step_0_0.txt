The structure must minimize maximum member stress (within ±30), keep total mass ≤ 30, and use only specified cross-sectional areas. All nodes must be connected in a closed truss, possibly with additional nodes for triangulation and load path efficiency.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three collinear nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), with a -10kN load at node_3 (2,0), supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). The direct connection would be unstable; need triangulation for a closed, stable truss. May need to add a node above the x-axis to form a triangle and allow load transfer, while using minimal area for mass constraint.",\n\n    "analysis": "The current nodes are collinear, which provides no vertical load-carrying capacity. To stabilize and close the structure, at least one node above (or below) the x-axis is required to form a stable triangle. The load at node_3 is angled (-45°), so a triangle with a new node above node_3 will allow efficient load transfer. Triangulation will also minimize member forces and stress. The supports (pinned at node_1, roller at node_2) allow horizontal and vertical reactions at node_1, and only vertical at node_2.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a node above node_3 (e.g., at (2.0, 2.5)) forms two triangles: (node_1, node_2, new_node) and (node_1, node_3, new_node). This provides a direct load path and closed truss. Member selection should favor shorter, direct members for mass efficiency. The area selection must balance between keeping stress below 30 and minimizing mass. The load path from node_3 (with an angled load) will be shared by the two adjacent members.",\n\n    "reasoning": "To minimize stress and mass, I will add a single node (node_4) at (2.0, 2.5), vertically above node_3. This creates a triangular truss: node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4, with members forming two triangles. All nodes are connected, and the structure is stable. Members will be sized for stress (≤30) and mass (≤30) using the smallest possible area IDs that satisfy stress constraints. Triangulation ensures efficient load transfer and closure. The new node location is chosen to minimize member lengths and spread the load efficiently.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume all members are pin-connected. Set up force equilibrium at nodes. The load at node_3 is -10kN at -45°, so Fx = Fy = -10/sqrt(2) ≈ -7.07kN. Estimate member forces: top chord (node_1-node_4-node_2), diagonals (node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_4). Use trigonometry to get member lengths. For each member, stress = |Force| / Area, and mass = length × area. Select minimum area_id to keep max stress ≤30, sum masses to ensure ≤30.",\n\n    "calculation": "Node positions: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (2,2.5). Member lengths: node_1-node_2 = 6.0, node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_2-node_3 = 4.0, node_1-node_4 = sqrt(2^2 + 2.5^2) ≈ 3.20, node_2-node_4 = sqrt(4^2 + 2.5^2) ≈ 4.72, node_3-node_4 = 2.5. Form closed truss with members: (node_1-node_2), (node_2-node_4), (node_4-node_1), (node_1-node_3), (node_2-node_3), (node_3-node_4). Assume worst-case member force = 10kN (load magnitude). For stress ≤30, area ≥ 10/30 = 0.333. Use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for all members. Mass = sum(length × area) = (6.0+4.72+3.20+2.0+4.0+2.5) × 0.782 ≈ 22.12, which is within the 30 limit. Check stress: max force 10kN, area 0.782, stress ≈ 12.8 < 30. All constraints satisfied.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Design is closed, triangulated, and efficient. All nodes are connected, no duplicates, all members reference unique nodes. Stress and mass constraints are satisfied. Area_id \'2\' is optimal for all members. Node_4 location provides direct load path and minimizes member lengths.
