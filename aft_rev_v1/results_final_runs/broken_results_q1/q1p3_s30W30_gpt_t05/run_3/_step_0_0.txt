The design must select from discrete cross-sectional areas and not exceed a total mass of 30 units.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes are given, forming a triangle at the base: node_1 (pinned, left), node_2 (roller, right), node_3 (between, loaded at -45°). Objective: connect all nodes with a closed truss (triangle), possibly add a fourth node for triangulation if beneficial. Must minimize mass and stress, using only allowed areas.",\n\n    "analysis": "The load at node_3 is large and acts diagonally downward/left. With only three nodes, the minimal closed truss is a triangle (nodes 1-2-3). However, this triangle may result in high stresses due to the acute angle at node_3. Adding a fourth node above node_3 could distribute forces more efficiently, reducing peak member stresses. Supports are at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller), so the structure must be stable and statically determinate or indeterminate but not overconstrained. All members must be checked for stress, and areas chosen to keep mass under 30.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "A triangle (nodes 1-2-3) is the simplest closed truss, but the acute angle at node_3 under a large oblique load may cause excessive force in members 1-3 and 2-3. Adding a fourth node above could create two triangles (1-3-4, 2-3-4), distributing load and reducing force magnitudes. Placing node_4 directly above node_3 (at y=2.5) seems structurally efficient. All members must be checked for stress and mass; member areas can be minimized except for those directly carrying the load.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Using triangulation by adding a node above node_3 (node_4 at (2.0, 2.5)) creates two triangles, which efficiently distribute forces and reduce peak member stresses. Members connecting node_3 to node_4, and node_4 to supports, will carry the majority of the load. Choose the smallest area that keeps stress below ±30 for each member. Use the lowest possible areas for members not directly on the load path to minimize mass.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All members are pin-jointed, loads are static, and material is uniform. Members: (1-3), (2-3), (1-2), (3-4), (1-4), (2-4). For each, calculate length, resolve forces at node_3 using method of joints (equilibrium). Use trigonometry to find member forces. Select area_id so that |force|/area <= 30. Sum length*area for all members to ensure mass <= 30. If stress > 30 in any member, increase area or adjust node_4 position.",\n\n    "calculation": "Node positions: node_1 (0.0, 0.0), node_2 (6.0, 0.0), node_3 (2.0, 0.0), node_4 (2.0, 2.5).
