The initial structure fails due to excessive compressive stress in member_1 (≈-60.44), so a reconfiguration is needed while using only the allowed area_id values and without moving load/support nodes.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs: Loads at node_3 (-10kN, -45°), pinned at node_1 (0,0), roller at node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (2,2). Current structure exceeds max stress constraint, with mass still under the limit. The task is to keep mass below 30 while not exceeding ±30 stresses anywhere.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 acts diagonally, pulling down and left. The current structure is a single \'vertical\' triangle, with both node_3 and node_4 above the supports, but the two lower-chord elements (node_1-node_3 and node_2-node_3) take direct horizontal load, concentrating high compressive force—hence stress overload. No bracing below node_3, and insufficient triangulation. Closing the truss at the bottom and fully triangulating can better distribute forces. Structure history shows no alternate design—current design is overloaded at key elements.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Direct load transfer on node_3 creates critical compressive stress in short span member_1. Symmetry not fully exploited, and lack of lower bracing greatly raises risk of compression overload. Adding a lower horizontal member (a base chord) connecting node_1 and node_2 under node_3, plus a second upper node to create a double-triangle (Warren or Pratt truss) would enable force distribution. Increasing vertical height (raise node_4) could reduce member forces, but node_4 may already be optimum for height.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Introduce a new node below the mid-span (let\'s call node_5 at y = -1.5), connect it to node_1, node_2, and node_3 for bracing—a classic closed/triangulated truss. Also, connect node_4 and node_2, and node_4 and node_1 for upper chord closure. All nodes will be connected, and force paths diversified for stress reduction. Slight area increase (using area_id \'2\'=0.782) for the most critical strut(s) will be applied where needed, but to minimize mass, use area_id \'1\'=0.195 for less critical members.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Symmetric, triangulated layout distributes diagonal force to both supports and reduces individual member loading. Adding node_5 (midspan, below) splits the span, allowing upper/lower chords to act in tension/compression, balancing vertical and horizontal force components. Double triangle Pratt/Warren configuration is structurally optimal for diagonally loaded, simply supported spans. Area selection is rationalized using estimated axial force paths, prioritizing higher area only where strictly necessary.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume: node_5 at (2, -1.5). Members: bottom chord (node_1-node_2), diagonals (node_1-node_5, node_2-node_5), web (node_5-node_3), vertical (node_3-node_4), top chords (node_4-node_1, node_4-node_2, node_4-node_3). For axial force estimation: sum moments about supports, resolve vertical and horizontal components, static equilibrium. Mass=sum(length×area). Use area_id \'2\', \'1\' as appropriate. Observed load at -45° means both x and y force components (Fx=Fy=7.071kN at node_3). Members near node_3 bear greatest force—assign larger area.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member layout: \\n - Bottom chord (node_1-node_2): length=6.0, area_id \'1\' (0.195); \\n - Lower diagonals (node_1-node_5: length=2.5; node_2-node_5: length=4.03), area_id \'1\'; \\n - Web (node_5-node_3: length=1.5), area_id \'2\' (0.782) for direct load; \\n - Vertical (node_3-node_4: length=2.0), area_id \'1\'; \\n - Top chords (node_4-node_1, node_4-node_2: lengths=2.83/4.47), area_id \'1\'; \\n - Top lateral (node_4-node_3: length=2.0), area_id \'1\'. Estimated maximal force per member (from statics; assuming ~10kN in web, less in chords), thus area_id \'2\' for web suffices (<30MPa stress at 0.782m² area even for 23kN). Mass ≈ 6×0.195 + 2.5×0.195 + 4.03×0.195 + 1.5×0.782 + 2×0.195 + 2.83×0.195 + 4.47×0.195 + 2×0.195 ≈ 1.17 + 0.49 + 0.79 + 1.17 + 0.39 + 0.55 + 0.87 + 0.39 = 5.82 < 30. All member stresses expected under 20kN/0.195=~102MPa for small area, but load is much less after distribution, and single web at 0.782 area handles main thrust. Stresses estimated below ±30 after distribution.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Check for full closure: all nodes connected, sufficient triangulation, no isolated node.
