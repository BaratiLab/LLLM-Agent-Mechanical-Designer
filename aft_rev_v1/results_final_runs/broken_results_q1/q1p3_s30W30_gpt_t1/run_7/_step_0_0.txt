All constraints on stress (|30|) and mass (≤30) must be met.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "The nodes are collinear and closely spaced on the x-axis, making construction of a conventional triangle impossible without adding a node. All must be connected in a closed way, and the load is strongly off-axis. The mass and stress constraints are tight, so the area selection must be efficient.",\n\n    "analysis": "Collinear layouts can\'t form a load-path-resisting triangle. A diagonally-placed \'apex\' node above (x=2,y>0) can form two strong triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_apex), (node_2, node_3, node_apex), closing the truss (all nodes directly connected). Placing the apex closer to the load ensures efficient direct force paths. Good triangle geometry distributes load so that no member is over-stressed, while minimizing unnecessary length (mass). The apex y should balance structural height vs. added mass.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Placing a single apex above node_3 (to balance load at node_3) is standard. Choose a reasonable height (~1.5 units off x-axis) to give triangles with moderate slenderness and non-excessive member length. Since supports are at nodes 1 & 2, and load is at node_3, the apex above node_3 is optimal. All existing supports stay fixed per instructions.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Symmetry is not strictly possible, but placing the new node (\'node_4\', apex) above node_3 at (2.0, 1.5) forms robust triangles. This keeps members short (helps mass) and distributes the off-axis force. Using the smallest area that keeps max stress below 30, select areas so members closest to the load are stiffer, others lighter if possible. Connect all nodes: (1-3-4-1), (2-3-4-2), (1-2), achieving closure and full connectivity.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Let new node_4 be at (2, 1.5). Compute lengths: node_1-node_3 (2.0), node_3-node_2 (4.0), node_1-node_4 (sqrt(2^2 + 1.5^2)=2.50), node_2-node_4 (sqrt(4^2 + 1.5^2)=4.27), node_3-node_4 (1.5). Members: (1,3), (3,2), (2,4), (4,3), (4,1), (1,2). Estimate internal forces from statics for load sharing. Start with area_id=\'1\' (0.195) for less loaded members, use area_id=\'2\' (0.782) or bigger for members near the applied load. Sum mass = sum(length * area). Evaluate stress under load: since node_3 receives -10√2 ≈ -14.14 (both axes), the diagonal members at node_3 (3-4, 3-1, 3-2) will act in tension/compression per classic truss analysis.",\n\n    "calculation": "Lengths: (1-3):2.0, (3-2):4.0, (3-4):1.5, (4-1):2.5, (4-2):4.27, (1-2):6.0.

Approximate member force in (3-4) ~ 10/sin(theta), theta=atan2(1.5,0)=90°, so force~10. Other adjacent members share less. Stress=force/area; picking area_id=\'2\' (0.782), max stress~10/0.782=12.79<30; for others using area 0.195, max force~5, stress~25.6, still safe.
