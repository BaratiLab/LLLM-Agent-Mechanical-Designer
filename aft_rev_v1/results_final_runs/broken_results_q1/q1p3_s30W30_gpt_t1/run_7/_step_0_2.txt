All solution steps are provided in a single shot.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "There are three given nodes in a mostly horizontal arrangement. Node_1 is pinned at (0,0), node_2 is roller at (6,0), and node_3 is at (2,0), where a concentrated load acts (-10 kN, -45°). The structure must be closed/connected. Available cross-sectional areas are discrete. The design must be statically determinate and triangulated for maximal stability and stress minimization under this load. Additional nodes are permissible for closure/triangulation.",\n\n    "analysis": "With only three collinear nodes, a direct triangle isn’t possible (the three points are on a line), so introducing a new node off the axis is needed for closure and stability. Placing a new node above (or below) the line will enable a load path and necessary triangulation. The main challenge is to transmit the angled load at node_3 efficiently to the supports via triangles, balancing member forces and maintaining low mass. The largest force will be in members connected to node_3; using a compact, nearly equilateral triangle with a fourth node at (2,1.8) or (2,2.0) above the x-axis keeps member lengths short and stress low. Chosen areas will correspond to the minimum necessary to keep member stresses below 30, while keeping total mass under 30 units.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key pattern: With a 45° downward load at node_3, the optimal structure is a single triangle above the base, giving two short diagonals and a vertical to take vertical and horizontal reactions. No duplicate connections allowed. All members must connect unique nodes. The truss must be as compact as possible to minimize weight and force in members, and we should directly connect node_3 to the new node and both supports. Load path is: node_3 → upper node → node_1 & node_2, plus bottom members closing the structure.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Positioning the new node directly above node_3 (e.g., at (2,1.8)) allows for (1) short diagonals, reducing member force and mass; (2) symmetrical member layout for even force distribution; (3) closure via base members between supports and loaded node. This ensures triangulation and statical determinacy. Areas selected for each member are chosen by force: the two diagonals from the new top node will see the largest compression/tension, so pick the minimum area so max |σ| ≤ 30. The vertical and base lengths can use smaller sections if forces allow. All member choices validated by stress calculations.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All members are pin-jointed. The new node at (2,1.8) splits the triangle evenly. Member lengths: base (node_1 to node_2): 6m, base-to-load (node_1-node_3: 2m, node_2-node_3: 4m), diagonals to top: sqrt((2-0)^2 + (1.8-0)^2) ≈ 2.72m, sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-1.8)^2) ≈ 4.38m, node_3-top vertical: 1.8m. For mass, sum (length×area). For forces, solve for reactions (pinned and roller), use method of joints for equilibrium at node_3, propagate along members, calculate force in each based on geometry, pick area for each member so σ=F/area ≤ 30, and keep total mass ≤ 30. Iterate to avoid overdesign. Assign minimal section to each member per load, choosing the lowest valid area_id.",\n\n    "calculation": "Load at node_3 is 10kN at -45°, thus Fx=Fy=-10/√2 ≈ -7.07kN. Node_1 (pinned) takes both reactions, node_2 (roller) vertical only. At equilibrium, vertical reactions sum to 7.07kN down: node_1_y+node_2_y = 7.07kN. By symmetry, node_2_y ≈ 2/6*7.07 ≈ 2.36kN (approximate), node_1_y ≈ 4.71kN. At node_3, resolving forces through the top node at (2,1.8): two diagonals carry bulk of the load, approximate force in diagonal as Fd = load/(2×cosθ), θ = arctan(1.8/2) ≈ 42° ⇒ cosθ ≈ 0.743, so Fd ≈ 7.07/(2×0.743) ≈ 4.76kN per diagonal. Stress in diagonals: min area = Fd/σ = 4.76/30 ≈ 0.159, choose area_id \'1\' (0.195). Short vertical (top to node_3): only shares vertical load, Fy/2 ≈ 3.53kN, stress = 3.53/0.117 (area_id \'0\') ≈ 30, just at the limit. Use area_id \'1\' to be conservative. Horizontal (node_1 to node_2): base member, negligible direct force, use area_id \'0\' (1). Total member masses: base 6m×1=6, node_1-top: 2.72×0.195≈0.53, node_2-top: 4.38×0.195≈0.85, node_3-top vertical: 1.8×0.195≈0.35, node_2-node_3: 4×0.195=0.78, node_1-node_3: 2×0.195=0.39. Total mass ≈ 6+0.53+0.85+0.35+0.78+0.39 ≈ 8.9 (well under the limit). All stresses ≤ 30. Each node is uniquely referenced, no duplicates. Members form a closed structure: node_1→node_2→node_3→top→node_1 and all diagonals.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Design yields a single closed triangle atop base, all nodes part of connected structure. All member area choices ensure max stress ≤ 30, total mass ≈ 8.9 < 30. No duplicate connections, node coordinates are unique, and structure meets all connectivity requirements.
