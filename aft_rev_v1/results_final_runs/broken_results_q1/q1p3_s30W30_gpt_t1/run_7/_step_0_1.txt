Minimize maximum member stress (|σ|≤30), keep total mass ≤30, ensure all three nodes are fully connected (closed) via triangulation, and assign valid cross-sectional areas for each member.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given: node_1 (0,0, pinned), node_2 (6,0, roller), node_3 (2,0, loaded). Triangular connectivity provides the essential closed topology. Must pick optimal area per member under a 10kN force acting at -45° at node_3.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Supports: node_1 is pinned (resists x/y), node_2 is roller (resists y only). node_3 is loaded at -45° with 10kN. Node_3 is between node_1 and node_2 (straight horizontal). Triangular closure: members (1-2), (1-3), (2-3) form a closed loop. Load angle means both x and y force components. Direct (1-3) and (2-3) members act as load-carrying diagonals, with (1-2) as the lower chord.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Main concern: member sizing for max stress under eccentric loading. With no vertical node offset, out-of-plane deformation is a risk, but not a concern for this 2D analysis. Triangulated triangle minimizes out-of-plane buckling. Need all three members for stability and equilibrium. Must assign areas to minimize stress, starting with smallest possible. Members closer to the load will take higher forces.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "With a -45° 10kN load at (2, 0), equilibrium distributes load primarily between (2-3) and (1-3), with (1-2) as tie. Larger cross-section (e.g., area_id \'2\'=0.782 or higher) best at (2-3)/(1-3) for strength. Minimize area on less utilized (1-2) for mass efficiency. Use force balance to select areas that ensure stress ≤30 in each member. All nodes kept as given (as per instructions).",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Forces: Load on node_3: Fx = -10*cos(45°) ≈ -7.07kN, Fy = -7.07kN. Joint equilibrium at node_3; total triangle has members: (1-3), (2-3), (1-2). Run joint method for forces: assign compressive/tensile status, estimate required area for stress ≤30. Lengths: (1-3): sqrt((2-0)^2+(0-0)^2)=2.0, (2-3): 4.0, (1-2):6.0. Mass=area*length sum. Start with area_id \'2\' (0.782) for diagonals, \'1\' (0.195) for chord; adjust as dictated by stress.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member (1-3) and (2-3) orientation is horizontal; horizontal force split equally, so both see similar axial loading. FBD at node_3 solves: opposing diagonal members bear the load, with small force in (1-2). Assume worst case: both diagonals carry nearly all (-7.07kN, -7.07kN) each, vector sum: F=(7.07^2+7.07^2)^0.5=10kN total available axial force, so each diagonal experiences ≤10kN. To keep σ=F/A≤30: A≥10/30=0.333; area_id \'2\'=0.782>0.333 is sufficient. For (1-2): much lower force (support tie), so test \'1\'=0.195. Total mass: (1-3):2x0.782=1.564, (2-3):4x0.782=3.128, (1-2):6x0.195=1.17. Sum=5.862 << 30. All stresses well below 30 (10/0.782=12.8<30).
