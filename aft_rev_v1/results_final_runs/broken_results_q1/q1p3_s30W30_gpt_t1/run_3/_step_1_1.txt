The existing structure has excessive stresses beyond ±30 and needs redesign. The goal is an optimal, closed truss that meets both stress and mass constraints.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Clarify problem: 1) Max |stress| ≤ 30. 2) Mass ≤ 30. 3) All nodes connected. 4) Node/support/load positions fixed. The original design is a simple quadrilateral, but member stresses (up to -57.4) violate constraint 1, even with some large cross-sections. Aim is to optimize stress distribution with triangulation and appropriate cross-section assignments.",\n\n    "analysis": (\n        "The current truss configuration is a distorted quadrilateral (nodes at [0,0], [6,0], [2,0], [3,1.8]), with a diagonal load of 10 units at node_3, applied at -45°. Load at node_3 induces significant compression in member_2 (-57.4) and tension in member_4 (46.99). "\n        "Cross-sectional area assignment can only compensate so much; efficient force path is needed. The lack of internal bracing leads to excessive member stress."\n        " A closed, triangulated truss with a central node below node_3/4 and diagonals can better distribute the load and lower peak stresses."\n    ),\n    "scratch_pad_2": (\n        "The member most out of compliance is member_2 (-57.4).
