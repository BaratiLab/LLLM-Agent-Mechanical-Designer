The objective is to minimize peak stress under load while adhering to stress (±30) and total mass (≤30) constraints, using the most efficient geometry and area selection.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs: pinned (0,0), roller (6,0), loaded (2,0) at -10kN @ -45°. Need all nodes fully connected — triangulated — with minimum peak stress and mass <30. Use only listed area sizes. Additional nodes are allowed for optimal geometry.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The applied load (-10kN at -45°, i.e. (-7.07kN, -7.07kN)) on node_3 will induce significant force. Nodes 1 and 2 are spaced 6m apart, with node_3 between. Direct connections could result in high member forces; triangulation can reduce peak member stress. As the triangle must include all three nodes, and more nodes are allowed, an additional node above node_3 can help form effective load paths and mitigate buckling/overstress.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "A tetrahedral approach may not close with only three nodes; adding a top node (node_4) above node_3 forms two triangular units, distributing the load among more members and lowering force per member.
