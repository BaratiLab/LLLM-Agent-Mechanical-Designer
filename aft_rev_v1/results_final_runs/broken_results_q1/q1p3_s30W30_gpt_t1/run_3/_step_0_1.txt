The structure must resist a single oblique (45-degree) downward load while respecting maximum stress (|σ| <= 30) and total mass (<= 30) constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes: 3 (all on x-axis). Supports: pinned at left, roller at right. Load: -10 at node_3 at 45°. Areas: discrete. Must keep structure closed, minimize stress and mass. Potential for instability with collinear nodes if no new nodes introduced.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The nodes are all collinear on the x-axis. If only these nodes are used, any truss is a mechanism (unstable in out-of-plane/vertical loading). Therefore, to produce a stable, closed truss, we must add at least one non-collinear node. The supports at node_1 (0,0, pinned) and node_2 (6,0, roller) constrain the bottom chord. The load at node_3 (2,0) acts downward-left along 45°, so structure needs to redirect loads efficiently to supports. Triangulation required for stability; a single top node (apex) forming a triangle is efficient.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Need to add an apex above the x-axis for stability and force transfer. Symmetry about the center preferable. Triangulate structure for efficient load path. Check laws of statics to ensure determinacy and proper force paths. Uphill apex height should avoid tall/slender members (buckling risk, mass), but enough height to reduce member forces.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Add a new node_4 above midspan (x ≈ 3.0) to form a triangle. This will ensure stability and closed connectivity. Triangles minimize deformation and best transfer oblique loads out to both supports. Directly connect node_3 to apex for efficient force transfer. Use minimal member lengths and area to reduce mass and stress; optimize apex height to balance compressive/tensile force magnitudes. Select smallest area sections keeping stress within ±30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume node_4 at (3.0, h). h to be chosen for optimal stress/mass tradeoff. Members: (1-2), (2-4), (4-1), (3-4), (3-1), (3-2). Member length and force calculations by geometry. Estimate major load path: node_3\'s force distributes into top/left/right triangles; nodal equilibrium used for force finding. For stress, σ = |F|/A_id. Choose smallest A_id for each member such that |σ| ≤ 30. Compute member lengths for mass estimate: mass = Σ (L × A_id).
