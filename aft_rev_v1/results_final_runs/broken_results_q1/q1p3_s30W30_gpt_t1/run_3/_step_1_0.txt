Node_1 is pinned (left), node_2 is a roller support (right), and a load of (-10, -45) N is applied at node_3. Current design fails (max stress = 57.36 > 30). Objective: redesign truss so that |stress| ≤ 30 in all members and total mass ≤ 30, maintaining a closed, efficient structure.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: |stress| ≤ 30; mass ≤ 30. All nodes must be connected (closed structure). The maximum stress (57.36) is at member_2, likely due to high internal force from an insufficiently triangulated/supported region between node_1 and node_3. The rest of the members carry less, but diagonal/cross bracing is weak or misplaced.",\n\n    "analysis": "The applied load is angled (-10N @ -45° on node_3), so both x and y force transfer are important. With the current layout, node_3 (free node) is only weakly braced. Large compression/tension is pushed into the shortest direct paths. Triangulation is insufficient, especially between nodes 1, 3, and 4, leading to high member stress. Given the support conditions and load, a symmetric, efficiently triangulated Warren or Pratt truss, with perhaps a fifth node to improve redundancy, may reduce individual member forces and stresses. With a total mass far below 30, small increases in area or added members are justified for stress relief.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key patterns: Overstressed member(s) are due to poor load path geometry at node_3. Large forces run through short, shallow-angled members. A \'triangle\' with node_4 above the base, forming diagonals to node_1, node_2, and node_3, is present, but optimal angles and more triangulation could help. Adding one more node above node_4 for better triangulation and distributing the load more evenly could work. Cross bracing between node_4 and the base makes sense.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss by raising node_4 slightly (for better angles), and add a new node_5 above node_4, creating two central triangulated panels. Members will form: base (node_1 to node_2), verticals/diagonals to both center nodes (node_4, node_5), and tie in all loaded and supported nodes. Use minimal areas but upgrade at most-stressed links to area_id \'2\' (0.782), and make all members part of closed triangles.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Load transfer is most effective through triangles. Adding an extra node (node_5), forming two stacked triangles between supported nodes and load, efficiently splits force. This Warren/Pratt-inspired design reduces the angle between load direction and member axes, lowering peak forces and thus stress in members. Some small increase in mass (still < 30) is acceptable for large stress reduction. Avoiding long horizontal or shallow members, stagger member directions for more direct force paths. Select member areas using prior stress information, upsizing where past issues appeared.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Only node_1, node_2, node_3 positions are fixed, node_4 can shift slightly, node_5 can be placed higher for optimal triangles. Areas chosen by prior over-stress. Area = 0.782 (id: \'2\') for high-stress paths, 0.195 (id: \'1\') for less. Mass is length × area (sum). Use trigonometry to set node_4 at (3.0, 2.2) (a bit above previous), node_5 at (3.0, 3.6), so that triangles form among all essential nodes and braces. Estimate member lengths, assign area, and check mass. Stress, assuming roughly equal force distribution (six to eight members), estimate ≤ 20N/member; with area_id \'2\' and length ~4.0, stress = F/A ≲ 25, safe.",\n\n    "calculation": "Node_1 = (0.0, 0.0), node_2 = (6.0, 0.0) (fixed); node_3 = (2.0, 0.0) (load-applied, fixed). node_4 = (3.0, 2.2), node_5 = (3.0, 3.6).
