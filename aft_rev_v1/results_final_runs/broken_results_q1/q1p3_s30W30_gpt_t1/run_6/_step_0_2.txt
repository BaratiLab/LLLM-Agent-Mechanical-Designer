High downward-left (-10kN at -45°) force on node_3; node_1 is pinned, node_2 is a roller. Must minimize maximum member stress (|σ| ≤ 30) and total truss mass (≤ 30 units) using discrete area IDs.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "With 3 nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), and a -10kN load at node_3, classic mechanics suggests a triangular (fully connected) truss. Primary objective: select member areas for safe, low-mass structure. Constraints: all members connected, stresses within ±30, mass ≤ 30.",\n\n    "analysis": "Node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) suffice for equilibrium. Node_3 is offset between but not colinear with the other two. Forming triangle node_1–node_2–node_3 ensures closure. Anticipated: members node_1–node_2 (base, likely in compression from load), node_1–node_3 and node_2–node_3 (diagonals, heavily loaded due to force vector at node_3). Member area sizes should be chosen to keep stresses ≤30 and total mass minimal. Mass = Σ(length × area). Static analysis (method of joints): distribute the load via truss action so that no member overstresses.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "All nodes must be part of a single triangle. The minimal closed geometry (triangle) and all members present. The biggest stress will likely occur in node_1–node_3 (due to force application) and node_2–node_3. Node_3 is only 2m from origin along x, all y=0. Triangle is poorly proportioned—members are close to colinear, so diagonal force paths (node_3 to base) get high stress. Key: assign larger areas to more stressed members, smallest viable to others.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Symmetry does not fully apply, but direct triangulation (node_1–node_2–node_3) is optimal. Prefer to oversize only the most critical members (those meeting at the loaded node). Since all points are on x-axis, members are short except node_1–node_2 (6m). Node_1–node_3 and node_2–node_3 are 2m and 4m.
