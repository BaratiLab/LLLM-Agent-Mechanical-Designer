The goal is to minimize the maximum member stress and total mass, while keeping all stresses within ±30 and mass ≤ 30. We are allowed to generate new nodes for efficiency, but must use the specified set of area IDs.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs include three nodes: node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), node_3 (loaded at -10/-45°). All nodes must be joined in a single closed structure. Structure should be triangulated to efficiently resolve the given diagonally downward force at node_3 and distribute forces back to both supports. Constraints on allowable maximum stress and total truss mass guide area selection.",\n    \n    "analysis": "node_1 at (0,0) is a pinned support, node_2 at (6,0) is a roller, node_3 at (2,0) is midspan and loaded downward/leftward, creating a strong diagonal component in both X and Y. Only three nodes provided span a single open triangle; closed/triangulated trusses require at least three members. With heavy diagonal loading, a direct path from node_3 to both supports is mechanically efficient. However, with only a base triangle (node_1, node_2, node_3), member 1-3 will be under tension (resisting the left) and member 2-3 will take most of the downward/y-component. The base (1-2) will balance horizontal loads. To improve stiffness without excess mass, we consider triangulation. With three nodes only, minimal triangulation is possible; thus, adding a fourth node above node_3 optimally triangulates and allows a more direct force path, reducing peak stresses if it doesn\'t lead to excessive mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The heavy diagonal load is best split so members align with load resolution angles. Adding a new node above node_3 forms two triangles, letting the diagonal load split between a steeper left and less steep right member, reducing stress on any one bar. The optimal y-position is above node_3 but not so high as to sharply increase mass. Setting (2.00, 1.50) as trial position places the new node directly above the load for efficient force transfer without large increases in length. Member areas must be sized so max stress ≤30, while keeping total mass (summed area × length) under 30. Using symmetry and direct load paths will likely minimize both mass and stress.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By adding node_4 at (2.0, 1.5), we create two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4). This will help spread the heavy diagonal load at node_3 efficiently to both supports, reduce force concentrations, and improve structural redundancy. Selecting areas carefully for high-stressed members will keep the mass low by using minimal area members for less stressed links (especially the top and base members), and larger areas only where necessary. Connections: (1-2), (2-3), (3-1), plus (1-4), (4-2), (3-4) to fully close and triangulate.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All bars are two-force members; truss is statically determinate. Young\'s modulus and material density are omitted since only relative mass (length × area) and stress (from force/area) constraints matter. Equilibrium at node_3 (where load applies): load splits into members (3-1), (3-2), and (3-4). By symmetry, base members (1-2), (1-4), (4-2) take less force. Using trigonometry for force directions and basic static equilibrium to estimate internal forces. For area selection: trial with minimum mass, increasing area for most-stressed bars as necessary.",\n    \n    "calculation": """\n    1.

Qualitative force estimation:\n        - Main load from node_3 will go upward via (3-4), splitting to (4-1) and (4-2); triangulation reduces member stresses.\n        - Based on statics, largest forces will be in (3-4), (4-2), (4-1), moderate in (1-3), (2-3).\n\n    5.
