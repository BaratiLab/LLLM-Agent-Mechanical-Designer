The truss must minimize member stress (|stress| ≤ 30), remain closed (all nodes mutually connected), and have total mass ≤ 30 using only cross section areas from a given discrete set.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Three base nodes: node_1 (pinned at (0,0)), node_2 (roller at (6,0)), node_3 (free at (2,0)) with a -10kN load at -45° at node_3. Structure is to be fully closed with lowest feasible member areas and least added nodes. Triangular (three-node) truss is most efficient and statically determinate for three nodes.",\n\n    "analysis": "A triangle connecting all three nodes is the simplest closed structure. node_1 and node_2 form a support span (6m), node_3 is at (2,0). The applied load at node_3 is significant (~7.07kN both x and y). Standard truss with one bottom member (1-2), two diagonals (1-3, 2-3) required for stability. Clockwise: 1-2-3-1. To improve load distribution and allow lower areas, consider adding one new node (\'node_4\') above/below span to better distribute the load and create a more optimal triangle, but must confirm if that gives mass and stress advantages within constraints.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Pure three-node triangle is mass-optimal given discrete areas and no significant out-of-plane geometry, but high load on node_3 (-10kN at -45°) could over-stress members with minimum areas. Adding one well-placed node (e.g., \'node_4\' at apex above support line) may help split forces and enable lower stress with smaller total mass. Must check if this fits under the mass limit.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Triangulate with minimal members; place a new node above base (around (2.5, 1.5)) to add two triangles, enabling more efficient load-paths from node_3 to supports without requiring largest areas. All nodes (old and new) become part of a single closed loop: 1–3–4–2–1. Each member will be assigned the lowest area allowed by the stress constraints, favoring small but not minimum sections where forces dictate. This satisfies full closed connectivity, statically determined, and stress/mass constraints.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": """\n    - Assume 2D statics, ignore self-weight (since total mass is separate constraint), only area and lengths involved.\n    - Key force balance: Load at node_3 = -10 kN at -45°.
