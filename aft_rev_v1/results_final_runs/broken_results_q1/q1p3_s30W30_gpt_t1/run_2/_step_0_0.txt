Constraints: all member stresses ≤ ±30, total mass ≤ 30, and selection from specified cross-section areas. Supports and loaded node positions are fixed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs specify an open, flat 3-node geometry. Load acts at node_3 (middle of base), with pinned (node_1) and roller (node_2) supports. Minimize stress and mass while triangulating the structure. Must add node(s) to close the truss for force path stability.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Node_3 receives a high (-10kN, -45°) load. With both ends supported (node_1 pinned, node_2 roller), the setup risks a mechanism without triangulation. Failure likely in vertical/shear. A new node above base can form a stable triangle, distributing load via direct and diagonal members. Efficient use of cross-sectional areas is imperative as max mass is tight.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Optimal closure is a triangle: add a node_4 above node_3. This forms two triangles. Node_4 position must yield reasonable angles at members for efficient distribution under inclined load and not overly extend length (mass). All members must stay under 30 stress. Cross-sectional areas for high-force members larger, for others minimized.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Place node_4 symmetrically above node_3 to create two triangles (node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_2-node_3-node_4). This carries the inclined load via compression and tension efficiently into the supports. Choose member areas to keep stresses safely below ±30, using minimum required area for low-force members to save mass. Avoid excessive height, balancing between resolving force components and mass. Optimal node_4 y-location calculated by geometry.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume: E=constant, node_4 at (2.0, h). Force components at node_3: Fx=-7.07kN, Fy=-7.07kN. Solve static equilibrium for forces in each member. Use truss joint method or vector statics. Choose minimal area that results in stress ≤30 in highest loaded members, keeping member mass (sum(length*area)) ≤30. Target: node_4 at height where vertical and horizontal tie-ins are efficient (~2–2.5 units, then adjust downward to save mass if stress allows). Member choices: use larger area_id for node_3—node_4 and node_4—supports, smaller elsewhere.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Place node_4 at (2.0, 2.5). Member lengths: node_1-node_3 (2.0), node_2-node_3 (4.0), node_1-node_4 (sqrt(4+6.25)=3.20), node_2-node_4 (sqrt(16+6.25)=4.47), node_3-node_4 (2.5). Force analysis: node_3 acts as a loaded joint with supports on either side. For the main vertical and left/right diagonal members, estimated max truss forces ~10kN (from load; minor amplification from geometry). Chosen area for highly loaded members: area_id \'4\' (3.128). For lightly loaded base members (node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3): area_id \'1\' (0.195). Compute mass: (2.0+4.0)*0.195 + (3.20+4.47+2.5)*3.128 ≈ 1.17 + 30.46 = 31.63. Slightly over. Lower node_4 height to 2.0: node_1-node_4: 2.83, node_2-node_4: 4.47, node_3-node_4: 2.0, diagonal lengths shrink. Recompute: diagonals (2.83+4.47)*3.128=22.89, base members (2.0+4.0)*0.195=1.17, vertical (2.0)*3.128=6.26. Total mass = 1.17 + 22.89 + 6.26 ≈ 30.3. Slightly over; can drop area_id for node_2-node_4 to \'3\' (1.759), recompute mass: (2.83*3.128)+(4.47*1.759)+(2.0*3.128)+(6.0*0.195)=8.86+7.86+6.26+1.17=24.16. Now, all ≤30. Estimate stresses: largest force ~10kN / 1.759 ≈ 5.7, all members well below ±30 -> safe.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "All members now maintain stress <30 and total mass = 24.16 < 30. Node_4 fixed at (2.0, 2.0) by balance of force path efficiency and minimized member length. Chosen areas are lean; member list includes all unique members, fully interconnected and triangulated.
