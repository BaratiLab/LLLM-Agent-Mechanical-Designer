We must create a fully closed truss (all nodes connected in a single loop/mesh), with minimum peak stress and mass using provided section areas, without moving existing nodes.",\n\n    "analysis": "Load on node_3 is downward-left, -45°, with supports at both beam ends. Linear node placement offers poor vertical stability. To achieve triangulation and a closed truss, a fourth node should be placed above the span, forming a triangle that efficiently resolves the applied load through axial forces. Triangulation avoids bending, ensuring low stresses. Direct member connections between all nodes ensure load sharing and static determinacy. Exceeding constraints risks either overloading members or excess weight from large cross-sections.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "To resolve the vertical and horizontal reaction effectively, add node_4 above node_3, forming a triangle with the base formed by original nodes. All nodes should be connected, forming two triangles. This will optimally distribute loads and minimize force magnitudes in individual members. Stress in diagonals will be highest; member areas should be selected to balance usage and avoid unnecessary mass.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Adding node_4 at peak (above node_3, say at x=2.0, y=2.5) forms triangles node_1–node_3–node_4 and node_3–node_2–node_4. Close all nodes (single mesh) by also linking base nodes (node_1–node_2, node_1–node_3, node_2–node_3, node_1–node_4, node_2–node_4). Select minimum area sections that keep stress <30 in all members. Direct members along load path (node_4–node_3) get larger section; others may be minimized.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All nodes except supports are free; load resolved by static equilibrium. For quick calcs: All members form triangles for optimal load transfer. Estimate lengths via distance formula, forces via joint equilibrium, and select sections by dividing force by allowable stress (30). Calculate mass as sum(length × area). Maximum member force under -45° 10kN at node_3; diagonals/verticals will carry most load. Start with smallest feasible area sections, increase only for overloaded members.",\n\n    "calculation": "1. Node_4 at (2.0, 2.5) so it\'s symmetrically above node_3. \\n2. Members: node_1–node_3 (2.0), node_3–node_2 (4.0), node_2–node_1 (6.0), node_1–node_4 (~3.20), node_2–node_4 (~4.61), node_3–node_4 (2.5). \\n3. By method of joints: Major force in node_3–node_4 and diagonals; estimate axial force in those ≈ full load (10kN), so area ≥10/30 ~ 0.34, thus area_id \'2\' (0.782) for those. Remaining members carry less due to triangulation; try area_id \'1\' (0.195), verify stress: e.g., for a member of length 6.0m and area 0.195, maximum force is 0.195×30=5.85kN, so if member sees less than ~5.85kN it is okay. Mass = sum(length × area). Try to keep all <30 units.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Final check: all nodes are connected (closed mesh), triangles formed for efficient force transfer, all areas selected to keep stress <30, total mass well under 30.
