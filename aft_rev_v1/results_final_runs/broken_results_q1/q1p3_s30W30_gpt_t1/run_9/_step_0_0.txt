Design must use specified cross-section areas (area IDs) and limit total mass to ≤ 30.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "With nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), supports at ends, and a load at the middle node, the current setup is a simple, unbraced triangle, easily susceptible to high stress under the applied load. Triangulation is required for closure and reducing peak stresses. Larger areas are heavy, so judicious area selection is needed. The structure must ensure all three nodes are connected in a loop; adding an apex node above the span will allow effective force triangulation, direct load transfer, and reduction of member forces.",\n\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-10 kN at -45°) induces both significant vertical and horizontal reactions. With only three nodes and a triangular connection, the truss would carry very high axial forces in the bottom chord members if unbraced. This could violate both mass and stress limits unless optimized. Therefore, a 4th node above the base (forming two stable triangles) improves load path efficiency, shortens unsupported span, and allows direct reaction path to supports. Area sizing must be set so the highest-stressed members remain < 30 in stress, but mass remains below 30. The load angle suggests vertical and horizontal force components; trigonometric analysis (F*cos(45), F*sin(45)) will guide member sizing.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a \'node_4\' as an apex above node_3 will create two triangles, making a fully connected (closed) truss. The new geometry creates efficient load paths from node_3 through node_4, and then down to the supported nodes (node_1, node_2). Anticipated high forces: from node_3 upwards to the apex, and then from apex to supports. Members from supports directly to the loaded node are also key. Optimal apex height must be calculated to minimize peak force in any member and reduce total mass through balanced member lengths and orientations.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Symmetry, short load paths, and triangulation minimize maximum stress. By raising an apex node vertically above node_3, we ensure the load is transferred efficiently to both supports, distributing forces and reducing the span of the high-force lower chords. Selection of the apex height is a trade-off between member length (affecting mass) and load path angle (affecting force). Assign largest permissible area only to those members expected to see highest force (apex diagonals), selecting smaller area where stress is lower.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume node_3 at (2,0); place apex node_4 at (2,h). Let h be height of 2.5 (a reasonable fraction of the base span for efficiency). Node coordinates become: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (2,2.5). Form members (1-3), (3-2), (1-4), (4-3), (4-2) for closure. Compute load at node_3: F_x = -10*cos(45°) = -7.07, F_y = -10*sin(45°) = -7.07. Analyze force in diagonals (node_3-node_4, node_4-node_1, node_4-node_2) using method of joints. Assign area IDs to balance stresses versus mass, starting with area_id \'4\' (A=3.128) for strongest members and \'1\' (A=0.195) or \'2\' (A=0.782) for lower-stress chords. Compute lengths and sum member masses to ensure total < 30.",\n\n    "calculation": "Members: (1-3): length=2.0, (3-2): length=4.0, (1-4): sqrt(4+6.25)=3.61, (4-3): height=2.5, (4-2): sqrt(16+6.25)=4.12. Anticipate high force in (3-4), (4-1), (4-2). Under load, node_3 receives -10 kN at 45°, resolved to -7.07 kN each x and y. Member (3-4) acts roughly in line with load (-45°), so will see nearly all applied load. Using σ=F/A, A=3.128 yields σ=10/3.128≈3.2 << 30 for maximum. Other members: check if can use lower areas. Conservative assignment: (3-4),(4-1),(4-2): area_id \'4\' (A=3.128); (1-3),(3-2): area_id \'1\' (A=0.195). Mass ≈ (2+4)*0.195 + (3.61+2.5+4.12)*3.128 ≈ 1.17 + 32.95 = 34.12, exceeded. Try area_id \'2\' (A=0.782) for diagonal/apex members and area_id \'1\' (A=0.195) for chords: Mass=(2+4)*0.195 + (3.61+2.5+4.12)*0.782 ≈ 1.17+7.62=8.79, total mass ~9.8. Check stresses: For A=0.782, σ=10/0.782=12.8 ≤ 30. All constraints satisfied.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "A symmetric, closed truss with apex at (2,2.5), area_id \'2\' for diagonals/apex, area_id \'1\' for horizontal chords leads to mass << 30 and max stress ~13 < 30.
