The challenge is to close the structure, minimize stress (max ±30), and remain under 30 mass using cross-sectional area options. The objective is optimal triangulation and direct load pathing, ensuring every node is connected within constraints.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Initial geometry is a straight line along the x-axis; node_3 is between supports. A -45° load on node_3 generates both horizontal and vertical components. To minimize overall stress, triangulation or addition of a fourth node could improve stability, but only if <30 mass is maintained. Symmetry: optimal truss likely triangle-based.",\n\n    "analysis": "node_1 (0,0): pinned support. node_2 (6,0): roller support. node_3 (2,0): force at -45°, F=10. Load resolves to Fx = -10*cos(45)= -7.07, Fy = -7.07. A direct triangle (closed: 1-2-3-1) is the smallest fully closed possible. Diagonal allows load transfer straight from node_3 to supports, minimizing member stress. All three nodes must be connected: three members required: (1-2), (2-3), (3-1). Distribution of forces (via method of joints): members between supports will see horizontal force, diagonal will see combined. High force at diagonal: needs area sizing. Check if additional node is justified (for mass or stress reduction).",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangle (1-2-3-1) is minimal and closed. Adding another node increases mass and likely adds members, risking mass constraint. Three members = three unknowns, tractable via equilibrium. Likely: the diagonal (1-3) will be in high compression/tension. To meet stress constraint, areas on highly loaded members may need up-sizing; less loaded members can have smaller area_id. Must size all within mass=30.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Triangulation is structurally most efficient here. Directly connecting node_3 to both supports ensures good load path and stability. Open structures would be underconstrained. Member (1-3) is likely the most loaded—upsize appropriately. Members (1-2), (2-3) will carry less direct load—smaller areas can be considered after force calculations. Addition of new nodes not justified due to mass limit and node positions. Best symmetry in design is a simple triangle.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions:\\n- All truss members are two-force (axial only), neglecting self-weight.\\n- Static equilibrium at each node.\\n- Select minimal areas per member, upsize if stress>±30.

To get a real triangle and a closed truss, a fourth node above the baseline is justified. Let\'s place node_4 at (2.0, 2.0) directly above node_3 (simplifies geometry and load transfer, offers vertical projection).\\nNow, new triangle: 1-2-4-1, with 3-4 join for optimality. Members: (1-3), (3-2), (1-4), (2-4), (3-4).\\nBut must keep total members minimal for mass. Let\'s triangulate: Connect (1-3), (3-2), (1-4), (2-4), (3-4).\\nCalculate lengths:\\n(3-4): sqrt((2-2)^2 + (2-0)^2) = 2.00\\n(1-4): sqrt((2-0)^2 + (2-0)^2) = 2.83\\n(2-4): sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-2)^2) = sqrt(16+4)=4.47\\nSum all member lengths and assign minimum area first, checking for mass (<30). For critical loaded members ((3-4)), select appropriate area if stress >30.\\nEstimated:\\nAssign area_id \'2\' (0.782) to more loaded member (3-4), area_id \'1\' (0.195) to less loaded. Calculate mass:\\nTotal mass = sum(length × area)\\n= (2.00 × 0.782) + (2.83 × 0.195) + (4.47 × 0.195) + (4.00 × 0.195) + (6.00 × 0.195) = 1.564 + 0.552 + 0.872 + 0.780 + 1.170 = 4.938 < 30.\\nNow, with applied force 10kN split among (3-4) and other support members.
