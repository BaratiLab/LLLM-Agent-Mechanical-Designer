Current structure violates stress and mass constraints: max stress 5.96 (allowed ±20) is acceptable but total mass 40.583 exceeds 30 limit. The goal is to generate a closed truss with minimized stress and mass ≤30, obeying all constraints, keeping supported nodes fixed in position.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Loads: single force at node_3 (-10, -45°). Supports: node_1 pinned (all DOF fixed), node_2 roller (vertical restrained). Existing structure is asymmetric, has six nodes with some long, lightly loaded members but mass is very high. History shows that structures with more nodes/nodal connectivity have reduced stresses but some exceed mass or stress constraints.",\n\n    "analysis": "The current structure has too high mass (40.583) due to large or numerous members; stress max 5.96 <20 is OK so stress is safe range. Load at node_3 downward-left. Supports prevent translation horizontal at node_1 and vertical at node_2. The highly connected structure is flexible but heavy; slender members or alternative triangulated shapes can reduce mass. History suggests that adding nodes at mid-span heights (1.5~3.0 height) and triangulating reduces mass and stress. Over-constrained or very long members cause excess weight. The previous best ranked design uses 8 nodes forming two horizontal levels (y=0 and y=3) joined by triangulation which spreads forces well and limits mass. Symmetry about midpoint would help balance reactions on pinned and roller supports, reduce moment.`,\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Insights: Keeping supports and load positions fixed, a symmetrical truss with a top chord elevated around 3 units and bottom chord along 0 elevation creates a stable closed polygon. The structure should be triangulated for stability and reduced member stresses. Using smaller cross-sectional areas intelligently will reduce mass below 30. Areas around \'1\' (0.195) or \'2\' (0.782) provide low mass sections initially, reserving larger areas for members with largest force demands reduces weight without risking failure.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss with eight nodes in two horizontal layers (bottom at y=0, top at y=3) with bottom chord nodes at 0m, 2m, 4m, and 6m and top chord nodes at 1.5m, 3m, and 4.5m spaced to optimize forces. Add diagonal members to fully triangulate and close the structure. This will distribute loads evenly while minimizing member lengths and increasing stability. Use the area_id levels 1 through 4 carefully by assigning smaller sections to compression members and moderately larger ones to tension as tension capacity is often more critical under eccentric loading. Cross sections from area_id {\'0\':1, \'1\':0.195, \'2\':0.782, \'3\':1.759, \'4\':3.128} are preferred for mass control. The critical design constraint of node fixed positions for load and support is respected.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Locating nodes to form uniform spans with symmetrical vertical sub-divisions reduce eccentric moments. Triangulation prevents large tension or compression in a single member. Force equilibrium equations show that diagonals nearest to supports carry high axial force in tension/compression, requiring careful choice of section size. Longer horizontal top chord members should be sized moderately. Bent-elbows or additions complicated the load path and increased mass. Opting for equilateral or isosceles triangles provides enough stability and load transfer with fewer members and lower stress.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions:\\n- Members are pin-jointed, forces are axial only.\\n- Load at node_3: 10N downward-left (45 degrees), decompose forces!\\n- Supports: Node_1 pinned fix 2 DOF, Node_2 roller fix vertical DOF.\\n- Apply static equilibrium: \\nSum Fx, Sum Fy, Sum M =0 to nodes.\\n\\nCalculate lengths as sqrt((dx)^2+(dy)^2).\\nMass per member ≈ length × area_id cross-section (density normalized to 1).\\nUse areas from provided discrete options to satisfy max stress ≤ 20.\\n\\nThe 8 nodes layout:\\nnode_1: [0.0, 0.0] pinned support\\nnode_2: [6.0, 0.0] roller support\\nnode_3: [2.0, 0.0] load application\\nnode_4: [1.5, 3.0]\\nnode_5: [3.0, 3.0]\\nnode_6: [4.5, 3.0]\\nnode_7: [0.0, 3.0]\\nnode_8: [6.0, 3.0]\\n\\nMembers planned:\\nMembers on bottom chord: 1-3, 3-2\\nMembers on top chord: 7-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-8\\nVertical: 1-7, 2-8\\nDiagonal web members for triangulation connecting adjacent chords and along bottom chords as needed.\\n\\nCalculate member lengths and accordingly select cross sections and check max tensile and compressive forces allocating larger areas to higher forces.
