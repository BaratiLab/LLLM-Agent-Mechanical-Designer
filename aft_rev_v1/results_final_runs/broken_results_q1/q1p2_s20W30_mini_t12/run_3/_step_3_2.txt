Objective is to create a closed 2D truss satisfying max stress ±20 and total mass ≤30, with given supports and loads.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints limit max stress magnitude to 20 and total mass ≤30. Existing nodes include supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Load is an inclined -10 at node_3. Current structure members cause high stress in member_7 (-44.23). History shows alternate nodes and connections reducing stress but mass often exceeds 30. Aim for a symmetric triangulated structure distributing loads evenly to minimize member forces.",\n\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-10 N @ -45 deg) induces both vertical and horizontal components needing support at node_1 and node_2. Current structure cluster around node_3 causes load concentration and high stress on diagonal members joining node_3 to node_5. High mass members between node_4, node_5, and node_2 contribute to heavy total mass. History designs with top nodes near mid-span (x=3-4 range) but page 1 design has mass >30 and stress >20. Simple quadrilateral with internal diagonals spacing load might better distribute force. Nodes at (0,0), (6,0), and 2 nodes above forming a trapezoid or diamond shape to triangulate load paths. Close all loops for stability. Avoid repositioning node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), or node_3 (2,0) since they have loads/supports.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns indicate reducing length and cross-sectional area on high-stress diagonals reduces stress and mass. Increasing top nodes proximity to loaded node redistributes stress paths. Low area members for diagonals work well combined with strong main edges. To keep max stress within ±20, choose fewer members elongated in load direction with moderate cross section. Closed loop of four nodes creating two triangles sustains loads efficiently. All original nodes except node_5 can be reused with slight repositioning of node_4 and node_5 for better triangulation.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign using nodes node_1 (support, 0.00,0.00), node_2 (roller, 6.00,0.00), node_3 (load, 2.00,0.00), add two nodes for triangulation node_4(4.00,2.50), node_5(1.50,2.75) to form four triangular elements interconnected; use lower area IDs for diagonals and moderate for edges to achieve mass and stress limits.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Use two top nodes above main support span forming stable triangular cells sharing load. Triangulated design resists bending and prevents excessive axial forces. Pin at node_1 and roller at node_2 create statically determinate system. Loads at node_3 transmitted via diagonals to supports and top chord avoids excess compression/stress. Sizing members with area_id \'3\' (1.759) for chords and \'1\' (0.195) or \'2\' (0.782) for diagonals balances mass and strength. Node_4 and node_5 placed asymmetric to shift force paths away from node_3 to avoid stress concentration.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumed linear elasticity and axial loading induced stresses.

Distribute axial load among members with symmetric approach. Check each member stress ≤±20. Adjust area down if overstrength to reduce mass.
