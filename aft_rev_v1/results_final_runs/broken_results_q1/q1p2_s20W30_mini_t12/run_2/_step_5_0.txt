Objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss with nodes under given loads/supports that meets both stress and mass limits.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Loads: Single force (-10 N at 45° downward-left) on node_3; supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current nodes span 6 m baseline with two 3.5 m height nodes. Members extensively connected but large mass and stressed member_5 (-2.0163 stress) exceed constraints.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load path is from node_3, transmitting through adjacent members to supports on node_1 (fixed) and node_2 (roller). Current node_3 is low and overloaded, possibly due to long chord members with heavy cross sections causing high mass. Members like member_5 are overstressed, potentially compressive failure or instability. Generation history shows attempts with fewer nodes or simplified geometry lead to large stresses, or lightweight design but poor stress behavior. Symmetric double-triangle shapes with cross diagonal (member_8) provide closure. Existing members with areas 3,4,5 and maximal allowed cross sections increase mass drastically.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Clearly, the original design has heavy members along baseline and verticals with large cross-section to bear negative stress but mass is large. Reducing member count while keeping triangulated closure, and relocation of middle nodes closer vertically while keeping horizontal node_3 fixed under load may reduce member length and mass. Use smaller cross-sections augmented by geometric enhancement (triangulation closer to loaded node).",\n  \n  "proposal": "Redesign the truss as a double triangular (two big triangles side by side) truss replacing node_3 and node_5 mid-lower nodes with a single central node maintaining symmetry. Node_4 and node_6 remain top nodes for height to form strong diagonal triangulation. Use reduced member cross sections to satisfy mass limit 30, while ensuring full triangulated closed structure for stability.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangulated stable geometry ensures load flows efficiently. Node_3 centered between supports on baseline, with top nodes elevated to around 3.0 m forms two triangles. Use smaller area ID members (1 or 2) where possible. Closed loop formed by chord members and top diagonals. Keep node_3 fixed to respect load/support. Node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) unchanged for boundary conditions and horizontal reaction.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": " - Calculate member lengths: horizontal baseline members ~3m each side, vertical height ~3m, diagonals ~3.6m approx.\\n - Calculate member mass as length * area_id\\n - Estimate forces assuming linear elastic, max force based on load distribution from node_3 downwards\\n - Ensure max stress ≤ 20 by selecting an area large enough for calculated force.\\n - Sum masses of all members ≤ 30.\\n - Cross-check that all nodes are connected with at least 2 members (closure).\\n - Use cross-sectional areas area_id values 1.759 (id 3) or smaller to minimize mass but not support heavy stress.\\n - No movement of nodes with loads or supports per instructions (node_1, node_2, node_3).",\n  \n  "calculation": "Baseline node spacing: 0 to 6 m.\\nPlace node_3 at midpoint x=3.0, y=0 as original mid point changed for symmetric load flow.\\nTop nodes node_4 at (1.5, 3.0) and node_6 at (4.5, 3.0).\\nMember lengths:\\n- node_1-node_3: 3 m\\n- node_3-node_2: 3 m\\n- node_1-node_4: ~3.354\\n- node_4-node_6: 3 m\\n- node_6-node_2: ~3.354\\n- node_4-node_3: ~3.354\\n- node_6-node_3: ~3.354\\nEstimate maximum force at node_3 load is 10N.\\nUse equilibrium approx and distribute amongst members by triangle method, maximum axial force ~10-12N.\\nSelect area to keep max stress < 20.
