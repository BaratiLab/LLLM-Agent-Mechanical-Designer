Objective: minimize stress within ±20 and total mass ≤ 30.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes: node_1(0,0, pinned), node_2(6,0, roller), node_3(2,0, load: -10 at -45deg). Initial structure is linear (colinear nodes node_1, node_3, node_2 along x-axis). Without vertical connectivity, structure is unstable in vertical direction under load.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The applied load at node_3 has horizontal and vertical components (~ -7.07 in x, -7.07 in y). Node_1 pinned - fixed in x,y, node_2 roller - fixed in y, free in x. The structure must resist vertical load and lateral displacement. Colinear nodes create an unstable mechanism. To create a stable, closed truss (triangulated), a node above node_3 is necessary to form a triangle and transfer the vertical component. Adding a new node upward near node_3 provides a triangular configuration distributing load paths effectively. Stress calculation depends on member axial forces; using larger area for longer/more stressed members reduces stress. Total length × area must be ≤ 30 mass units.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Current three nodes cannot form a closed, stable triangular framework. Adding one node above node_3 allows a triangle formation. Members will be: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2 (base), and members connecting to the new node to form triangle and resist vertical forces. High cross-sectional area needed for primary load path members to keep stress ≤ 20, but total mass must be controlled.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Add one node exactly above node_3 at y>0 for a strong triangle. This avoids large horizontal extension or moving supports which is prohibited. Define node_4 at (2.00, 3.00) (3 units above node_3), consistent with load vertical component. Connect members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4, and original base members node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2. Choose cross-section areas increasing on longer/higher-stress members. Triangulated design ensures load path stability, reduced bending, and lower axial stress. Calculate individual member forces using static equilibrium and choose area_id accordingly.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Members: m1: node_1-node_3, m2: node_3-node_2, m3: node_1-node_4, m4: node_4-node_2, m5: node_3-node_4.\\nLengths: l_m1=2, l_m2=4, l_m3 ≈ 3.61, l_m4 ≈ 4.47, l_m5=3.0\\nNeed to balance vertical and horizontal forces: resolve node_3 and node_4 equilibrium to find member forces.\\nUse sin/cos for member angles.\\nCalculate forces, choose area_id from given set (e.g., areas: 3.128 to 7.037) for stressed members.\\nMass = sum length * area ≤ 30.\\nStress = Force / Area ≤ 20.,\n  \n  \\"calculation\\": \\"Loading of 10N at -45deg: Fx = -7.07 N, Fy = -7.07 N at node_3.\\nAssuming pinned and roller supports, no movement at node_1 and vertical at node_2.\\nEquilibrium at node_3 and node_4 includes member forces in truss lines.\\nBalance vertical: Loads at node_3 must be transferred by member forces m1, m5, m2.\\nForce in m5 (node_3-node_4) counters vertical load partly.\\nDimensions and assumptions yield: m1 and m2 in tension/compression ~ 6–8 N, m5 tension ~9 N, m3 and m4 less loaded.\\nArea choices:\\nm5 (high load): area_id \'6\' (7.037), m1,m2 moderate load areas \'4\' (3.128), m3,m4 light load so \'1\' (0.195).\\nMass = sum(length * area):\\n2*3.128 + 4*3.128 + 3.61*0.195 + 4.47*0.195 + 3*7.037 ≈ 6.256 + 12.512 + 0.704 + 0.872 + 21.111 = 41.455 mass >30 exceeds limit.\\nLower load member areas to minimize mass:\\nm5 area_id \'5\' (4.887), m1,m2 area_id \'3\' (1.759), m3,m4 area_id \'1\' (0.195):\\nmass= 2*1.759 +4*1.759 +3.61*0.195 +4.47*0.195 +3*4.887=3.518+7.036+0.704+0.872+14.661=26.79<30 good.\\nStress check: force/members/area ≤20, given forces ~9 max, area≥0.195, stress max ~9/0.195=46 >20 too high.
