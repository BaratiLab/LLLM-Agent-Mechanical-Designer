The goal is to minimize maximum member stress (|stress| ≤ 20) and total mass (≤ 30), while ensuring a closed, triangulated configuration. Only the provided cross-sectional area IDs are allowed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three nodes in a nearly colinear layout, with a significant load at node_3. A closed, triangulated truss is required. The structure must be light yet strong enough to keep all member stresses within ±20. The cross-sectional area must be chosen from the area_id set, and total mass must not exceed 30.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Node_3 is between node_1 and node_2, but offset toward node_1. The load on node_3 is -10 kN at -45°, meaning both significant horizontal and vertical components. With only three nodes, the only possible closed truss is a triangle connecting all three nodes. The supports (pinned at node_1, roller at node_2) provide stability. The load path will be from node_3 to both supports. The critical members will likely be those connecting node_3 to the supports, as they directly resist the applied load. Member sizing must balance stress and mass. The triangle will be stable and statically determinate.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "With only three nodes, the only possible closed truss is the triangle. Triangulation is inherently optimal for stability. The most efficient load path is direct connections from the loaded node to both supports, plus the base member. The challenge is to select area IDs for each member such that all stresses are within ±20, and mass is minimized. The geometry is simple, so calculations can be explicit.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Form a triangle: connect node_1-node_2, node_2-node_3, and node_3-node_1. This provides a closed, triangulated structure. The load at node_3 will be resisted by the two members meeting there. Member forces can be calculated via the method of joints. Choose the minimum area ID for each member that keeps the stress under ±20. Use the smallest area where possible to minimize mass, but increase as needed for the most highly stressed members.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume all members use steel-like material (E not needed as only stress is checked). Compute member lengths: node_1-node_2: 6.0 m, node_1-node_3: 2.0 m, node_2-node_3: 4.0 m. Decompose the load at node_3: Fx = -10*cos(45°) ≈ -7.07 kN, Fy = -7.07 kN. Use method of joints at node_3 to solve for member forces. Check stress = |force| / area. Select area_id for each member to keep |stress| ≤ 20. Compute mass = Σ(length × area). Iterate area selection if mass > 30.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: L_12 = 6.00, L_13 = 2.00, L_23 = 4.00. At node_3, let F_13 be force in member node_1-node_3, F_23 in node_2-node_3. Angles: node_1-node_3 is horizontal (0°), node_2-node_3 is at θ = atan2(0-0,6-2) = 0°, but since all y=0, node_2-node_3 is horizontal. But node_3 is at (2,0), so member_13: horizontal left, member_23: horizontal right. Actually, all nodes are colinear, so triangle is degenerate. To avoid a degenerate triangle, introduce a new node above the base: node_4 at (3.0, 2.0) (midspan, raised). Now, triangle: node_1, node_2, node_4, and connect node_3 to node_4. Members: node_1-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4. Now, node_3 is braced vertically, so load can be resisted efficiently. Compute new member lengths: node_1-node_4: sqrt((3-0)^2 + (2-0)^2) = 3.61, node_2-node_4: sqrt((6-3)^2 + (0-2)^2) = 3.61, node_3-node_4: sqrt((3-2)^2 + (2-0)^2) = 2.24. Now, method of joints at node_3: only one member (node_3-node_4), so it must carry the entire load at node_3. F_34 = sqrt(7.07^2 + 7.07^2) = 10 kN. Select area: stress = 10/area ≤ 20 ⇒ area ≥ 0.5. Use area_id \'2\' (0.782). For node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4: assume similar forces (by symmetry, each will take about half the reaction). Assume max force = 7 kN, area = 0.35, use area_id \'2\' (0.782). For base member node_1-node_2, likely low force, but for safety, use area_id \'1\' (0.195). Compute mass: (6.00×0.195)+(3.61×0.782)+(3.61×0.782)+(2.24×0.782)=1.17+2.83+2.83+1.75=8.58 < 30.
