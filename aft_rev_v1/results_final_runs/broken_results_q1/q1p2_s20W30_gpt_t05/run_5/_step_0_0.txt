The goal is to minimize member stress while ensuring all nodes are connected in a closed truss, with total member mass ≤ 30 and all member stresses within ±20. Cross-sectional areas must be chosen from a discrete set. New nodes may be added for optimal triangulation and stress distribution.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes form a nearly collinear base with a load at the intermediate node. To minimize stress and mass, triangulation is necessary. All nodes must be included in a closed structure. The supports (pinned at node_1, roller at node_2) require a stable, determinate truss. Additional node(s) above the base improve force paths and allow for triangulation.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Node_3 (2,0) receives a -10kN force at -45°, which has both x and y components. The pinned and roller supports provide vertical and horizontal restraint. A simple triangle is the minimum closed structure; however, the current nodes are nearly collinear, so adding a node above the base is essential. This new node will allow for two triangles, spreading the load and reducing peak member stress. The load path will be distributed from node_3 upward to the new node, then down to the supports.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a node above node_3 at (2,2.5) creates two strong triangles. This height balances vertical and horizontal force resolution while keeping member lengths reasonable for mass constraint. All nodes are connected, and no duplicate connections exist. The area selection will be based on estimated member forces and stress limits. Triangulation ensures stability and efficient force transfer.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation is critical for stability and low stress. Placing a new node (\'node_4\') above node_3 at (2.0, 2.5) creates two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4). Members from node_1 and node_2 to node_4 provide direct load paths to supports. Connecting node_1 to node_2 forms the base, and connecting node_4 to node_3 and both supports closes the structure. Area selection prioritizes the lowest area that keeps stress within ±20.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All members are pin-jointed. Self-weight neglected (since mass is calculated directly). Load at node_3: Fx = -10*cos(45°) ≈ -7.07, Fy = -7.07. Member lengths: node_1-node_3: 2.0, node_2-node_3: 4.0, node_1-node_2: 6.0, node_3-node_4: 2.5, node_1-node_4: sqrt((2-0)^2 + (2.5-0)^2)=3.20, node_2-node_4: sqrt((6-2)^2 + (2.5-0)^2)=4.72. Set up equilibrium equations to estimate max member force (assume worst-case: load splits equally between triangles), then select area_id so |force/area| ≤ 20. Calculate total mass as sum of (length × area).",\n    \n    "calculation": "Estimate maximum member force: The vertical and horizontal components of the load at node_3 are each -7.07. The geometry suggests forces in members node_3-node_4 and node_3-node_1 (and node_3-node_2) are similar in magnitude. For a conservative estimate, assume max force in any member is ~10. To stay within stress limit, area ≥ 10/20 = 0.5. The closest larger area is 0.782 (area_id \'2\').
