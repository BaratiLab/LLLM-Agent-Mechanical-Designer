The goal is to generate a closed 2D truss with supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller), load at node_3, minimizing max stress and mass within constraints.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "The load is a -10N force at 45° downward left on node_3. Supports fix node_1 fully and node_2 vertically. Current node layout has 6 nodes with complex members but high stress and mass. History shows simpler trapezoidal or triangular trusses with less mass but stress violations. Constraints are max stress ±20 and total mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The current structure has a mid-span load on node_3 on the bottom chord, causing high compressive stress (-26.6) in members near node_6 and node_5. Mass is high due to many members with large cross sections. History shows that simpler trapezoidal trusses with triangulation reduce stress but increase mass. The load path requires a stable triangular or trapezoidal frame transferring load to pinned and roller supports. The current design’s inner node_6 adds complexity but does not reduce stress effectively. The structure must avoid long slender members under high compression, which cause buckling and stress concentration. A symmetric trapezoidal truss with top chord nodes aligned with supports, and bottom chord with load node, triangulated by diagonal members, is promising. Using moderate cross sectional areas (area_id 2 or 3) balances mass and strength.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns show that adding mid-span nodes and triangulation improves load distribution but can increase mass. The best historic structure (constraint_not_met_1) has a trapezoidal shape with 5 nodes and 7 members, max stress ~9 and mass ~47. To reduce mass, fewer members and smaller areas are needed, but must keep stress <20. Using a 5-node trapezoidal closed truss with proper triangulation, and moderate area sizes can meet constraints. Avoid node_6 in center to reduce complexity and mass.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Redesign structure as a 5-node trapezoidal closed truss: nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (0,3), (6,3), and (3,1.5). Supports at node_1 (0,0) pinned, node_2 (6,0) roller, load at node_3 (3,0). Members connect bottom chord, top chord, verticals, and diagonals forming triangles for stability. Use cross sections from area_id \'2\' (0.782) and \'3\' (1.759) to keep mass low and stress within limits. This design is symmetric, triangulated, and closed, expected to have max stress <20 and mass <30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "The trapezoidal shape with a mid-span bottom node carrying the load ensures direct load transfer to supports. Triangulation with diagonals from bottom mid node to top chord nodes avoids bending and reduces stress. The pinned and roller supports allow horizontal and vertical equilibrium. Using moderate cross sections balances strength and mass. Node positions are chosen to maintain symmetry and optimize load paths. This reduces compressive stresses and avoids buckling. The design is closed with interconnected members ensuring stability.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic behavior, static equilibrium, uniform material properties. Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance. Member forces estimated by resolving vertical and horizontal equilibrium at nodes. Stress = Force / Area. Mass = sum(member length × area density).

Members: bottom chord (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2), top chord (node_4-node_5), verticals (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_5), diagonals (node_3-node_4, node_3-node_5).",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(3,0), node_4(0,3), node_5(6,3).

Assign areas: bottom chord area_id \'3\' (1.759), top chord \'2\' (0.782), verticals \'2\' (0.782), diagonals \'3\' (1.759). Estimate forces by static equilibrium: load -10N at node_3 downward left 45°, resolve into components Fx=-7.07N, Fy=-7.07N. Forces distribute symmetrically in diagonals and verticals. Estimated max member force ~14N, stress = force/area. With chosen areas stress <20.
