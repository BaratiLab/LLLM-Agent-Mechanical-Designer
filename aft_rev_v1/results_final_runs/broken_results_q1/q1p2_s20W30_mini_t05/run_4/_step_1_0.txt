Objective is to minimize max stress while keeping mass <30 and stress within ±20, maintaining closed topology.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given load at node_3 downward-left, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller), current members form a closed quadrilateral with diagonal. Max stress is on member_1 (compressive). Areas range 2-3 used mostly. Need to reduce peak stress and possibly redistribute load.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-10N at -45°) induces tension/compression in members connected to it. Member_1 has highest compressive stress (-13.06), likely due to load transfer to pinned support at node_1. Members 3,4,5 carry less stress. Current design uses a diagonal (member_4) to triangulate, which is good for stability. Mass is moderate (25.1), well below 30. History shows no better design found yet. No constraints violated. Potential inefficiency: node_3 is at (2,0) between supports at (0,0) and (6,0), creating uneven load path. Possibly moving node_3 upward slightly and adjusting member cross-sections can reduce peak stress. Also, member_2 and member_4 have similar stress (-4), member_5 low tension (2.23), so areas can be adjusted.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Current design is stable and meets constraints but max stress is relatively high. Load path concentrates stress in member_1. Slight repositioning of node_3 upward can reduce lever arm and compressive load. Adjusting member areas: reduce area of low-stress members to save mass, increase area of high-stress members to reduce stress. Avoid exceeding mass limit. Maintain closed quadrilateral with diagonal for triangulation.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Optimize current design by moving node_3 vertically up from y=0.0 to y=0.8 (keeping x=2.0 fixed due to load), adjust member areas: increase area of member_1 to area_id \'3\' (1.759), reduce member_2 and member_4 to area_id \'1\' (0.195), keep member_3 and member_5 moderate at area_id \'2\' (0.782). This should reduce max compressive stress in member_1 and redistribute forces more evenly while keeping mass under 30.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Raising node_3 reduces bending moment at pinned support by shortening vertical lever arm of load. Smaller cross-section on lightly stressed members saves mass. Larger cross-section on critical compressive member reduces stress. Triangulation maintained by diagonal member_4. Supports fixed, load position fixed. Node_4 remains at (2.0,3.0) to maintain geometry.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic, axial forces only. Calculate member lengths with updated node_3: member_1 length = sqrt((2-0)^2 + (0.8-0)^2) = 2.15m, member_2 length = sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-0.8)^2) = 4.08m, member_3 length = sqrt((2-0)^2 + (3-0)^2) = 3.61m, member_4 length = sqrt((2-2)^2 + (3-0.8)^2) = 2.2m, member_5 length = sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-3)^2) = 5.0m. Calculate mass = sum(length * area). Use areas from area_id. Calculate stresses by force equilibrium and member area. Check max stress ≤ 20 and total mass ≤ 30.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: m1=2.15, m2=4.08, m3=3.61, m4=2.2, m5=5.0. Areas: m1=1.759, m2=0.195, m3=0.782, m4=0.195, m5=0.782. Mass = (2.15*1.759)+(4.08*0.195)+(3.61*0.782)+(2.2*0.195)+(5.0*0.782) = 3.78 + 0.80 + 2.82 + 0.43 + 3.91 = 11.74 < 30, good margin. With increased area on member_1, stress reduces proportionally by area increase factor (previous area approx 0.782 to 1.759 ~2.25x area), so max stress on member_1 reduces from 13.06 to approx 5.8. Other members with reduced areas increase stress but remain well below 20. Overall max stress reduced, mass reduced significantly.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Design satisfies constraints: max stress ~5.8 < 20, mass 11.74 < 30. Load path improved by node_3 elevation.
