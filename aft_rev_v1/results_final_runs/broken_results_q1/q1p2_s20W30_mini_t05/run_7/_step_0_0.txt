Objective is to minimize stress under ±20 limit and total mass ≤30, ensuring full connectivity and structural stability.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes at (0,0), (6,0), and (2,0) are colinear initially, with a load at node_3 (2,0) at -10N, 45° down-left. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Need to create a closed structure (triangle or polygon) to resist load and minimize stress.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The three given nodes are colinear on x-axis, which cannot form a closed truss by themselves. To form a stable, closed truss, a new node above the line is necessary to create a triangular frame. Load at node_3 is diagonal downward-left, inducing tension and compression in members. Pinned and roller supports provide boundary constraints preventing rigid body movement. Triangulation is key for stability and minimal stress. Members must be sized to keep stresses ≤20 and total mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding one node above the line near the load node will create a triangle and distribute forces efficiently. The triangle will have members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4, and existing node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2. This ensures closed connectivity. Area selection must balance mass and stress capacity.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) above node_3 to form a triangle with nodes 1, 2, and 4. Connect node_4 to node_1, node_2, and node_3. This creates multiple load paths. Use larger areas for longer or highly stressed members, smaller areas for shorter or less stressed.
