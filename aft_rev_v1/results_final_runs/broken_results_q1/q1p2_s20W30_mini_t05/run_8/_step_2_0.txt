The objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss with given supports and load, reducing mass and stress within limits.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given: load at node_3 (-10N at -45°), supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current nodes span wide horizontally with vertical offsets at nodes 4 and 5. Current max stress 15.45 < 20 but mass 47.94 > 30 violates mass constraint. History shows high stress and mass in previous designs.",\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 downward-left induces tension and compression in members connecting node_3 to supports and adjacent nodes. Current design has redundant members and large cross sections causing high mass. Member_8 is highly stressed (-15.45), indicating load path concentration. The structure is asymmetric about the load node. The supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) fix horizontal and vertical reactions appropriately. Current node_3 is on the baseline causing high stress in short members. Triangulation exists but could be improved. History shows simpler triangular trusses have high stress, complex pentagonal truss has high mass.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Insight: To reduce mass, minimize member lengths and cross-sectional areas while maintaining load paths. To reduce stress, improve triangulation and distribute load better. Node_3 should be raised above baseline to reduce bending and stress concentration. Symmetry about vertical line through node_3 can help balance forces. Use fewer but strategically placed members with moderate cross sections. Avoid very small or very large cross sections to balance mass and stress.",\n    "proposal": "Redesign a symmetric closed truss with 5 nodes: supports at node_1(0,0) pinned and node_2(6,0) roller fixed. Raise node_3 to (3.0,1.5) (load node), and place nodes 4 and 5 at (1.5,3.0) and (4.5,3.0) to form a trapezoidal shape with top chord. Connect members to form two triangles on each side of node_3, ensuring full triangulation and closed structure. Choose moderate cross sections from area_id 2 or 3 to balance stress and mass. This layout reduces member length and distributes load better, lowering stress and mass.",\n    "reasoning": "Symmetry about vertical axis through node_3 ensures balanced load distribution. Raising node_3 above baseline reduces compression in bottom chord and tension in top chord, lowering max stress. Triangular substructures provide rigidity and reduce bending. Using moderate cross sections (area_id \'2\' = 0.782 or \'3\' = 1.759) balances member strength and mass. Members connecting load node to supports and top nodes carry main loads, bottom chord stabilizes. Supports fixed as per input. Node_3 position not changed horizontally to maintain load application point and constraints.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: uniform material density, stress proportional to force/cross-sectional area. Calculate member lengths via Euclidean distance. Mass = sum(length * area). Cross sections assigned to keep max stress ≤20 and total mass ≤30. Force equilibrium at nodes ensures member force distribution. Calculate member forces using method of joints or sections approximated by truss symmetry and load. Select cross sections accordingly.",\n    "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(3.0,1.5), node_4(1.5,3.0), node_5(4.5,3.0).

Total mass ≈ sum(length*area) ≈ 3.35*1.759*2 + 1.58*0.782*2 + 3*0.195 + 3.35*0.782*2 = 11.78 + 2.47 + 0.585 + 5.24 = 20.08 < 30.
