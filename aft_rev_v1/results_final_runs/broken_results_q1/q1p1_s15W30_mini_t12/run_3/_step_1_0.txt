The objective is to generate an optimal closed 2D truss satisfying max stress ≤ ±15 and mass ≤ 30 by redesigning node positioning and member arrangement, ensuring equilibration and efficient load transfer.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Current design has four nodes with one external downward-left diagonal load (-10 N, 45°) at node_3. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) provide adequate boundary conditions. Existing members are mostly short spans, but member_1 is overstressed due to direct load path and limited triangulation. Mass is adequate but stress violation exists, indicating a need for improved load distribution through geometry and section sizing.",\n\n    "analysis": "The load at node_3 is exerted downward-left causing tension/compression in members connected to node_3 (member_1 and member_5). Member_1 experienced unacceptable compressive stress (-54.39 > -15 limit), indicating insufficient capacity or excessive force concentration. The existing quadrilateral geometry is weak under this asymmetric load. Member areas used are moderate, but most mass concentrates on vertical members 3 and 4, which are lightly stressed. The truss lacks robust triangulation for better force path and stiffness. Prior attempts focused on varying member areas (1,2,3) insufficient to mitigate high stresses. Adding further triangulation and improving aspect ratio could help. Short lengths and better angle resolved forces reduce stress.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Main concern is exceeding max stress at member_1 under load. Secondary issue is optimal use of material to keep structure redundant and closed. Symmetry about vertical axis can be exploited, but load is asymmetric at node_3. Adjust node_3 position vertically upwards and to the left could reduce bending shear on member_1. Adding additional nodes or members to create smaller triangles and reducing long member span segments should help. Area selection must balance mass & stress capacity. Keep pinned and roller support fixed.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss geometry adding a new node between node_1 and node_3 raised slightly upwards for better triangulation and force distribution. Reposition node_3 slightly raised to reduce stress concentration and use diagonal members to enforce triangulation. Retain supports positions. Use a 5-node closed truss to distribute loads symmetrically around load point with carefully selected areas: mostly moderate areas (IDs 2-4) to keep mass under limit and stress under ±15.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Adding an extra node between node_1 and node_3 shifts load distribution path, reduces excessive compression on member_1. Increasing height of node_3 reduces compression. Strong diagonals forming several triangles reduce forces per member, lowering stress. Pinned and roller supports maintain equilibrium; roller at node_2 allows horizontal movement but restrains vertical displacements. This repositioning and member redefinition optimize load path, decrease bending effects, and maintain lightweight structure. Member areas selected according to force demands, ensuring stress limits, using areas around 3.128 (ID \'4\') and 1.759 (ID \'3\').",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: member axial forces calculated by static equilibrium of joints and force vector components; Stress = Force / (Area × Cross-sectional unit constant not given but assumed consistent); Member length from Euclidean distances; total mass=sum of (length × area factor). Steps: 1) Define 5 nodes with coordinates; 2) Define members connecting nodes to form closed structure with triangulation; 3) Calculate lengths and angles; 4) Assume static equilibria to identify approximate forces on each member (neglecting self-weight); 5) Adjust member areas to keep max stress ≤15; 6) Check total mass ≤30; Iteratively finalize.",\n\n    "calculation": "Nodes: node_1 at (0.00, 0.00), node_2 at (6.00, 0.00) fixed; node_3 raised to (2.45, 1.10) to reduce compression; add node_5 between node_1 and node_3 at (1.15, 0.75). Node_4 tall at (3.00, 4.00) retained for upper triangulation.
