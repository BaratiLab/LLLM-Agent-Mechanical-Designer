Objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss satisfying max stress and mass limits while ensuring structural stability under the given loads and supports.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Currently: Four nodes with loads applied at node_3(-10N at -45°), supports pinned node_1 and roller node_2. Existing members form a triangle plus a base segment at node_3 causing high stress mainly in member_1. Constraints: max stress ±15, total mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load on node_3 induces high compressive force (stress -54.39) on member_1 (node_1-node_3). Member_1 length is short (2m approx), small cross section area assigned leading to high stress. The structure is not fully closed as node_3 lies on base line creating a weak load path causing stress concentration. The triangle formed by nodes 1,2,4 is large and members between the base and top node_4 have large length with heavy cross section areas adding most mass. Member_5 (node_3-node_4) offloads some stresses but ineffective for node_3 load due to geometry. The current design uses asymmetric node_3 under load, reducing triangulation efficiency. Triangle is not equilateral nor symmetric resulting in inefficient load transfer.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Key insight: placing node_3 on base divides base into two members but leads to high compressive stress in member_1. Making node_3 part of a triangle with node_4 not effective due to positioning. Improving the topology with a symmetric, closed truss and ensuring all loaded nodes are stabilized via effective triangulation likely improves stress distribution and reduces mass. Member cross-sectional areas need right-sizing to stay below ±15 stress.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Redesign structure with 4 nodes arranged to form a diamond shape with pinned on node_1(0,0), roller on node_2(6,0), and nodes 3 and 4 elevated with symmetrical coordinates. Connect members forming two triangles: Top-left (node_1-node_3-node_4) and top-right (node_2-node_3-node_4). Node_3 under load at (3.0,3.0), positioned symmetrically to distribute load evenly onto pin and roller supports, minimizing peak stresses. Use member cross sections large on high force diagonal members and smaller for less stressed members. This yields a fully closed, statically determinate structure with good triangulation and load distribution.",\n    \n  "reasoning": "A diamond shape provides two fully triangulated substructures, sharing loads at node_3. Placing node_3 at mid-span (horizontal center) on top supports uniform reaction forces at supports. Node_4 elevated helps create stiff diagonals transferring force from node_3 down to the supports. This arrangement avoids tension or compression peak forces bigger than limit ±15MPa. Supports at base nodes restrain vertical and horizontal directions to stabilize structure. Member lengths range from ~3 to ~6 meters allowing mid-range areas to minimize mass. Using areas_ids from small to moderate cross sections further balances stress and mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Member forces are calculated using static equilibrium considering vertical and horizontal force balance on node_3. Lengths computed via Pythagoras. Stress = force/area. Mass calculated as sum of (length × area density × unit density).
