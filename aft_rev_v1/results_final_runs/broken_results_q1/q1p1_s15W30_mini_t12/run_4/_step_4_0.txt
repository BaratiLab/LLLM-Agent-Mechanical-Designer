Objective is redesign a statically efficient, closed 2D truss respecting constraints and supports while avoiding node movement at loaded and supported nodes.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 is downward-left (-10N at -45°). Supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller fix vertical and horizontal displacements appropriately. Existing 4-nodes truss with 6 members with stresses exceeding ±15. Mass marginally within limit. Need stronger chords or redistribution of force paths to reduce peak stress.",\n  \n  "analysis": "From history, largest stresses present in members connected to node_3 (loaded), especially those connecting node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2. Current design’s main horizontal chord (node_1-node_2) carries substantial force, and members to the apex node_4 distribute load unevenly causing high member stresses. The structure is a shallow triangle with node_4 above chord, but the load causes bending and large axial forces in members with small areas (area_id=1 or 2). To reduce max stresses, distributing load via additional triangulation and optimizing cross-section areas is needed. Previous designs with larger apex height and stronger top diagonals reduced stresses but exceed mass limits.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "A closed truss must have all nodes connected. Increasing height of apex node_4 increases compressive member lengths and force resolution, lowering stress. Increasing cross-section in load carrying members and reducing excess mass in less critical members can ensure overall below allowed mass. Current nodes at supports and load must remain fixed. Proposal: Increase apex vertical height modestly for better rigidity, maintain base chord (node_1-node_2), add diagonal member across bottom chord if changed, and assign cross-section areas strategically.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Adopt a 4-node, 7-member closed truss with nodes: node_1 and node_2 fixed at base; node_3 placed on base between them as load application point; and node_4 raised in the vertical direction above node_3 by ~3.4 units to form a good triangular panel shape, improving load path. Members: base chord (node_1-node_2), bottom chord segments (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2), two diagonals forming triangles to the apex node_4 (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4), plus diagonals across the internal triangle (node_3-node_4) and an additional bottom diagonal (node_1-node_3 to node_2) if needed but preferably keep 7-members for closed triangulation.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "This truss keeps stable supports at node_1 and node_2, load fixed at node_3 base. Raising node_4 apex provides better triangulation, improving force distribution, this reduces axial force in base members and distributes force through diagonals. Minimizing member length and using moderate cross-section areas from area_id list keeps mass below 30. Utilizing area_id=3 for high load members and area_id=1 or 2 for lesser load members balances strength and mass. This strategy minimizes max stress, achieves closure of load path.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Static equilibrium, planar 2D joints as frictionless pin. Force magnitude split using truss geometry: vector decomposition via member lengths and angles. Mass computed as sum (length × area). Using triangle area property for force redistribution. Check member axial force <= 15 and mass sum <= 30. Nodes fixed where load/support given, others adjustable as described. Cross-section chosen to allow max axial force without exceeding stress limits.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node positions: node_1 (0.00, 0.00), node_2 (6.00, 0.00) fixed at base.

Membership and lengths computed: base node_1-node_2 length=6, node_1-node_3=2, node_3-node_2=4, node_1-node_4≈4.38, node_2-node_4≈4.17, node_3-node_4≈3.40.
