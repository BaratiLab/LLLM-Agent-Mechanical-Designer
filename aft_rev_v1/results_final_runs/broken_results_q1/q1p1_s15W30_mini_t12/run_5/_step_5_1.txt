Objective: generate a fully connected closed 2D truss with nodes fixed at supports and load, while lowering max member stress ≤±15 and mass ≤30.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Load: -10N at node_3 at -45°, Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 prevent rigid body motion. Current structure is irregular with nodes not fully symmetric and stress out of bounds. Design includes 5 nodes and 7 members with mixed area sizes. Historical designs with fewer nodes generally had large stresses or masses.",\n    "analysis": "Node_3 carries the load pushed diagonally down-left. Load path goes through members from node_3 to supports node_1 and node_2. Members with Area \'1\' were heavily overstressed (e.g., member_1: -65 MPa). Larger areas lower stress but increase mass significantly. Non-symmetric node placements and missing triangulation paths contribute to high stresses. Closed topology with proper triangulation is missing in current design and history with many constraint violations. Eulerian stable closed shapes formed by triangulation reduce bending and improve force distribution.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Symmetry about the horizontal middle axis and triangulated closed forms significantly reduce peak stresses and spread loads. Load at node_3 below the line from node_1 to node_2 suggests a triangular form connecting nodes 1, 2, 3, with additional nodes to form stable quadrilaterals or triangles should help. Larger areas selectively on high force members needed but total mass limit restricts oversizing.",\n    "proposal": "Redesign with triangular and quadrilateral closed chains connecting nodes 1, 2 at base, node 3 centered, and two upper nodes symmetrically placed about node 3. Use area selections sparingly to keep mass <30 and mitigate peak stresses. Leave supports at fixed node positions, position added nodes for load spreading.",\n    "reasoning": "Truss exhibits stable geometry using triangulation. Add node_4 and node_5 above node_3 symmetrically: node_4 left of node_3, node_5 right, forming upper pyramid top. Connect all nodes with minimal members forming triangular and quadrilateral closed paths for stable load distribution, including diagonals. Area values such as \'3\' and \'2\' allow strength-cost balance; use lightweight \'1\' on less stressed members. Use straightforward force flow principles to keep stresses under ±15 MPa. The horizontal line from pinned node_1 to roller node_2 gives base support.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic, mass proportional to length × area. Node_1 at (0,0), node_2 at (6,0) as supports unchanged, load at node_3 at (3,0). Create symmetrical nodes at (2.2,2.0) and (3.8,2.0) for top. Members: base, vertical, diagonals, and top chord connections. Calculate member lengths by Euclidean distance. Use statics equations to check approximate member forces by method of joints or sections. Member stresses: force / area; check max absolute ≤15MPa. Estimate member mass = length × area. Iterate area assignment until total mass ≤30 and max stress ≤15. Use areas: \'3\' = 1.759, \'2\' =0.782, \'1\' =0.195 for balancing stress and mass. Prefer smaller areas on tension members if stress is low.",\n    "calculation": "Node positions: node_1=(0.00,0.00), node_2=(6.00,0.00), node_3=(3.00,0.00) load node.
