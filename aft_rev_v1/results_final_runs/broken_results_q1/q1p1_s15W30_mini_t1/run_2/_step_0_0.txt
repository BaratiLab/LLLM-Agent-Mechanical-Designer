Objective: minimize stresses ≤ ±15 and total mass ≤ 30 using available discrete cross-sectional areas.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes initially collinear along x-axis: node_1 at (0,0), node_3 at (2,0), node_2 at (6,0), with a -10 force at 45° down-left at node_3. Supports fix node_1 (pinned) and allow vertical movement at node_2 (roller). To achieve a closed stable truss, need at least one triangular loop. Current linear setup is unstable to lateral loads and cannot satisfy constraints alone.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 has components Fx = -10*cos45° ≈ -7.07 (left), Fy = -10*sin45° ≈ -7.07 (down). The pinned at node_1 restrains both x and y; roller at node_2 restrains only vertical y. Without any vertical support near node_3, a direct vertical reaction path is missing. The members must form a closed polygon to avoid mechanisms and permit force transfer. The initial nodes are collinear; adding a new node above node_3 creates a triangle for stability and load path. Members along these connections will transfer axial load; areas must be chosen to keep stresses ≤ ±15 and total mass ≤ 30. Failure modes: buckling in compression and tensile failure if stress too high. Load path suggests forces channeled from node_3 upwards and laterally to supports.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding node_4 above node_3 creates a triangular geometry: node_1-node_4-node_3 forms one triangle, node_3-node_4-node_2 another. This splits the lateral and vertical load components. Member lengths and areas must be balanced to limit stress. Triangulation is essential. The vertical height of node_4 directly controls member lengths and resulting stresses. Use symmetric large cross section on high load members, small on low load. Area selection discrete with steps from 0.195 to 19.548, so approximation needed.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 2.5) above node_3 to form a stable isosceles triangle with base on x-axis (node_1 - node_2). Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_2. This closed hexagon is redundant but ensures stability. High axial forces expected along node_3-node_4 and node_4-node_1, so assign moderate-large area to keep stress under limit. Use smallest areas on less stressed members to minimize mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic, axial forces only. Stress = Force / Area. Force determined with static equilibrium at nodes. Member length = Euclidean distance. Mass = sum(length × area). Area "area_id" keyed values from given dict.
