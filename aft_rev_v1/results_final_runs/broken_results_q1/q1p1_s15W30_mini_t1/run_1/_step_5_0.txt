Objective is to generate a closed 2D truss satisfying stress (±15) and mass (<=30) constraints while maintaining supports and load nodes fixed.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "The current truss is a 5-node structure with a downward-left diagonal load at node_3. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) are fixed at base. Max stress violation mostly due to tensile/compressive overload on member_2 and member_3 with relatively small cross-sectional areas. Total mass is under 30 but stress violations force larger cross sections or better load distribution.",\n\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-10 N at -45°) introduces tensile and compressive forces in neighboring members. Support conditions provide horizontal and vertical constraints at node_1 and vertical only at node_2. Existing structure\'s member_2 has very high tensile stress (-27 MPa), suggesting small cross-sectional area with high load path through short member_2 and member_3. The structure is not optimally triangulated - node_5\'s vertical position is close to node_4, causing stress concentration. The history shows best designs with more triangulated upper chords and larger area members on longer spans. Closed truss is needed for load path redundancy and stress reduction. The max stress constraint forces redistributing members and choosing larger sections on critical load paths. Also, increasing node_5 vertical spacing separates force paths, lowering stresses.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "The patterns indicate that adding a low node_5 close to mid-span lowers stability and increases stress. Designs with node_5 placed higher or adding diagonal members distributing load better yield lower max stresses and acceptable mass. Members with area_ids 2-4 perform well in balancing mass and stiffness. Optimizing node_5 height and adding cross bracing diagonals improves performance. Reusing a prior design but fine-tuning node_5 upward and members area sizes can meet constraints.",\n\n    "proposal": "Modify the current 5-node structure by raising node_5 vertically from 2.9m to ~3.5m to increase triangulation and reduce stress on horizontal members. Use cross bracing member from node_5 to node_2 to further close the truss and distribute loads. Adjust cross-sectional areas prioritizing mid-length members to area_id \'3\' (1.759) or \'4\' (3.128) and shorter high-stress members to area_id \'4\' or greater. Keep nodes_1, 2, and 3 fixed as required.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Increasing node_5 height separates load paths, reduces stress concentration, improves triangulation. Adding diagonal from node_5 to node_2 closes truss, spreading tension. Choosing moderate area IDs 3 and 4 reduces mass but controls stresses below ±15. The load at node_3 will be taken mostly by two diagonals node_3–node_5 and node_3–node_4 complemented by node_5–node_2 diagonal. The lower chords support compressive loads by connecting node_1 to node_3 and node_3 to node_2. Symmetric triangulation is key to minimizing bending and stress.\',\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members behave in axial tension/compression only. Stress = Force / Area. Member force estimated via static equilibrium at loaded nodes and support reactions. Mass = sum(member length × area_id).

Balance forces at nodes. Estimate member stresses and verify max ±15 constraint. Iterate area_ids if stress too large or mass >30.
