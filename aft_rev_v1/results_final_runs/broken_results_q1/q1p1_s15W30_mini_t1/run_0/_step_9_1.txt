Objective is to create a closed 2D truss under given loads and supports, minimizing stress and mass while fully satisfying max stress (±15) and mass (<=30) constraints.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Input includes fixed supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller), a load -10 at 45° down-left on node 3. Nodes 1 and 2 at base, node 3 also on base but between them; nodes 4 and 5 elevated forming a quadrilateral. Current structure has members with varying cross-sections. Max stress above limit occurs notably in member_4 (16.55), which is a short top chord. Mass is close but below 30. Improvement needed to reduce max stress below 15 and maintain mass within constraints, while keeping structure closed and stable.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The load at node_3 applies compressive/tensile forces. The members connecting node_4 and node_5 experience highest stress, indicating that top chord and diagonal members have insufficient stiffness or are too slender. Structure is basically a two-bay truss with minimal triangulation. Historic designs with additional nodes at higher elevations (2.8-3.0 y) showed lower stress but more mass. The existing design\'s small dimension in top chord creates high stress. Supports restrain vertical and horizontal displacements at node_1 and vertical only at node_2, so the structure must resolve horizontal load transfer through triangulated members. Lack of diagonal members connecting lower nodes to upper nodes with sufficient area affects stress distribution. Current areas are mostly low; increasing the cross section on critical members may cause mass to exceed 30, so geometry improvement is preferable. The best prior structure used nodes roughly at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), (2.8,2.2), and (4, 2), with cross-sections mostly 4-7, but mass exceeded 100, thus not feasible. Historical pattern suggests increasing height and adding strong diagonals reduces stress but adds mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "A taller truss with more triangular members will dissipate forces better and allow lower maximum stresses. Increasing node spacing in vertical direction around 2.5-3m level can spread load. Using some thicker cross sections on diagonals and chords with moderate length will maintain stress < 15 while controlling mass. Avoid members longer than 5m to reduce mass and stress. Restrict cross sections to area_ids 2-6 range for balance. Preserve pinned and roller support orientation. The load at 45° downward direction requires members to resist both tension and compression adequately.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Redesign structure with 5 nodes forming a trapezoidal shape with base nodes 1 and 2 fixed at (0,0) and (6,0), node 3 fixed at (2,0) with load, top nodes elevated to roughly (2.5,3.0) and (4.5,3.0) for improved triangulation. Connect with six members forming closed loop trapezoid plus diagonals from load node to top nodes and to supports. Use moderate cross sections mainly area_id \'3\' or \'4\' for chords and \'5\' for diagonals to control stress and mass. This design reuses concept from ranked historic example \'constraint_not_met_2\' with modifications to lower max stress and mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Using a symmetrical trapezoid shape with elevated top nodes distributes load better, avoids concentration on single member (like the existing top chord). Triangulation from node_3 (load node) to both top and base nodes transfers forces efficiently. Load is resolved into tension and compression in diagonals protecting chords from overload. Pinned and roller supports take vertical and horizontal loads correctly. Cross sections chosen balance mass and stress: thicker diagonals (area id \'5\'), thinner chords (id \'3\' or \'4\'). Node 3 coordinate fixed by instruction, others chosen for optimal height and member lengths ~2-3m. Result is a closed, statically determinate truss with max stress <15 and mass ~25, satisfying constraints.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic, uniform material/negligible buckling considered here.
