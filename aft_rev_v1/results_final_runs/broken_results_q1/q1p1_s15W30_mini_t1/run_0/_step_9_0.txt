Objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss structure under given loads, supports, and constraints minimizing max stress ≤ ±15 and mass ≤ 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Load is -10N at node_3 at -45°, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Current nodes mostly along bottom chord with two top nodes, asymmetric shaping. Members show stress concentration (member_4 very high). History shows attempts to increase height and triangulation but resulted in higher mass or stress violations.",\n  "analysis": "Load path directs force at node_3 to both supports. Current bottom chord insufficient to redistribute load well. Member_4 (top chord connecting nodes 4-5) is heavily overstressed due to inadequate triangulation and member sizing. Designs with taller top chords or additional nodes (node_6) improved stress but inflated mass. Some structures with better triangulation reduced stress but mass exceeded 30. Bottom chord members with area_id = 3 and above have good stress but limited load transfer. Asymmetry and limited triangulation reduce redundancy and load sharing.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Need fully triangulated, symmetric, closed truss with improved top chord height for better force distribution. Add diagonal members for triangulation to reduce high local stress. Maintain supports and loaded node positioning. Use medium cross sections to keep mass under 30. Avoid overly large top chord length or height that increases weight or stress. Consider repositioning top nodes slightly for symmetry and load transfer.",\n  "proposal": "Redesign truss by placing node_3 between supports on bottom chord as load point. Add two top nodes forming isosceles triangle with base (node_1 to node_2) at 6 length units. Triangulate fully with diagonals from bottom to top nodes and top chord. Use area_id \'4\', \'3\', and \'2\' for top chord and diagonals to keep stress moderate and mass low. Ensure closed truss with 5 nodes and 8 members.",\n  "reasoning": "Symmetry and three-node top chord create uniform load sharing and less bending. Triangulation converts bending into axial forces, reduces stress concentrations. Keeping height moderate (~2.2 units) balances stress and mass. Use higher area_id on highly loaded members (bottom chord) and moderate on diagonals and top chord to stay under max stress and mass constraints. Avoid overly small or large cross sections to prevent stress spikes or mass excess.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members are axially loaded only. Material density uniform, stress proportional to force/cross-section. Force balance: ΣFx=0, ΣFy=0 at nodes. Calculate length = sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2). Mass per member = length × area_id value. Member stress estimated from applied load divided by cross-sectional area times length factor. Choose area_id so max stress < 15. Calculate total mass as sum of all member masses and verify ≤ 30.",\n  "calculation": "Node positions: node_1(0.00,0.00), node_2(6.00,0.00), node_3(3.00,0.00) load node. Two top nodes: node_4(2.00,2.20), node_5(4.00,2.20) form top chord. Members: bottom chord (node_1-node_3-area 7.037), (node_3-node_2-area 7.037), top chord (node_4-node_5-area 3.128), diagonals (node_1-node_4-area 1.759), (node_4-node_3-area 1.759), (node_3-node_5-area 1.759), (node_5-node_2-area 1.759), (node_1-node_5-area 1.759).
