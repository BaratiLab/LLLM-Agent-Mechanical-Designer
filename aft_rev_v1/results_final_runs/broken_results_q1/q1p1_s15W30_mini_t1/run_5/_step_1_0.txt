Objective is to generate an optimal closed 2D truss that meets max stress <= ±15 and mass <= 30, preserving supports and loads, and ensuring full connectivity.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given: Load at node_3 (-10 N at -45°), Supports pinned at node_1 (0,0), roller at node_2 (6,0), Nodes fixed except node_4 located at (2,3). Members formed a partial square with diagonal chords. Max stress in member_4 (node_3 to node_1) is very high in compression (-25.49). Existing mass too high. Need better triangulation and area sizing.",\n\n    "analysis": "The load at node_3 applies a diagonal pull downwards, producing high compressive stress in member_4 (node_3-node_1). The existing design failed to distribute this load efficiently. The structure lacks sufficient triangulation above node_3 to transfer load to supports. Member areas appear mismatched, with smaller area on highly stressed member_4 causing overstress. The load path from node_3 through node_4 to supports is suboptimal. Current member_4 is very short but highly stressed, so force redistribution is required for better performance. The supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) constrain vertical and horizontal displacements adequately. The mass above 30 results from relatively large areas on members spanning longer distances.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key issues: high compression on node_3-node_1 member, excessive mass from large area selections, limited triangulation limiting load transfer efficiency. Adding a node above node_3 and better diagonal bracing should improve load transfer. Increasing area on highly stressed members, while reducing on low-stress ones, and rearranging members to shorter lengths will help meet constraints.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss by adding an additional node above node_3 to form a more triangular upper section. Keep supports and loaded nodes fixed. Create an open-top trapezoidal truss with full triangulation among nodes node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4, and new node_5 above node_3. Use smaller areas for longer members and optimize cross-sectional areas for highly stressed members to keep stresses under 15 and total mass under 30.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Introduce node_5 above node_3 at (2.0, 4.2) to provide vertical support. Triangulate the top section by connecting node_5 with node_4 and node_3. This forms multiple load paths and reduces stress concentration on single members by distributing axial forces. Use smaller areas (area_id \'2\', 0.782 or \'1\', 0.195) for longer members to reduce mass. Use intermediate areas (around \'3\', 1.759 or \'4\', 3.128) for critical short members to keep stress within limits. Maintain pinned and roller support conditions to balance reactions.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members behave axially, length calculated from 2D Euclidean distance. Stress = Force / Area, force resolved from static equilibrium. Mass = sum(length × area constant). Cross-sectional areas chosen from provided area_id map. Equations: Force balance at nodes horizontally and vertically, sum forces and moments zero. Calculate member lengths and assign areas to not exceed 15 max stress. Estimate internal member forces by standard static equilibrium for truss. Calculate stress = force / (area × E assumed constant), max stress ≤ 15. Mass sums limited ≤30.
