The closed truss structure must minimize stress (|stress|<=20 everywhere) while keeping total mass <30, given the support, load, and available area values. The structure must remain fully connected.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Primary task is to reduce member stresses, which have consistently exceeded allowable ±20 in all prior iterations, while maintaining a mass well under 30. Input geometry fixes node_1, node_2, and node_3 on the x-axis, loaded at node_3 (@ (2,0)), with node_4 (apex) above node_3. Supports are pinned at node_1, roller at node_2.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current and similar previous designs repeatedly fail due to high compressive force in the bottom chord (node_1–node_3: -53.53), and heavy bending concentration. Efforts to reduce stress by using larger cross sections led to excessive mass but did not optimally spread the load. Historic structures with extra apex or additional panels dramatically increased mass without consistently keeping all member stresses under ±20, often due to oversized or poorly oriented diagonals. The triangle-based structures (nodes in a single panel) either over-stress the bottom chord or under-utilize the upper members. Loads applied off-center at node_3 produce significant moment; without direct ties between loaded node and supports, high forces arise. To reduce bottom-chord compression and spread force, adding a fifth apex node and introducing two more diagonals offers better triangulation and stress distribution. Also, a lower panel point at (4,0) provides additional force paths.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Notable patterns: single apex truss consistently overstresses bottom chord. Adding top or intermediate nodes adds weight but rarely optimizes stress unless triangulated efficiently. For best efficiency, the structure needs a nearly symmetric double-triangle form (Pratt or Howe) with a central top node to split the applied load more equally to both supports, keeping all member lengths short and diagonal forces moderate.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign as a five-node truss by adding a second top node (\'node_5\': (4,2.8)) above the lower right midspan, creating a twin apex. Add \'node_6\': (4,0) as a lower panel node. Connect these with members forming two adjoining triangles. Choose member cross-sections as small as possible, increasing only where stress estimates exceed ±20. This design allows direct load paths from node_3 to both apexes and toward both supports; also, it reduces the bottom chord stress by creating additional force splitting.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Using load distribution and geometry improvements: Placing top nodes at (2,2.8), (4,2.8) above the mid-span splits the vertical load into more submembers, each handling less force. Connecting (node_3)--(node_4), (node_3)--(node_5), and (node_4)--(node_5) forms a strong top chord; connecting (node_1)--(node_4), (node_4)--(node_6), (node_6)--(node_2), (node_2)--(node_5), (node_6)--(node_3), and (node_3)--(node_1) gives well-distributed support. Diagonals (node_4)--(node_6), (node_5)--(node_6) further reduce moments at the bottom chord. The design aims to minimize spans and balance compressive and tensile forces between upper and lower chords, using stiffer members (larger area_id) where needed.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: - Nodes at supports and loading remain fixed. - New node at (4,0) adds a panel; new top node at (4,2.8) mirrors node_4, so loads split more evenly. - Area_id selection starts at \'1\' (A=0.195) unless stress on the member is high, estimated by geometry: max vertical component of load split across top and bottom diagonals. - Mass ≈ sum(length × area), stress ≈ force / area. Lengths determined by Euclidean distances. Target all calculated member stresses ≤ ±20 (estimate compression highest at lower chords).
