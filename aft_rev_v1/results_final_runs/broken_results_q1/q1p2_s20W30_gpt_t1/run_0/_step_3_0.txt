The previous structures violate the max stress constraint (stress > 20) despite acceptable mass. The target is a light, fully connected structure with stresses ≤ ±20 and total mass ≤ 30. Node/support/load locations are fixed; other nodes/members may be adjusted for optimality.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Review: Constraints are max |stress| ≤ 20, total mass ≤ 30, closed 2D truss, all supports/loads fixed, use allowed area_id only. Previous solutions exceed stress constraint (e.g., |stress| = 41.78). I must ensure efficient force paths, sufficient triangulation, and correct member sizing. Prior arch-like or Vierendeel-ish approaches concentrated force, causing overload in lower chord; load is at node_3 with support span of 6m.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current and historic truss layouts show either excessive stress—especially in the lower chord (e.g., node_3 to node_1)—or excessive member mass. Patterns: The lower nodes (node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4) are often collinear, leading to high bending stresses when a load is applied at node_3. The upper nodes help triangulate but member sizes are not optimized, and direct load paths may bypass crucial diagonals. The design should maximize triangulation between supports and load while distributing forces more evenly, reducing high local forces in any single member. Efficient structures for this boundary/support/load typically include a Warren truss with diagonals and a vertical over the load application point to decrease local member stress. The current top chord heights (2.4m) can be fine-tuned for improved force resolution.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "A deepened top chord above the loaded node (node_3) will resolve the load more efficiently. Introducing an extra node at midspan above node_3 (top apex) can split the panel points and allow more direct force paths. Diagonals from supports and intermediate nodes to this apex will reduce local high force. Use minimum cross-sections compatible with stress constraint for secondary members.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign using a classic three-panel Warren truss: keep node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (4,0), and introduce node_5 at (1.5, 2.5) and node_6 at (4.5, 2.5) as mid-height top panel points, and a central top node node_7 at (3.0, 3.0) directly above node_3/node_4 to distribute the load through triangulation. All nodes fully connected in a closed web; calculate optimal member area based on anticipated force levels to keep stresses ≤ 20.",\n\n    "reasoning": "A classic Warren truss distributes loads efficiently via triangles and diagonals, minimizing peak stress and total material. Adding a top apex node centered above the span allows vertical load at node_3 to be channeled through two or more members rather than just one bottom chord. This will ensure no member carries excessive force. Diagonals and verticals further reduce stress and improve buckling behavior. Cross-sections are matched to anticipated force: primary load path members (lower chord, diagonals near supports and apex) sized up to prevent over-stress, while less-stressed internal members use minimum area. Support and load nodes are unchanged as required.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: \n1. Load at node_3 is (-10, -45) N, direction is degrees; so x = -10*cos(45)= -7.07N, y= -10*sin(45) = -7.07N, both negative (down and left).\n2. Symmetric truss: supports at 0 and 6m; load is ~33% from left.\nEquilibrium: For 3-panel Warren truss, expect max lower chord and diagonal forces near supports; top chord and verticals at apex handle compression.\nCalculations: \na. Estimate member forces by hand using method of joints. \nb. For conservatism, enlarge central diagonals.\nc. Chord: span=6m. Panel size=2m, vertical spacing=2.5-3.0m.\nd. For target force/stress: Stress = F/A <= 20; A = F_max/20.\ne. Choose area_id from list: e.g., for F = 15N, A = 0.75, select area \'2\'.\nf.
