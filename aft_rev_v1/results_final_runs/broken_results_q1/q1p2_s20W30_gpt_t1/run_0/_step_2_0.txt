Previous designs showed excessive stresses, especially in bottom chords, and did not satisfy constraints. The goal is a feasible, efficient, constraint-satisfying truss.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given: supports at both ends (node_1 pinned, node_2 roller), diagonal force (-10, -45°) at node_3. Current and historic designs both violate the max stress constraint and hang close to mass limit, suggesting too-thin members in highly loaded zones. New layout/flange thicknesses and full triangulation are needed.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current structure forms a single triangle with top chord and webbing (node_1, node_2, node_5 as top, webbing to node_3, node_4) but relies on thin lower chord elements (area_id 1) with high axial load. Load at node_3 puts high tension/compression on the bottom chord; previous designs failed where this chord was too thin (stress -62 vs. target <±20). Mass is below threshold, so thicker chords are allowed. Prior (historic) structure tried a small quadrilateral but left high diagonal stress from a severe force. Neither prior design properly distributes force via triangulation from load to supports.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Thin area on loaded members; insufficient diagonal bracing; minimal triangulation. Improvement: Use a \'Pratt\' arrangement with a top apex projecting above node_5 (the load application point) to generate favorable geometry, use thicker area on bottom chords, and triangulate all interior spans for stress reduction. Top node should be near the force application for shortest web members.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign to a symmetrical five-node truss with a raised apex above node_3/node_5, forming two triangles from each support and a connecting top chord. Add interior diagonals to complete load path from load node down to both supports. Assign thicker areas to bottom chords and thinner to less-stressed webs. Node positions are distributed for good geometry and minimal eccentricity; all nodes are used, with adjustment to node_5\'s height and node_3/node_4 locations for best triangulation.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By raising the apex node (node_5) directly above where the load acts (node_3 at center left between supports), the vertical load component is resolved directly into compression in the top chord and diagonal tension/compression in the webs, reducing demand on bottom chord. Symmetry reduces eccentric moments. Using full triangles (closed topology), and assigning area_id 2 (0.782) or 3 (1.759) to highly loaded bottom and web members, the structure will keep stresses under 20 while remaining under the mass limit. Spacing nodes to avoid steep diagonals aids in trigonometric force resolution.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: 1) Steel (or similar), structure behaves linearly. 2) Diagonal force at node_3 is split per geometry into vertical/horizontal. 3) Bottom chord likely sees highest force due to placement. 4) Chord lengths set with nodes at (0,0), (6,0), center at (3,0), apex at (3,3.2). Use triangulated layout: left and right supports (nodes_1,2 at y=0); node_3 directly under apex for load transfer; node_4 midway above base at (1.5,1.6) and (4.5,1.6) for diagonals. Use thicker (area_id 3) for main force paths: chords and diagonals under load; thinner (area_id 2) for less loaded webs.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Resolutions: Load at node_3 (-10, -45°) → Fx = -7.07, Fy = -7.07. Node_5 at (3,3.2); node_4 at (1.5,1.6) and (4.5,1.6); node_3 at (3,0). Apply vertical/horizontal equilibrium at nodes_1, node_2. Assign thick area to base chord and diagonals near load. Lengths: base = 6.0, apex to base = 3.2; diagonals ≈ sqrt(1.5^2 + 1.6^2) ≈ 2.19. Total member length ≈ (3 × 6) + (4 × 2.19) ≈ 18 + 8.76 = 26.76. Use area_id 3 (1.759) for most loaded members: mass ≈ 26.76 × 1.759 = 47, over mass limit if all thick; mix areas: bottom chord (area_id 3), webs/diagonals (area_id 2). Target mass < 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Assign: node_1 (0,0) pinned, node_2 (6,0) roller, node_3 (3,0) load, node_5 (3,3.2) apex, node_4a (1.5,1.6), node_4b (4.5,1.6); connect all, assign thicker sections to long base chord and highly stressed diagonals.
