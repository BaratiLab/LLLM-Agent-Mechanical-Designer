Initial structure exceeds max stress (36.26 > ±20), although mass is acceptable (10.38 < 30). Target: redesign structure to ensure all member stresses ≤ ±20 while minimizing mass, respecting node/support/load constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs: 4 nodes, single diagonal load at node_3, pinned and roller supports at node_1/node_2, areas as per area_id. The current structure forms a nearly rectangular base (nodes_1,2,3) with a vertical riser to node_4. Violations: excessive stress, notably in the diagonal connecting node_3 and node_4. All nodes are connected, but members may be inefficient for the load case.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Analysis: The concentrated force at node_3 (-10, -45°) introduces significant tension/compression in the diagonals and verticals. The main stress hotspot is member_5 (node_3-node_4, -36.26). The base rectangle with vertical/out-of-plane bracing is not a strong arrangement for such load; the path from node_3 to supports is long and insufficiently triangulated. Flat trusses with large spans tend to have higher stresses under point loading if unbraced. Historic structure fails due to untriangulated load path and undersized diagonals for the magnitude/direction of applied load.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The main concern: lack of triangle formation between the load, supports, and vertical. To optimize stress, forces must be distributed via triangulation. The truss shape should direct loads efficiently into the supports, reducing bending and force concentrations. Increasing connectivity (for example, by bracing the top node_4 directly to both node_1 and node_2) would create a closed, triangulated system.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the structure: Maintain all fixed node positions for supports (node_1, node_2) and the load (node_3), as per constraints. Improve triangulation by connecting node_4 (top node) directly to both supports as well as to node_3. Add a new node_5 above node_3 to act as a \'top chord\' to close the structure (bridge-type truss). This forms two vertically stacked triangles, improving stability. Choose member areas to keep stress ≤ ±20, minimizing mass by only sizing the formerly overstressed member.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A Warren or Pratt truss with verticals and diagonals is structurally efficient for such point loading. By adding a new node (node_5) above node_3, we get triangulation: node_4 to supports, node_5 as shared apex for diagonals. All nodes remain used and now the truss is fully closed. Members from node_3 and node_4 to supports, plus diagonal bracing, will yield short load paths and minimize peak stresses. Member cross sections chosen to keep stress safely below 20, using higher area only where required (based on member force calculations). Node positions will ensure member lengths are practical (not excessively long, which would raise mass).",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume new node_5 at (2.0, 2.8) (above node_4), for better depth and triangulation. New members: Connect node_4 and node_5 to all supports and to node_3 (load node), forming triangles. Estimate member forces via geometry for 10-unit load at -45°, distributed via truss action. Use statics: split vertical/horizontal reactions at supports (node_1 pinned, node_2 roller). Choose area ids: for typical members area_id \'2\' (0.782), for highest-stressed area_id \'3\' (1.759). Estimate member force per triangle as up to 10 units / sin(60°) ≈ 11.5 units, so area_id \'2\' yields stress 11.5 / 0.782 ≈ 14.7 (<20). If a member is anticipated to carry up to 16-18, use area_id \'3\'. Recalculate total mass after new member and node arrangement.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Add node_5 at (2.0,2.8).
