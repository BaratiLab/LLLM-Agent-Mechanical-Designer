The objective is to generate a closed 2D truss structure that satisfies max stress ≤ ±15 and total mass ≤ 30, minimizing stress and ensuring full connectivity and load path efficiency.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given load at node_3 (-10N at -45°), supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller), current nodes mostly aligned along x=2 vertical line except supports at x=0 and x=6. Current structure has high stress in member_3 (18.37) and members connected to node_4 and node_5. History shows adding diagonal member_9 (node_4-node_5) reduces stress but increases mass. Areas range from 1 to 4 for members, with large areas on diagonals.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has vertical nodes node_4 and node_5 aligned on x=2 with y=2.5 and -1.5, causing high bending and stress concentration in members connected to node_1 and node_2. Load at node_3 creates tension and compression in horizontal members. The structure is not fully triangulated; node_4 and node_5 are connected only through node_3 and supports, causing inefficient load distribution. History shows adding diagonal between node_4 and node_5 improves stability but increases mass. Max stress mainly in vertical members from node_1 to node_4 and node_5. The structure lacks horizontal bracing at top and bottom chords to distribute load evenly.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress, triangulation and load path redundancy is critical. Adding diagonal members between node_4 and node_5 and between node_4 and node_2, node_5 and node_2 can help. Also, raising node_4 and lowering node_5 closer to a symmetric arch shape may reduce bending moments. Using moderate area members (area_id 2 or 3) for diagonals and chords balances mass and strength. The pinned and roller supports at ends define boundary conditions limiting horizontal displacement and vertical reaction.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Redesign the truss as a symmetric Warren truss with 5 nodes: node_1 at (0,0), node_2 at (6,0), node_3 at (1.5,1.5), node_4 at (3.0,0), node_5 at (4.5,1.5). Connect members to form closed triangles: bottom chord (node_1-node_4-node_2), top chord (node_3-node_5), and diagonals (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2). This ensures full triangulation, symmetry, and distributes load efficiently. Assign moderate area_id values (2 or 3) to chords and diagonals to keep mass below 30 and max stress below 15.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "The symmetric Warren truss distributes load through multiple triangular load paths, reducing stress concentration. Node_3 and node_5 elevated to 1.5m provide efficient arch shape, reducing bending in bottom chord. Triangulation prevents mechanism failure and spreads load to supports. Using area_id 2 (0.782) for chords and 3 (1.759) for diagonals balances mass and strength. Supports remain fixed, and load at node_3 is transferred via diagonals to supports. This design is closed, connected, and satisfies constraints.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members behave as axial force members, negligible bending. Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance. Member force estimated by static equilibrium: vertical load is distributed via diagonals to supports. Mass = sum(length * area). Max stress estimated by force/area, force approximated from load distribution. Area_id chosen to keep stress ≤15. Equilibrium equations: sum forces vertical and horizontal zero at nodes. Check mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(1.5,1.5), node_4(3,0), node_5(4.5,1.5).

Assign area_id \'2\' (0.782) to bottom chord members (m3, m5), area_id \'3\' (1.759) to diagonals (m1, m2, m6, m7), area_id \'1\' (0.195) to top chord m4 and m8.
