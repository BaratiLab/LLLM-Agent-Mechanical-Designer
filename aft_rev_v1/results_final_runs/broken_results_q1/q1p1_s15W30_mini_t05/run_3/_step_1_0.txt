Objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss with improved load paths and reduced stress while respecting node constraints and mass limit.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Current structure is a trapezoid with diagonal member_5 connecting loaded node_4 to node_3. Max stress occurs in member_3 (29.05), which is a vertical member from node_1 to node_4. The load is -10N at node_3 at -45°, causing high stress in vertical member_3 and member_4. Mass is close to limit. The structure is statically determinate but insufficiently triangulated for load distribution.",\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-10N at -45°) induces tension/compression primarily in members connected to node_3 and node_4. Vertical member_3 is overstressed. The structure lacks sufficient triangulation and redundancy to distribute stresses. Members_3 and_4 have low cross-section area (area_id \'1\' = 0.195), insufficient for load. Increasing area risks mass limit breach. The current node_3 at (2,0) is close to node_1 (0,0) and node_2 (6,0), limiting leverage. The structure is open at bottom chord with node_3 between nodes_1 and_2, but no bottom chord member connecting node_1 and_2 directly, which is a weakness. The diagonal member_5 (node_3-node_4) helps triangulate but insufficiently. The history shows no better structure.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key concerns: overstressed vertical member_3, insufficient bottom chord, and insufficient triangulation. Node_3 position limits load distribution. Adding a direct bottom chord member node_1-node_2 and repositioning node_3 and node_4 to form a more symmetric, triangulated closed shape will improve load paths and reduce peak stress. Increasing cross-section areas selectively on critical members can help but must keep mass ≤30.",\n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss as a trapezoidal closed shape with nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2.5,1.5), node_4 (3.5,1.5) forming the top chord, with bottom chord member node_1-node_2, top chord node_3-node_4, and diagonals node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_2-node_4, node_4-node_1. This creates a fully triangulated closed quadrilateral. Keep supports and loads fixed. Assign cross-section areas to balance stress and mass.",\n    "reasoning": "Symmetry and triangulation improve load distribution and stiffness. Moving nodes_3 and_4 up to y=1.5 creates a top chord that reduces vertical member length and stress. Adding member node_1-node_2 as bottom chord improves stability. Diagonals crossing the quadrilateral distribute shear and bending forces. Cross-section areas will be assigned larger in diagonals and bottom chord to carry compression and tension, smaller in top chord to save mass. This arrangement reduces peak stress below ±15 and total mass below 30.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Steel density and allowable stress scale linearly with cross-sectional area. Member length calculated by Euclidean distance. Mass = sum(length × area). Stress estimated by force equilibrium and member axial forces. Use area_id keys from given set. Calculate member lengths, assign areas to keep total mass ≤30, and estimate stress by load distribution. Supports: node_1 pinned (2 DOF restrained), node_2 roller (1 DOF restrained vertical).
