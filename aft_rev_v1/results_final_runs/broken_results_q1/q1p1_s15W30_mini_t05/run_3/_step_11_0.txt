Objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss that satisfies max stress and mass constraints while maintaining supports and load positions.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Initial constraints: max stress ≤ ±15, total mass ≤ 30. Load is a -10N force at node_3 at -45°. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Current structure with 5 nodes and 6 members has stress violations mainly on member_5 (-18.82). Historical attempts show stress concentrated in diagonal members and insufficient triangulation or member sizing leading to stress peaks.",\n\n    "analysis": "The current design is a trapezoidal shape with nodes on a base line and two top nodes. Load at node_3 causes high compression/tension in diagonal members (member_5). The structure lacks sufficient triangulation and member redundancy to distribute load effectively. History shows adding members between top nodes and diagonals reduces stress but increases mass. Larger cross sections reduce stress but increase mass. The best historic design with balanced triangulation (members connecting all nodes with diagonals) has mass ~23-27 and max stress ~15.11-16.12 but still slightly exceeding stress limit or mass limit. The load path needs better distribution via triangulation and possibly raising the top nodes for better leverage to reduce member forces. Supports fix base nodes, so top nodes\' vertical position is key to reducing stress. Using moderate area sizes on diagonals and chords will help balance stress and mass.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Triangulation is critical to reduce stress peaks. Top nodes around 3.0 to 3.5 height reduce bending moments on bottom chord. Members from bottom nodes to top nodes and diagonals between top nodes distribute load better. Increasing area on diagonals reduces stress but mass increases. Using moderate area sizes (around 2-4) on chords and diagonals is a good tradeoff. Avoid overly large areas to keep mass <30. Node_3 load position fixed, so structure must efficiently transfer load to supports via triangulated paths.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss as a symmetric trapezoidal shape with base nodes fixed at (0,0) and (6,0), top nodes at (1.5,3.2) and (4.5,3.2), and a mid-bottom node at (3.0,0.0). Connect all nodes with members forming two triangles on each side and a top chord connecting top nodes. Use area sizes from the given set to balance stress and mass. Add diagonal members from mid-bottom node to top nodes for better load distribution. This closed truss with 5 nodes and 9 members will satisfy constraints.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Symmetry ensures balanced load transfer. Triangulation prevents mechanism and reduces stress concentration. Raising top nodes to 3.2m increases moment arm, reducing member forces. Adding mid-bottom node at 3.0m on baseline provides additional load path. Members: bottom chord (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2), top chord (node_4-node_5), diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_2), and diagonals from node_3 to top nodes (node_3-node_4, node_3-node_5). Use moderate area sizes (area_id \'3\' or \'4\') to keep stress within ±15 and mass under 30.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic behavior, axial forces only. Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance. Estimate member forces by static equilibrium at loaded node and supports. Use force equilibrium and trigonometry to find axial forces. Compute stress = force / area (area proportional to area_id). Mass = sum(member length × area_id). Adjust area_id to keep max stress ≤ 15 and total mass ≤ 30. Use area_id from {\'0\':1, \'1\':0.195, \'2\':0.782, \'3\':1.759, \'4\':3.128, \'5\':4.887} for balance.",\n\n    "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1(0.00,0.00), node_2(6.00,0.00), node_3(3.00,0.00), node_4(1.50,3.20), node_5(4.50,3.20).
