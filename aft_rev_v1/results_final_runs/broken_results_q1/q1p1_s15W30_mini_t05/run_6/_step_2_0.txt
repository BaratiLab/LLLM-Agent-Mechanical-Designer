The objective is to generate a closed 2D truss with improved load distribution and reduced mass, satisfying max stress ≤ ±15 and total mass ≤ 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes mostly on a horizontal base line with a vertical extension at node_4 and node_5, the load is a 10N force at node_3 at -45°. Supports are pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2, providing stable boundary conditions. Current members connect nodes with mixed areas and lengths, but the total mass is too high and stresses exceed limits.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The load at node_3 applies a downward-left diagonal force. The current structure has members with large cross sections (area_id \'4\' and \'2\') but still experiences high stress (up to 6.03). The total mass is high due to large member areas and lengths. The structure is not optimally triangulated, and the member from node_3 to node_5 is heavily stressed (-5.02). The current design has a closed loop but with inefficient load paths and heavy members. History shows other designs also violate constraints due to high stress or mass. The pinned and roller supports at nodes 1 and 2 are appropriate, but node_3 is on the base line, limiting vertical support distribution.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "A better design would redistribute loads via triangulation and reduce member areas where possible. Adding a node higher above node_3 or node_5 would improve triangulation and reduce bending moments. A symmetrical design can balance forces and reduce peak stresses. Reducing member areas on less stressed members and increasing on critical members can optimize mass and stress. Avoid large members on horizontal members by introducing diagonals that carry axial loads efficiently.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss as a symmetric, closed structure with nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (3,0), (1.5,3), (4.5,3) to form a trapezoidal shape with a central node on the base. Connect members to form triangles: base line, two vertical diagonals, and a top chord. Use smaller areas on long horizontal members and larger areas on diagonals under load. Keep supports and load node fixed. This redesign improves triangulation, load path, and reduces mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation ensures stability and distributes forces evenly. The central base node (node_3) carries the load and connects diagonally to upper nodes to reduce bending. Using smaller cross sections on horizontal members reduces mass. Larger cross sections on diagonals carry axial forces efficiently. Symmetry balances load and reduces peak stresses. Supports at nodes 1 and 2 remain fixed to ensure boundary conditions. Node 3 load direction (-45°) is well supported by diagonal members.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members carry only axial forces. Member length = Euclidean distance between nodes. Member stress = axial force / area. Total mass = sum(length × area). The max stress must be ≤ 15. Use area_id from given set, choosing areas to keep mass ≤ 30. Calculate member lengths, assign areas based on expected force paths (larger areas on diagonals under load), estimate stresses by force equilibrium at nodes. Node positions fixed for supports and load (nodes 1,2,3).",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1 (0.00,0.00), node_2 (6.00,0.00), node_3 (3.00,0.00), node_4 (1.50,3.00), node_5 (4.50,3.00). Members: base chords (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2), top chord (node_4-node_5), diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_3-node_5, node_2-node_5). Lengths calculated by distance formula.
