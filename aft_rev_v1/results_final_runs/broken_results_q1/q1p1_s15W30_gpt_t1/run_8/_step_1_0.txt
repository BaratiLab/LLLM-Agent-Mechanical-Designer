The initial structure exceeded the stress constraint (max |stress| ≈ 42.3). The objective is to produce a closed, triangulated truss structure that meets all constraints with efficient support and connectivity.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Interpretation: The current truss cannot safely carry the applied load within the allowed material stress limits. The structure must be modified—either by adjusting topology (adding/removing nodes or members, moving non-supported/loaded nodes), or by optimizing member areas, to distribute load and reduce peak member stress.",\n    \n    "analysis": (\n        "Current structure: 4 nodes—two supports at (0,0) [pinned], (6,0) [roller]; midspan (2,0); and a top node (2,2).

High stress occurs because the midspan member carries too much load as a 2D mechanism; the path is insufficiently triangulated and does not dissipate force effectively.
