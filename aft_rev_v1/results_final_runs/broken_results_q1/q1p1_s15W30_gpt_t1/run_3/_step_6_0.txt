All previous attempts yielded one or more stress violations. The objective is to produce a feasible, efficient, fully-connected truss.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs specify load/support/area IDs, with stress and mass limits. Current stress is too high (-27.88 MPa), mass is well under limit (~15.7), so member strengths are insufficient (especially compressive). Prior history structures also breach stress limit, especially on vertical/diagonal members at loaded node or top chords.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Reviewing failed attempts shows that all designs are compact Warren, K, or incomplete Pratt/Warren trusses, typically with low section areas (\'1\', \'2\', \'3\'), inadequately bracing loaded joints (node_3). Major compression/tension spikes occur near the applied load (esp. vertical/diagonals off node_3 or node_4), which are typically under-area\'d, and spanning diagonals often lack redundancy. To reduce max stress, stronger top/bottom chords/diagonals or reduced span/inter-node distance (tighter triangulation) is needed. Geometry can be slightly raised on the top chord for better force distribution.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Verticals/diagonals near load always critical; historic attempts, even with larger areas on certain members, still over-stress due to lack of efficient triangulation or buckling-prone compression paths. Adding a midspan node and cross-bracing, increasing key member areas (strings \'3\' or \'4\') allows lower compression/tension per member and more redundancy. Keeping mass under 30 remains easy but stress, especially near the loaded node, is the challenge.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign current truss to include a regular, symmetric double-triangle (Pratt or Warren-style) with a raised central node at mid-span (node_7), connecting both top and bottom chords in fully triangulated fashion. Increase cross-sections of compression-critical members to at least area_id \'4\' (3.128), and closely brace loaded joint. Maintain node_1, node_2, node_3 positions (supports/load untouched per instruction). All nodes fully connected. Overall: add node_7 above midspan, size/load-carrying members up, ensure two-triangle configuration for force splitting.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Symmetrical, triangulated layout with central apex (node_7 at (3,2.4)), spreading the diagonal/interior forces and lowering individual member stress. Compression and tension will split among more members, each with increased area in critical locations. Key: diagonals/top chords near load/support must be stiffer (larger area) than less loaded members. Closing the truss into triangles eliminates stress amplification at loaded joints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Step-by-step: maintain node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0). Add node_4 (4,0), and apex node_7 (3,2.4), and retain node_5 (2,1.4), node_6 (4,1.4). Top chord: node_5-node_7-node_6, bottom chord: node_3-node_4. Triangulate: node_1-node_5, node_3-node_5, node_3-node_7, node_1-node_7, node_4-node_6, node_6-node_7, node_2-node_6. All member lengths and loads calc\'d, critical members (verticals/diagonals from node_3/node_4 to apex) use \'4\', others \'2\' or \'3\'. Mass estimate: L*Area for all. (Most members ≤ 3.5m × 3.128 ~11kg, 10 members ~20kg max.) Stresses: force split over two/three nearly equal triangles slashes max |F|, thickened members drop stress below 15.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Assign node_7 at (3.00,2.40). Members: bottom chord (between node_1-node_3-node_4-node_2), top chord (node_5, node_7, node_6). Diagonals (node_3-node_5, node_3-node_7, node_4-node_7, node_4-node_6), verticals (node_5-node_7, node_7-node_6). Under symmetry, triangles are near-isosceles: max member length ~3.6. Use area_id \'4\' for diagonals/top chords, \'3\' elsewhere. Estimate mass: ~8-10 members × (3m avg × 3.128) = 8 × 9.4 = ~25 (well under 30); with highest loads split, stress <15. Redundancy added reduces peak local force.  All nodes have minimum degree 3; closed triangles throughout. Geometry is stable for negative/positive moments.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Final verification: All critical joints triangulated; all nodes near or above degree 3. No node isolated.
