Previous designs violated max stress (|σ|max=5.14 < 15; OK) but exceeded total mass (43.81 > 30). Optimization targets min stress under max load, total mass under 30, and structural closure.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Current structure\'s mass is too high due to generous member sizing. Several historic configs are much lighter but overstressed (>49). Critical: achieve <15 stress everywhere and mass <=30. Previous node layout forms a Warren-like truss with internal triangulation—keep compact, direct load paths while reducing over-design.",\n\n    "analysis": "Loads: Node_3 at (2,0) is the only loaded node; supports are at (0,0) and (6,0). Most truss members aim to triangulate node_4/node_5 above the base. In all prior cases, minimizing area decreased mass but pushed stresses >40-50. With generous sizing, stresses dropped but mass soared. Members near node_3 (e.g. to node_4, node_5) are critical—these should have adequate area, but not the whole structure. Pathways for force: load travels up to upper nodes, then distributed to supports. Current member-network is dense; mass can be minimized by pruning and smarter sizing. All failed historic designs maintain closures; thus, closure is not an issue—balance of sizing, layout, and efficient load transfer is.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Insight: Most mass is in long, unnecessary heavy low-stress members (base, redundant diagonals). High stress concentrates near loaded node and top chords. Efficient, minimal-mass solution: use a triangle (for stiffness) with 1-2 panels. Reduce member count by straightening load paths. Use largest allowed area only where stress is >10, minimums elsewhere.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign: Keep nodes at supports and loaded node fixed per constraint. Adjust upper node positions for optimal force triangle (minimizing force magnitudes and length). Use only essential top chord, two diagonals and short verticals; remove supernumerary lower diagonals and over-long members. Fine-tune areas per member: thickest where needed, minimum elsewhere. Adopt Warren-pratt type: base (1-2-3), top (single node), two diagonals from supports to top and top to mid (node_3).",\n\n    "reasoning": "Triangulation provides minimal, rigid, efficient transfer: Base nodes at y=0, single upper node forms strong triangle. Load at node_3 passes to top node and then both supports; minimum distances. Maximum stress occurs in those shrunk diagonals. Area of these should be set to achieve stress <10; base member can be slimmer. This forms a minimal closed loop, has shortest force path, and minimizes mass. Points: node_1 (support), node_2 (support), node_3 (loaded), and node_4 placed at approximate centroid above node_3 (to maximize vertical load path effectiveness). Remove node_5 for simplicity (not structurally crucial if rest optimized).",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": (\n        "Key assumptions: All nodes except supports/loaded points can move. Only 4 nodes.
