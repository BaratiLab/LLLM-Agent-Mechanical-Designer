The previous structure exceeded the maximum allowable member stress (abs(stress) = 40.29 > 15) but was well under the mass constraint. The objective is to minimize stress below ±15, maintain mass <= 30, and provide a closed, efficient structural layout.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given: nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), (2,1.5); load at node_3 (-10, -45°); supports on node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller); existing structure is Warren-type, but with high stress due to short vertical and inefficient triangulation for the oblique load.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current truss places node_4 immediately above node_3, forming a shallow top chord. The diagonal force from node_3 (load) induces very high compression/tension in the vertical and diagonal members connected to node_4. The short vertical separation between node_3 and node_4 limits triangulation effectiveness, causing stress magnification. Area_2 (0.782) was insufficient for highly stressed members, and changing it to a larger area would unnecessarily increase mass without resolving the poor geometry. To reduce stress and improve load flow, the vertical offset of node_4 should be increased and node_3 (the load node) should be better integrated into a central truss triangle. Additionally, a top chord (node_5) can be added to distribute the load through two inclined paths, reducing member forces. All supports and load nodes should remain fixed in position.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The stress constraint violation is mainly geometric: members are too steep/short above node_3. Strategy: raise node_4 (top node), add a top chord node_5, and ensure every node is in at least two triangles. Choose moderate-sized members (area_3/4) where stress is critical, but minimize mass where possible via shortest members at extremities.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign by raising the top node_4 (to about y ≈ 2.8), add node_5 at the midpoint of the top chord (x=4.0, y=2.2), form a double-triangle truss (Pratt/Howe hybrid), and connect all nodes via efficient triangulation. Assign area_3 (1.759) for highly-stressed vertical and diagonal elements, and area_1 or area_2 for less stressed members. All original node positions with supports and loads are kept fixed.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A raised top node (node_4 higher, node_5 newly added for top chord) will lengthen compressive diagonals and verticals, improving load resolution and lowering member forces. The two-panel truss (nodes 1-3-2 base, 4-5 top) distributes the -45° load more efficiently and creates closed triangles, satisfying structural stability. Larger area is allocated for heavily loaded members, smaller for less critical ones. Keeping original support and load node positions meets constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": """Assumptions: \n    - Load is 10kN, -45° (Fx=Fy= -7.07kN) at node_3.\n    - Node_1 pinned (0,0), node_2 roller (6,0), node_3 (2,0) load node, node_4 (2,2.8) top left, node_5 (4.0,2.2) top right.\n    - Members: M1=node_1-node_3, M2=node_3-node_2, M3=node_1-node_4, M4=node_4-node_5, M5=node_5-node_2, M6=node_3-node_4, M7=node_3-node_5.\n    - Select area_3 (1.759) for diagonals from node_3 to top, area_2 (0.782) for others, area_1 (0.195) for long chords.\n    - Static equilibrium: the double-triangulated top will reduce max member force.\n    - Estimate lengths and member forces with trigonometry, allocate sizes for stresses: Fmax ≈ 10kN → σmax ≈ F/A = 10/1.759 = 5.68 < 15, target max stress ≈ 12 for margin.\n    - Mass is sum(len × area).
