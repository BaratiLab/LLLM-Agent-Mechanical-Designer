The load is applied at node_3, supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller). Objective is to generate a closed 2D truss with minimized stress and total mass <= 30, satisfying all constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The given structure is a partially triangulated trapezoid with one internal node_3 on the base. The load (-10, -45°) applies tension and compression in members around node_3. High mass comes from large cross sections (area_id 3,4) and redundant members causing inefficiency. Current max stress is within limits but mass is not.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 (-10N at -45°) induces tension and compression in members connecting node_3 to nodes 1,2,4. Supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller) provide boundary conditions for equilibrium. Current members are long and thick, especially member_2 and member_3, contributing to excess mass. The structure is closed but not well optimized for mass. Lack of symmetry due to node_3 position on base possibly causes uneven stress distribution and inefficient load paths. The structure generation history shows constraint violation with high max stress-to-weight ratio and excessive total mass. Members number and choice of area sizes are not optimized.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce mass, need to reduce cross-sectional areas, shorten member lengths, or remove redundant members. Repositioning nodes to improve symmetry and triangulation should optimally distribute forces. Since node_3 carries the load, it should be located to aid symmetric load sharing between supports 1 and 2. Introducing additional nodes to form a stable triangle or quadrilateral with well-proportioned member lengths will improve efficiency and reduce stress concentration.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss as a symmetric 4-node closed structure with pinned at node_1(0,0) and roller at node_2(6,0), with load at node_3 located at midpoint top (3,3). Add node_4 at (1.5,1.5) to enhance triangulation and distribute loads better. Connect members to form two triangles sharing node_3 and node_4, ensuring minimal member lengths and cross-sectional areas within constraints for mass. Use area_id 1 or 2 for members to minimize mass yet keep stress safe.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Symmetry reduces eccentric loading and balances internal forces. Triangulation ensures structural stability and multiple load paths reducing stress in individual members. Position node_3 (load) at midpoint top for symmetry; node_4 at intermediate point allows load transfer paths to supports. Using smaller area cross sections is plausible due to reduced member length and better force distribution. The structure will form a closed polygon with all nodes connected and stable.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Define nodes node_1 (0.0,0.0 pinned), node_2 (6.0,0.0 roller), node_3 (3.0,3.0 load), node_4 (1.5,1.5). Members: m1(node_1-node_4), m2(node_4-node_3), m3(node_3-node_2), m4(node_4-node_2), m5(node_1-node_3). Calculate member lengths with distance formula; assign area_id \'2\'=0.782 to shorter members and \'1\'=0.195 to others for mass minimization. Assume uniform material density and calculate total mass = sum(length * area). Evaluate axial forces and ensure max stress < ±30. Use static equilibrium and symmetric assumptions to estimate forces as fraction of load magnitude distributed among members.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths (approx): m1 = dist(0,0 to 1.5,1.5) ~2.12; m2= dist(1.5,1.5 to 3,3) ~2.12; m3= dist(3,3 to 6,0) ~4.24; m4= dist(1.5,1.5 to 6,0) ~5.0; m5= dist(0,0 to 3,3) ~4.24. Assign m1,m2,m5 area_id \'2\'=0.782; m3,m4 area_id \'1\'=0.195 for initial guess. Total mass = Σ length×area = (2.12+2.12+4.24)*0.782 + (4.24+5.0)*0.195 = (8.48)*0.782 + 9.24*0.195 = 6.64 + 1.80 = 8.44 kg approx, well below 30.
