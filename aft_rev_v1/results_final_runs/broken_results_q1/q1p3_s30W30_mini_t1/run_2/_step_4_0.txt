Objective is to redesign a feasible closed 2D truss with max stress ≤ ±30 and total mass ≤ 30 under given loads and supports.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs: Load at node_3 downward-left (-10, -45°). Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 (both zero vertical displacement at node_1, horizontal reaction at node_2). Current nodes mostly line on base (y=0), with two upper nodes above. Existing members form partial triangulation but with high stress and mass exceeding limit. History shows lower stresses but high mass (44.4), or mass under but high stress (52.38). Need better balance with efficient triangulation and member sizing.",\n\n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 causes tension/compression along members that connect to it and adjacent nodes. Current member areas heavily distributed (mostly area_id \'3\': 1.759, some \'1\' etc.), producing mass over 39. Imbalance in load paths (long horizontal members, inefficient triangulation) causes some members to near or exceed stress limits. Prior historic designs with fewer nodes had lower mass but stress limits violated. Best recent structure had some triangulation but member choices and node positions caused stress concentration or mass over limit. Current supports fix foundation line, but upper nodes placed sub-optimally for load path distribution. A closed triangulated truss with nodes adjusted to distribute load symmetrically and reduce long slender members can reduce stress and mass.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns show triangulation essential for reducing max stress. Symmetric node placement above base line, with three or four nodes forming a trapezoid or triangle shapes, spreads forces well. Member areas should be sized to carry expected tension/compression with minimal mass—choose small-to-moderate areas for short members, larger for long or high force members. Avoid narrow acute angles and overly long horizontal chords. Mass correlates to member length and cross sectional area; reducing member length and optimizing areas is critical.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign with 5 nodes: node_1 and node_2 fixed at (0,0) and (6,0), keep as supports. Keep load at node_3 at (3.0, 0.0) centered horizontally between supports to balance load. Two upper nodes (node_4 and node_5) placed symmetrically above node_3 and between nodes 1 & 3 and 3 & 2, respectively, forming two triangles and a quadrilateral for redundancy and load distribution. Fully triangulate with members connecting all adjacent nodes to form closed geometry. Assign area_ids based on member length and anticipated stress, using lower area_ids for short members and slightly higher for longer diagonals. This structure is closed, well triangulated, balanced, and expected to meet both stress and mass constraints.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Symmetry about node_3 balances horizontal load components and vertical reactions. Triangulation ensures no internal node is free to deform without load resistance. Base chord (node_1-node_2) carries compression, diagonals react tension and compression from load. Smaller area_ids used on shorter members reduce mass. Cross section sizes on longer diagonals chosen to keep stresses below ±30 but minimal to reduce mass. Node_3 remains fixed for load; supports unaltered per problem. Node coordinates chosen to minimize member length and maximize height for effective load path (height ~ 3.0 m).",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume simple linear stress proportional to force: stress = Force / (area). Estimate member lengths via Euclidean distances. Mass = ∑(member length × area). Force balance: sum of vertical/horizontal forces at nodes zero. Angles determined by node positions using Pythagorean theorem for member lengths. Choose member areas from area_id lookup such that max(|stress|) ≤ 30 and total mass ≤ 30 by iterating area choices. Use equilibrium equations to estimate force distribution assuming pin-jointed truss under static load. Structural redundancy through multiple triangles ensures loads redistributed effectively.",\n\n    "calculation": "Node positions: node_1 (0.00, 0.00), node_2 (6.00, 0.00), node_3 (3.00, 0.00), node_4 (1.80, 3.00), node_5 (4.20, 3.00). Member lengths (approx): m1 (node_1-node_3) = 3.0, m2 (node_3-node_2) = 3.0, m3 (node_1-node_4) ≈ 3.35, m4 (node_4-node_3) ≈ 1.80, m5 (node_4-node_5) = 2.40, m6 (node_5-node_3) ≈ 3.35, m7 (node_5-node_2) ≈ 3.0, m8 (node_1-node_2) = 6.0, m9 (node_4-node_2) ≈ 4.47, m10 (node_5-node_1) ≈ 4.47. Choose area_id: short diagonals (m4, m5) = \'2\'(0.782), base chords (m1, m2, m7) = \'3\'(1.759), longer diagonals (m3, m6, m9, m10) = \'1\'(0.195) to keep mass low and cover tension/compression needs, base long chord (m8) area_id \'0\'(1.0). Calculate mass = sum(length × area) ≈ (3×1.759)*3 + (1.8×0.782)*2 + (2.4×0.782) + (6×1.0) + (4.47×0.195)*2 ≈ 28.5 < 30.
