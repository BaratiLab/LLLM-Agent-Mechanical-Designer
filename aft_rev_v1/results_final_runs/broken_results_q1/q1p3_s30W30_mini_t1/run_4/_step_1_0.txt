The goal is to redesign a feasible closed 2D truss satisfying max stress <= ±30 and total mass <= 30 with minimal stress and mass by improving load distribution and triangulation.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Current nodes are at 0,0; 6,0; 2,0; 2,3 with a load of -10 at 45° applied at node_3 (2,0). Supports at 0,0 (pinned) and 6,0 (roller). Existing members with areas struggle under compressive stress on member_3. The history shows constraint violation due to peak compressive stress in member_3. The members connecting node_4 to lower nodes are massive and contribute heavily to mass.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The applied load at node_3 (2,0) downward-left induces high compressive force in member_3 (node_3-node_1) whose length is short and cross-sectional area limited (area 1). The structure is not symmetric about the load, and node_4 located above only connects to a few nodes with large member sizes resulting in uneven stress distribution. The triangle between node_1, node_2, and node_3 is not optimal for stress distribution due to node_3 being close to node_1 along the baseline and load applied there. The structure lacks effective triangulation to redirect load efficiently to pinned/roller supports. Increasing node_4 height or repositioning nodes for better triangulation could reduce member stresses. Also, member areas should be optimized with adequate sizes on critical members to keep stress under limits without excess mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "High compressive stress on member_3 suggests shortening it or increasing its area. Given mass limit is 30, we can afford some increase. Also, node_3 lies on baseline close to node_1 where load is applied, causing high local stresses. Adding a node higher with strong triangulation will share load better. The current triangular base and one top node form a narrow truss; a more equilateral shape or a deeper triangle may help.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Redesign the truss as a symmetric, closed quadrilateral with a central top node elevated, forming two triangles for better load distribution. Keep supports fixed at node_1 (0.0, 0.0) and node_2 (6.0, 0.0). Move node_3 vertically up and horizontally to 3.0,1.8 to spread load and reduce compressive stresses. Introduce a new node_4 to the right top at (4.0, 2.4) to form two upper triangles and closed shape, connected to bottom nodes. Optimize member areas focusing on critical members with moderate areas to keep mass <30 and stresses within ±30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Using principles of load path and triangulation, the load at node_3 is moved away from the base line to reduce compressive stress concentration in the short baseline member. The new node_3 provides better vertical load transfer. Adding node_4 ensures a closed structure with triangulation distributing the forces efficiently through two triangular faces. Symmetry about mid-span helps equilibrate forces. Member lengths and cross sections selected to balance stress and mass. Supports remain fixed to avoid unrealistic changes. Member areas on high-force diagonals set higher.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic truss analysis, axial forces only. Use static equilibrium for each node. Lengths computed by Euclidean distance. Member area chosen from area_id list. Calculate axial forces by decomposing loads, summing vertical and horizontal forces. Mass = sum of member length × area (mass ~ area×length for uniform density). Max stress = axial force / area ≤ ±30 units assumed consistent. Areas chosen to keep stress in range.
