Objective is to generate a closed, triangulated 2D truss to reduce stress under a 10N downward-left load on node_3 while keeping mass <= 30 and max stress <= 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given load at node_3 (-10N, -45 deg) induces high stress especially in member_2 connecting node_1 and node_3. Supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller constrain horizontal and vertical reactions. Current topology is a triangle with nodes 1, 2 on baseline and node 4 slightly above. Historical best design raised node_4 higher and adjusted member areas, reducing max stress to 15.32 and mass ~18.",\n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 has significant horizontal and vertical components. Current members from node_1 to node_3 and node_2 to node_3 share load, but slender/low area members on diagonals cause stress concentrations above limit. The 3 connected-member triangle geometry limits effective load distribution. Triangulation with added internal node or repositioning node_4 can improve load path. Increasing area on high-stress members helps but raises mass. The historical design with node_4 elevated to ~3.85 and mixed member areas reduced max stress and mass substantially. To satisfy constraints, better triangulation and balanced area assignments are required.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: elevated node_4 near mid-span helps reduce bending and shift load to supports. Using area_id=1 or 2 for high stress diagonals and smaller areas for baseline members reduces mass. A four-node, six-member closed truss with node_4 elevated ~3.85-4.0m achieves good balance. Concerns: node_3 fixed at (2,0) must handle load without over-stressing connected members. Nodes 1 and 2 are supports and must remain on baseline. Insight: better load distribution through node_4 and varied member areas is key.",\n  "proposal": "Reuse the historically best performing structure (rank_1) with node_4 at (3.0,3.85), specific member areas adjusted to limit max stress under 30 and total mass < 30. This design has proven improved max stress (15.32) and mass (18.1) under similar loading and supports. Member connections are a closed triangular network. Fine tune member areas to further ensure constraints are met by enforcing max area for low-stress members and proper sizing for diagonals.",\n  "reasoning": "Symmetry about load-support axis, triangulation for stability, and node_4 elevation to distribute vertical and horizontal components effectively. Members linking node_3 to node_4 and node_1 to node_4 use medium cross-section area (area_id \'3\' or \'2\'), while baseline members use smaller areas (area_id \'1\'). Triangulation prevents mechanism failures, and varied member sizing optimizes mass. Keeping node_3 stationary ensures load and support conditions are respected.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic, small displacement, cross sections from area_id. Equilibrium: sum of forces and moments zero at nodes. Calculate member lengths by Euclidean distance, mass = length * area. Stress estimated by axial force / area. Adjust areas so maximum member stress ≤ ±30 units. Member forces estimated by statics for given load and supports. Check mass ≤ 30 by summing member masses. Use these guidelines to finalize member areas.",\n  "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1(0.0, 0.0), node_2(6.0, 0.0), node_3(2.0, 0.0), node_4(3.0, 3.85).

Member masses sum ~18.1157 < 30. Max stress estimated from FEM history was 15.32 < 30. Load transfer is balanced with minimal peak stress. Thus constraints are met.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Design respects all constraints: closed truss, no isolated nodes, max stress < 30, mass < 30, and adheres to node load/support constraints.
