The objective is to redesign the truss to minimize stress (|stress| ≤ 15) and total mass (≤ 30), ensuring a closed, efficient structure using only allowed cross-sectional areas and precise node coordinates.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The initial design is a trapezoidal truss with diagonals, but the member between node_1 and node_3 is overstressed in compression (≈ -50). The load at node_3 is large and angled, indicating a need for better triangulation and load path distribution. The mass is well within the limit, so increasing member areas is possible if needed.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure: Four nodes (node_1 at (0,0), node_2 at (6,0), node_3 at (2,0), node_4 at (3,2.5)), with node_1 pinned and node_2 on roller. node_3 receives a -10kN load at -45°, which has both x and y components. The main issue is the large compressive force in member_1 (node_1–node_3), which is not sufficiently triangulated to distribute the load. The structure is closed but not optimally triangulated for this load case. The history shows only this failed design.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key pattern: The loaded node (node_3) is not sufficiently braced in the y-direction. Diagonals exist but are not optimally placed. The stress issue is localized to member_1. There is room to increase area, but geometry is likely the main culprit. The current truss lacks a lower chord between node_3 and node_2, and the upper chord could be improved.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss for better load distribution: Add a lower chord member between node_3 and node_2, reposition node_4 slightly higher to increase the height of the truss for better force resolution, and use triangulation from node_3 to node_4 and node_2. Increase the area of previously overstressed members. Maintain original support and load node positions.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A stable truss under an angled point load requires efficient triangulation from the loaded node to both supports. Raising node_4 increases the lever arm for vertical force components, reducing member forces. Adding a lower chord (node_3–node_2) closes the bottom, improving stability. Assign larger areas to heavily loaded members and smaller areas to less critical ones. All nodes remain connected, ensuring closure.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All joints are pinned; members carry axial force only. Load at node_3: Fx = -10*cos(45°) ≈ -7.07kN, Fy = -10*sin(45°) ≈ -7.07kN. Target: member forces ≤ 15kN (compression/tension). Use area_id \'3\' (1.759) for critical members, \'1\' (0.195) for less loaded ones. Move node_4 to (3.0, 3.5) to increase height. Add member_7: node_3–node_2. Confirm closure: all nodes have ≥3 connections. Mass is sum of (length × area).",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1–node_3: 2.0m, node_2–node_3: 4.0m, node_1–node_4: sqrt(3^2 + 3.5^2) ≈ 4.61m, node_2–node_4: sqrt(3^2 + 3.5^2) ≈ 4.61m, node_3–node_4: sqrt(1^2 + 3.5^2) ≈ 3.64m, node_1–node_2: 6.0m, node_3–node_2: 4.0m.
