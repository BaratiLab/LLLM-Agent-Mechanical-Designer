The goal is to minimize member stress while keeping the structure\'s mass below 30 units and ensuring all stresses are within ±15. Only specific cross-sectional areas are allowed. The design must be fully connected and statically sound.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three nodes, a downward-inclined load at node_3, and supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller), the optimal approach is a triangulated truss. The design must close all nodes and distribute the load efficiently. All member stresses must be within ±15, and the sum of (member length × area) must not exceed 30.",\n    \n    "analysis": "With only three nodes, the most direct closed truss is a triangle connecting all nodes: (node_1, node_2), (node_2, node_3), (node_3, node_1). The load on node_3 acts at -45°, so both x and y components are significant. The pinned support at node_1 provides restraint in both axes, while the roller at node_2 only resists vertical loads. The triangle configuration is the stiffest and most material-efficient for three points, ensuring all nodes are connected and the structure is stable. The critical members will be those directly transmitting the load from node_3 to the supports.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "With only three nodes and a single triangle, the only variables left for optimization are the cross-sectional areas (area_id) of each member. To minimize mass, areas should be as small as possible but large enough to keep stress within ±15. The member from node_3 to node_1 and node_3 to node_2 will likely see the highest forces due to direct load transfer.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation is optimal for three nodes. All members must be checked for stress under the given load. Assign the minimum area that keeps stress below ±15, starting with the smallest area and increasing only as necessary. Since the structure is symmetric about the x-axis, but the load is asymmetric, member forces will differ. Calculating the force in each member using static equilibrium will guide area selection.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Pin at node_1 (resists x and y), roller at node_2 (resists y only). Load at node_3: Fx = -10*cos(45°) = -7.07, Fy = -10*sin(45°) = -7.07. Member lengths: node_1-node_2 = 6.0, node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_2-node_3 = 4.0. Assign area_ids, starting with \'1\': 0.195, and increase if stress > 15. Member force calculations via method of joints. Mass = sum(length × area).",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: L12 = 6.0, L13 = 2.0, L23 = 4.0. Assign area_id \'1\' (0.195) to all members and check stress. Using method of joints: At node_3, resolve the load and member forces. Let F13 (node_1-node_3), F23 (node_2-node_3), F12 (node_1-node_2). From equilibrium at node_3: F13 and F23 act along their respective members. Solve for F13 and F23 using geometry and equilibrium. Calculated maximum member force ≈ 10.0 (from direct load), so stress = 10.0 / 0.195 ≈ 51.3 > 15. Increase area_id: try \'3\' (1.759). Stress = 10.0 / 1.759 ≈ 5.69 < 15.
