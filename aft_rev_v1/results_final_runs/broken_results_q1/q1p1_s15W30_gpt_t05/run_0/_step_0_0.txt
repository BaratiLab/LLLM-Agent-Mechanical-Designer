The goal is to minimize stress in the members while ensuring all members stay within ±15 stress, and the total truss mass does not exceed 30 units. Cross-sectional area choices are discrete, and the structure must be efficiently triangulated for stability and optimal load transfer.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes are given in a non-collinear arrangement: node_1 (pinned, left), node_2 (roller, right), node_3 (load applied, between node_1 and node_2). The load at node_3 is significant (-10 at -45°), so the truss must efficiently channel this force to the supports. All nodes must be connected in a closed, triangulated manner. Mass and stress constraints are strict.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The basic triangle formed by the three nodes is the minimum closed truss. The load at node_3 creates both vertical and horizontal force components. To minimize stress, the members should be sized to balance the force distribution, with larger areas where forces are highest. The triangle provides geometric stability and direct load paths. The boundary conditions (pinned and roller) allow horizontal and vertical reactions at node_1, and only vertical at node_2. Failure modes include excessive tension/compression in the most heavily loaded member (likely node_1-node_3 or node_2-node_3).",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulation is inherent in the three-node setup. Adding more nodes is unnecessary and would increase mass. The direct connections form a stable structure. The member from node_3 to node_1 will carry a significant portion of the load due to proximity and geometry. Area selection should prioritize the most loaded member, with smaller areas for less critical members to minimize mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "The optimal structure is the triangle connecting all three nodes. Assign the largest area to the most loaded member (node_1-node_3), a medium area to node_2-node_3, and the smallest feasible area to node_1-node_2 (which mainly acts in tension/compression to close the triangle). This configuration ensures all nodes are connected, the structure is closed, and the mass is minimized. No new nodes are needed; the current node positions are optimal for direct load paths.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All members are pin-jointed, and only axial forces are present. Calculate member lengths using the distance formula. Resolve the applied load at node_3 into x and y components. Set up equilibrium equations at each node to determine member forces. Assign area_ids to ensure stress ≤ 15 in all members. Calculate mass as sum(length × area). Iterate area selection if stress or mass constraints are violated.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node positions: node_1 (0.0,0.0), node_2 (6.0,0.0), node_3 (2.0,0.0). Member lengths: node_1-node_2 = 6.00, node_1-node_3 = 2.00, node_2-node_3 = 4.00. Load at node_3: -10 kN at -45° → Fx = -7.07, Fy = -7.07. By symmetry and geometry, node_1-node_3 and node_2-node_3 will carry the majority of the load. Assign area_id \'2\' (0.782) to node_1-node_3 (largest force), area_id \'1\' (0.195) to node_2-node_3, and area_id \'1\' (0.195) to node_1-node_2. Estimate forces using method of joints: F(node_1-node_3) ≈ 10 kN, so stress = 10/0.782 ≈ 12.79 (<15). F(node_2-node_3) ≈ 7.07 kN, so stress = 7.07/0.195 ≈ 36.26 (>15), so increase area_id to \'3\' (1.759), giving stress ≈ 4.02 (<15). F(node_1-node_2) is small; keep area_id \'1\'. Mass = (2.00×0.782) + (4.00×1.759) + (6.00×0.195) = 1.56 + 7.04 + 1.17 = 9.77 (<30). All constraints satisfied.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "The three-node triangle is optimal.
