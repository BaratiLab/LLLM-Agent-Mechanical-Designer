The current and historic designs all violate the max stress (±15) and/or mass (≤30) constraints. The objective is to generate a new, constraint-satisfying, minimum-mass truss.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs specify load, supports, and available cross-sectional areas. Prior attempts either exceeded allowable stress or mass. Key is to balance triangulation for stability, shortest load paths, and minimal overdesign.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current and historic trusses are overbuilt (too heavy) or underbuilt (too stressed). Members with area_id=\'3\' or higher often lead to excessive mass. Members with area_id=\'1\' or \'2\' are too slender for high-force members, leading to stress violations. The load at node_3 is significant and off-axis, requiring effective triangulation and direct load paths to supports. The structure must be closed, so all nodes are interconnected with no isolated points. The load path should minimize moment arms and maximize direct axial force transfer to supports. Past failures show that simply thickening all members leads to mass violation, while thinning them causes stress violation.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: Overly large sections at all members are inefficient. Members directly on the load path (node_3 to supports) must be thicker, while others can be lighter. Triangulating with a compact upper chord above node_3 can help. Geometry should ensure short, direct members from node_3 to supports, with additional bracing for closure and stability.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign the structure for optimal load transfer: keep node_1, node_2, and node_3 fixed, but reposition node_4 and node_5 to form a compact triangle above the base, reducing member lengths and allowing smaller cross-sections. Use larger area only where high force is expected (node_3 to node_1/2), and lighter sections elsewhere. Ensure all nodes are structurally connected.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A Warren truss (triangulated, minimal nodes above the base) is efficient for this span and loading. Place node_4 and node_5 symmetrically above node_3, close to the vertical from node_3, creating two short, steep diagonals. This minimizes bending and distributes load axially. Use area_id=\'2\' (0.782) for high-force members, area_id=\'1\' (0.195) for less-stressed members. This balances stress and mass constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All loads are in-plane. Members are pin-connected. Estimate force in bottom chord members (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2) ≈ half the vertical load each, adjusted for angle. Diagonals and top chord share remaining load. Mass = Σ(length × area). Use geometry to minimize member length. Stress = force/area. Target stress < 15, total mass < 30.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Place node_4 at (2.5, 2.3) and node_5 at (1.5, 2.3) to form a compact triangle above node_3. Connect: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_3-node_5, node_4-node_5. Assign area_id=\'2\' (0.782) to node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_3-node_5. Assign area_id=\'1\' (0.195) to others. Estimate member lengths and forces. For example, node_1-node_3 = 2.0m, node_3-node_2 = 4.0m, diagonals ≈ 2.6m. Mass: (2.0+4.0+2.6+2.6)×0.782 + (2.5+1.0+2.5+1.0)×0.195 ≈ 7.8 + 1.5 ≈ 9.3 < 30.
