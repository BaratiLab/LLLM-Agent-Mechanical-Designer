Current design and historic attempts either violate stress limits exceeding ±30 or exceed total mass of 30. The objective is to deliver a closed truss structure with minimal stress satisfying stress ≤±30 and mass ≤ 30.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Load on node_3 (-10N at -45°) creates tension and compression in connecting members. Supports constrain node_1 fully and node_2 vertically. Existing node placement along x-axis at y=0 produces long horizontal members carrying significant load, contributing to high compressive/tensile stresses. Historic designs raise mass beyond limit when increasing areas or adding members. Key design lever: reposition nodes to increase truss height and triangular layout to spread load and reduce stress with moderate areas.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The current four-node layout is nearly linear along the base with node_4 elevated. Load applied on node_3 causes large stress magnitude (-39 max), indicating poor load path efficiency and insufficient geometrical triangulation. Historic designs increasing area reduced stress but raised mass drastically beyond constraints. Triangular panels reduce bending and high axial forces. Members connecting node_3 horizontally across base carry large compression/tension forces. A better symmetrical triangular or trapezoidal form with nodal height closer to load point avoids long stretched members and distributes forces. Support arrangement limits moment transfer at node_2 (roller), only vertical reaction - good to keep node_2 at base line. Aim to move node_3 and _4 slightly above baseline to improve triangle quality while keeping node_1 and node_2 fixed.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress hotspots in base chord members require redesign: likely reduce long base members and introduce truss height at node_3 and node_4 for better load triangulation. Critical to maintain closure to avoid unstable nodes. Historic structures failed either due to mass or bad stress. Select moderate area IDs (1.759 to 3.128) for longer members, smaller (0.782, 0.195) for shorter/cross members. Structural symmetry and triangulation to uniformly share loads. Fix load/support nodes as is, temporarily move node_3 upward to 1.0 ~ 1.5m height and node_4 close to load but between node_1 and node_2 for lateral stability.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Redesign truss with nodes_1 and _2 fixed at base line as supports, elevate node_3 vertically to 1.5m on same x=2 line closer to load, and node_4 slightly higher and centered around x=4.0,y=2.0. Add a diagonal cross-member between nodes_3 and _4 to improve force distribution. Use closed trapezoidal shape to improve stiffness. Assign cross-section from area_id \'3\' (1.759) for longer chords, \'2\' or \'1\' for shorter diagonals for reduced mass. This layout should satisfy both mass and stress constraints by shortening base chords and increasing height for better load paths.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "A well-formed truss requires triangles to stabilize against load-induced deflections and distribute forces. Fixing nodes_1 and _2 aligns with support types (pinned and roller). Load at node_3 best accommodated by elevating the node to reduce bending in base members. Position and stabilize node_4 offset right of the mid-span between _1 and _2 to create triangulation with heavier top and diagonals. Area choice controlled to balance stress and weight; larger areas where stress is highest to ensure stress under allowable limit. Use basic trigonometry to compute member lengths and approximate forces; assess mass as sum of length×area coef assuming unit density. Load equilibrium gives internal forces; select areas to limit stress as force/area ≤ 30.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Unit material density, linear elastic, members axial only. Member force approximated using static equilibrium in x and y directions. Length computed by √(Δx² + Δy²). Areas chosen from area_id mapping to keep mass ≤ 30. Max stress = Force/(Area × member cross-section factor) constrained ≤ ±30. Members listed: base chords node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2; top chords node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2; diagonals node_3-node_4, maybe node_1-node_2 if required. Mass = Σ length_i × area_i. Basic vector sum confirms load offset compensated by forces in diagonals and chords. Select cross sections larger on longer, heavily loaded members. Plan mass balance with max length ~4m and areas ~1.759 or less. Previous high stresses bellwether shortening base (triangular height) critical.
