The goal is to generate a closed, lightweight truss (mass <=30) with max stress within ±30, respecting loads and supports without changing supported/loaded nodes positions.",\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Load is applied downward-left (-10N at 45°) on node_3 with pinned and roller supports at nodes 1 and 2 resp. Original structure\'s mass is very high due to large areas. The highest stressed member \'member_1\' is under -15.07 stress, below allowable ±30. Constraint violated is mass, indicating oversized spars and inefficient topology.",\n  "analysis": "The structure has 4 nodes forming an open triangle with an extra node (node_3) on the base causing load introduction. Members 4 and 5 (long diagonals) and 3 carry most masses (30+/each), which explode total mass near 105. The topology connects nodes: (1-3), (3-2), (3-4), (4-1), (4-2). Key insight is this is not a minimal truss shape - it has redundant heavy members but minimal triangulation for load transfer. The load path applies to node 3 pulled diagonally down-left (from top chord to base chord). Supports are ideal division for horizontal (roller at node 2 on base line) and pinned at left base node_1. The lack of separate vertical support on the right means the tensile side from diagonal is critical. Also observed no internal redundancy to reduce member areas effectively. The current max stress of 15.07 is safe within ±30, so mass reduction is primary.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To meet constraints, mass must be cut by 3.5+ times approximatively. This suggests drastically smaller areas or stronger topology. Reducing member areas with the same topology alone risks increasing stress above limits. Hence, adding more triangular members to redistribute forces and reduce required cross section area helps. Most efficient is a planar regular shape with close triangulation such as a square with diagonal bracings like a Warren truss. Knowing nodes 1 and 2 fixed on bottom limits horizontal baseline (0,0) and (6,0). Node_3 (load) at (2.0,0) can’t move but extra nodes can be added possibly between 2 and 4 extended vertically or laterally to form closed triangles. Prefer 5-node 2D triangular mesh with smaller member length aids mass optimization.",\n  "proposal": "Use a 5-node square-based planar truss adding an intermediate node above the load node on the vertical direction, creating full triangular members that reduce peak forces and allow smaller area sections. Nodes 1 and 2 pinned and roller fixed on baseline. Node_3 (loaded) remains at (2.0, 0.0). Add node_4 at midpoint midpoint elevated to form equilateral triangle with baseline between node_2 and node_1. Add node_5 centered above load node_3 for triangulation. Connect all nodes with diagonal members forming mesh of triangles (closed, fully connected). Choose small cross-sections fitting forces.",\n  "reasoning": "Triangulation ensures geometric stability—transfers load into tension/compression triangulated members minimizing bending. Node 3 is a key load point with vertical load on mixed diagonal. Raising an intermediate node 5 above node 3 creates two symmetrical triangles sharing the load and allow members to share axial forces balanced through symmetric distribution. Cross-sectional areas can be minimized using smaller members due to lower stress. Member length is shorter thus mass decreases. Load transfer goes through node 5 intermediate top, spacing nodes evenly to balance tension and compression. Using given area_id values, assign small cross-sectional indices such as \'1\' (0.195) or \'2\' (0.782) to heavy load members and smaller \'0\' or \'1\' to others. Use basic static force equilibrium: sum of forces and moments at nodes, member axial force = F / cos/sin(angle).",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions:\\n - Load at node_3 is -10N at 45° (diagonal down-left)\\n - Member area proportional to length × given area_id\\n - Member axial force computed by equilibrium equations at nodes\\n - Max stress limit ±30; design for max force/area ≤30\\n - Node_1 at (0.00, 0.00) pinned (both directions fixed)\\n - Node_2 at (6.00, 0.00) roller (vertical fixed only)\\n\\nCalculations:\\nSet node_4 at (4.00, 0.00) (mid baseline), add node_5 at (3.00, 2.00).
