Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Objective is to create a stable, triangulated structure ensuring load transfer, minimal stress, and mass compliance.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_1": "Given three colinear nodes (0,0), (2,0), (6,0) with load at node_3 down-left (-10, -45°). Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) fix vertical/horizontal constraints. Load causes tension/compression mainly around node_3. Need closed truss - colinear nodes won\'t form closed shape, new node(s) needed.",\n\n  "analysis": "Original nodes alone form a line thus no closed polygon/triangle to triangulate load; truss can\'t resist vertical/horizontal without bending members also stressed under combined load. Introducing one new elevated node near node_3 will form a triangular shape spreading load efficiently. Members should ensure direct load path from node_3 to supports, avoid high bending moments. Area selections from given IDs must keep mass under 30 and stress under ±30 (assumed linear elastic). Optimal cross-section sizing required for efficiency.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Insertion of a single apex node above node_3 forming a triangle with nodes 1 and 2 effectively balances forces, converts moments into axial stresses. The apex’s height influences member length and stress. Triangulation ensures no mechanism or instability exists.",\n\n  "reasoning": "To form a closed truss: add node_4 slightly above node_3 on y-axis (~2.5 m height). Triangle formed by node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), and new node_4 (2.0, 2.5). Members: node_1-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3 connects as a vertical stabilizer or stay member linking to node_4 to reinforce. Area selection prioritizes shorter members with smaller areas = minimal mass & limited stress. Use larger areas for stressed chords tension/compression paths.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: All loads in plane, pinned/roller support conditions reaction forces calculated via static equilibrium. Stress = Force / Area (area chosen from given discrete options). Member length = Euclidean distance between nodes. Total mass = sum of (length × area_id value). Maximum stress = 30 units allowed. Nodes distribution and orientation via trigonometric calculations. Unknown member forces via method of joints or sections. Load decomposition at 45° confirmed load components = Fx = -10*cos45 = -7.07, Fy = -10*sin45 = -7.07 units.",\n\n  "calculation": "New node_4 at (2.0, 2.5). Member lengths: n1-n2 = 6 m, n1-n4 = sqrt((2-0)^2+(2.5-0)^2)=3.2016 m, n2-n4 = sqrt((6-2)^2+(0-2.5)^2)=4.71699 m, n3-n4 = sqrt((2-2)^2+(0-2.5)^2)=2.5 m. Introduce member n3-n4 for load path. Load at n3 decomposed onto adjacent members. Reaction forces calculated satisfy equilibrium. After force balance: Max force magnitude ~9.9 units approx., Area selections start with area_id ‘3’(1.759), smaller for less stressed members if safe. Mass calculations: sum(length×area): approx (6*0.782 for base)+ (3.2*1.759)+ (4.717*0.782)+ (2.5*3.128) = 4.692 +5.629 +3.69 + 7.82 ≈ 21.8 < 30 OK. Max stress = Force/Area <=30 ensured by selecting adequate area. Stress close to design limits but valid. Members form rigid triangle with proper support fixity and load transfer.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Check closed triangular loop formed by nodes 1, 2, 4. Connection of node_3 to apex node 4 closes structure considering load location. All unique members without redundancy, using given area IDs.
