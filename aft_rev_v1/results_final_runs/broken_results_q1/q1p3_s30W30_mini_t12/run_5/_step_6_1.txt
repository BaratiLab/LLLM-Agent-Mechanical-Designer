Objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss with given loads, supports, node locations (loaded and supported nodes fixed), minimizing stress and mass while meeting constraints.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Loads act down-left (-10 at node_3, 45°). Supports fixed at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) at base (y=0). Current design has low max stress but total mass exceeds limits. History shows prior designs have higher max stresses or mass above limit. The constraint of mass <=30 and max stress ±30 are binding. Current nodes 1 and 2 fixed. Need to reposition other nodes and optimize member cross-sections to reduce mass and revamp load path.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 causes combined compression/tension in members meeting there. Members with high stress (member_7 stress 8.15) indicate weak/undersized members or poor load path. Current structure is somewhat complex with 6 nodes and 8 members, partially triangulated but with uneven stress distribution. History structure tries simpler node sets with fewer nodes but fails constraints or has poor stress distribution. Closed truss with proper triangulation and optimized geometry should efficiently handle load and reduce member length/mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Nodes at base (1,2,3) fixed per supports/load. Elevate 1 or 2 upper nodes to form two symmetric triangles over load node_3 to distribute load. Avoid long slender members and favor triangular substructures. Preferring triangular mesh for rigidity and loads, helps control max stress and reduces large cross-section area. Balanced compression and tension members will minimize extreme stresses. Area choices limited to discrete cross-sections — selecting few members with moderate areas and some slender critical members reduces mass.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Redesign using 5 nodes total: preserve base nodes node_1(0,0), node_2(6.0,0), node_3(2.0,0) fixed per constraints. Add two new nodes above node_1 and node_2 symmetrically near (1.7,2.4) and (4.3,2.4) to form two adjacent triangles meeting at node_3. Connect members to fully close truss: Base nodes fully connected (node_1-node_2, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3), triangles formed with upper nodes, and cross diagonal member (node_1 to node_2 upper). Fix supports at nodes 1 and 2; load at node_3 handled by triangles. Choose from smaller area_id values for most members, only some increased as needed. This design should stabilize load path, minimize mass below 30, and max stress inside bounds ±30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Principles: Use symmetry and triangulation to distribute loads evenly. Keep base nodes fixed as required by supports/load conditions. Make two triangles sharing common load node (node_3) - top chord members are in tension, vertical and diagonal members manage compression. Balanced axial forces reduce peak stresses. Node elevations near 2.4 reduce long slender member effects. Member sizing driven by forces in equilibrium, assign smaller areas to tension members where stress is lower and moderate area to compression members. Closed path formed (all nodes connected), no isolated nodes. This also creates a stable geometry stiff against buckling/large deflections.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Load resolved into components Fx=-7.07, Fy=-7.07 kN at node_3.
