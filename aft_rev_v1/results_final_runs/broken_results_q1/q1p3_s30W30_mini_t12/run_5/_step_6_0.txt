The objective is to redesign a closed 2D truss with given supports and load to ensure max stress magnitude <=30 and total mass <=30, all while minimizing stress.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_1": "The load is a -10 force at node_3 at -45Â°. Supports are pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 with fixed coordinates. Existing nodes form a somewhat non-symmetric shape with diagonal braces and upper chords. Area sizing from history shows high mass due to large member areas. Stress in member_7 is high (8.155) contributing as a constraint violation precursor.",\n\n  "analysis": "The applied diagonal load at node_3 needs a strong load path through pin and roller supports. The current structure limits member thinning due to stability and max stress concerns. The max stress (~8.15) is within bounds but mass is large (41.37>30). History shows other designs struggle with either max stress or mass. The key deficiency: inefficient geometry leading to large areas needed to keep stresses low. The truss geometry is non-symmetric and has members with zero force, suggesting redundancy and potential for optimization. The current nodes do not form a classic triangulated truss shape optimized for load transfer. Also, node_3 is isolated on bottom chord without a full triangulated web. Load cracking through members between nodes 4-5-6 appears insufficient. Historic structures showing highest mass or stress correlate with insufficient triangulation or node placement too far or too close.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Patterns: stable, low mass truss to handle diagonal load needs efficient triangulation with adequate web members. Excessive member length or lacking bracing leads to overdimensioned areas and high mass. Supporting nodes define the base; load node_3 is at (2,0) forcing deeper web angles to spread load. A stronger upper chord and balanced bilaterally symmetric design will help stress and mass reduction. The base can remain line on y=0, but introducing symmetry in upper nodes and south direction aids load paths.",\n\n  "proposal": "Create a symmetric, classic triangular truss arrangement with nodes fixed at supports and load, adding two upper nodes above loading node_3 forming a triangle significantly spreading load to supports through shorter, well-oriented members. This closed pentagon-like truss featuring triangulated shape will minimize member length overall and stabilize load paths. Use areas preferring small IDs where feasible to reduce mass. This redesign changes some upper node positions for better webbing while keeping supports and load node positions fixed.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Given triangular load and fixed supports, configure nodes in symmetric fashion on top with two nodes placed near load node 3 but elevated symmetrically (~1.5 to 2.0 units higher) and close span horizontally (around X=1.5 and 2.5). Form members from load node to these nodes and from upper nodes to both supports and load node. Also connect upper nodes together. This forms multiple interconnected triangles distributing both axial load and stabilizing shapes, optimized for lower stress and mass. Avoid zero force members by ensuring all lengths and geometries support clear direct force transmission. Remain within map walls constraint by not changing base and load nodes positions.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance. Assign area IDs from 0 up to 3 depending on force path needs, preserving less critical members at smaller cross section area (0.195 or 0.782). For stress estimation: Axial force = applied load projected through load path members; max axial force should satisfy stress = force/area <= 30. Total mass = sum(length * area). Ensure mass agg <30, estimate iteratively, increasing areas slightly if needed. Node placement precise to 2 decimals: node_1 (0.0,0.0); node_2 (6.0,0.0); node_3 (2.0,0.0) fixed by load/support definition. Upper nodes: node_4 (1.55,1.7) and node_5 (2.45,1.7) symmetric profile for load dispersion.",\n\n  "calculation": "Member lengths calculated: m1 node_1-node_4 ~1.91, m2 node_4-node_3 ~1.46, m3 node_3-node_5 ~1.58, m4 node_5-node_2 ~3.10, m5 node_4-node_5 ~0.90, m6 node_2-node_1 =6.0, m7 node_3-node_1 ~2.0  m8 node_5-node_4 redundant member smaller length.
