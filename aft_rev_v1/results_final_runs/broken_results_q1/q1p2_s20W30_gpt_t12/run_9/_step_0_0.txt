All stress, support, and mass constraints must be met, and the design shall minimize maximum member stress while providing a physically feasible solution.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Three given nodes: left pinned support, right roller support, and a loaded central node. The load is large and at an angle, requiring strong paths and triangulation. Constraints are stringent: ±20 stress max and structure mass ≤ 30. The truss must be closed and connected so I’ll need more than a simple triangle. Area_id choices control stress distribution and mass. Direct force transfer (from loaded node to both supports) and load splitting are key.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Supports provide constraints: node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller), both along the base at y=0. The load at node_3, well between them, will induce significant vertical and horizontal reactions. Key possible failure: overload of the member from node_3 to node_2 due to horizontal tie, or over-stressing due to load spread angles. The shortest, direct-load paths to minimize member force are those straight from node_3 towards supports. The minimal triangulation will give a triangle. Higher order closure via additional nodes or bracing would add redundancy and resilience, but raises the mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Simple triangle with nodes [1-2-3] is optimal for 3 points but may push stress constraints, given high load/small allowed area. Try maximizing member use by forming a triangle directly; check if status satisfies all constraints. If stresses are too high, increasing area IDs within allowed mass, or slightly adding a centroidal bracing node, may reduce maximum stress. However, any superfluous node reduces mass margin. Load is at node_3, so focus on strong members from node_3 to node_1 and node_2 (struts), baseline between supports (tie) — triangle.","reasoning": "Triangulation is essential for stability. Direct members from node_3 to both supports minimize force path lengths. Bottom chord (supports) takes remaining loads. Additional intermediate node and bracing is unnecessary unless stress limits are challenged after selecting largest feasible areas. All three members must be carefully area-sized; zero-redundancy means a single failure threatens integrity. Optimize by balancing area selection against total length: member [1-2] (base tie) experiences the least direct stress, [1-3], [2-3] the most. Set up the triangle, then assign areas according to estimated axial force requirements and check total mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume pinned and roller can provide reaction (vertical & horizontal at node_1, only vertical at node_2). External force (-10 kN at -45°) at node_3 = (-7.071, -7.071) for (Fx, Fy). Compute member force components for equilibrium. Member lengths: [1-2]: 6.00, [1-3]: 2.00, [2-3]: 4.00. Anticipate high force in [1-3] and [2-3]. Assign area_id to keep all member stresses ≤20 assuming worst-case axial load equals entire vertical/horizontal content. Use area_ids higher for critical members. Try area_id=\'4\' for [1-3]/[2-3] (A≈3.128), lowest reasonable for [1-2] (base tie) — start at \'1\' (A=0.195), since this is not primary load path.

Areas: try [1-2]=0.195, [1-3/2-3]=3.128. Preliminary equilibrium: Place load at node_3; F(3-1) and F(3-2) will both act towards supports. Sum reactions. Static analysis by joint at node_3: Let F[1-3], F[2-3] balance -7.071,-7.071 in vector sum; geometry forms triangle (angles good). Solving yields member force magnitude ≈ 10 for struts each. Thus, stress = 10/3.128 = 3.20 < 20. Member [1-2] (tie) carries only modest horizontal force, less than sides — stress checks OK (much smaller force here, area accordingly small).
