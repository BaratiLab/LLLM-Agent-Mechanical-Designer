The objective is to design an efficient, closed truss for an asymmetric single load while minimizing member stresses and total mass and ensuring all constraints are strictly met.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Loads, supports, node layout, and FEM results point to an overstressed tension/compression path, likely due to non-optimal triangulation and slender \'1\' area size members. Topology re-examination needed.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The applied load at node_3 (-10.0, -45.0) is far from both supports and has a major vertical component. The topology directs most of the load through long horizontal base members and all through the highly stressed \'member_1\'. Both analysis sets show that default \'1\' area members on long compression/tension paths are overstressed (~50). The STWR is high, the structure inefficiency comes from: (i) insufficient member areas along critical force paths (compressed member_1 is thin), and (ii) unnecessary extra mass concentrated in redundant/redundant or oversize bracing. Historic structures suffer from poor load diffusion and/or inefficient bracing, plus inefficient sizing choices (especially oversizing in side chords in history, causing unnecessary mass or undersizing cross-bracing leading to high stresses). Supporting node positions or braced secondary triangle positioning might be non-optimal, resulting in load being carried across too few triangulated members.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing stress—to within ±20—and mass below 30 requires: (a) thicker areas along most loaded/useful path—the primary bottom chord, and perhaps the two diagonals, (b) optimizing node_4 and node_5 y-locations to reduce member length, particularly in diagonals, thereby minimizing force and so possible stress by decreasing lever effect, (c) careful connectivity: reduce member count to eliminate redundancy while ensuring triangulation and structural closure, (d) exploit the symmetry and geometry for even stress distribution.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Recommend a redesigned, lean truss with node positions kept for supports and node_3 for loads (as required by constraints), relocate attic nodes for better triangulation. All joints fully utilized. Members to primary supports and all loaded nodes must be large enough (increase area_id where needed), while rest may be slender. Remove excess bracing. Optimal form: a classic simple Fink/bowstring triangle type truss: nodes_4 and node_5 moved slightly for best force performance, geometry refined for efficiency. Lower top nodes y-coordinates to minimize lever arms, spreading force into more triangles within allowed mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Truss design principle calls for minimizing unsupported span length (shortest length of highly loaded member; ie, keep node_3 close to supports in x,y); maintain major triangles carrying the applied load and minimizing bending; node_4 and node_5 shifted downward to reduce the bending moments and horizontal thrust, limiting axial loads and drops in member_1’s stress towards the limits. Increased area for bottom chord and diagonal near node_3. Each member triangulates critical force path. Avoid redundant bracing: too many diagonals do not reduce stress and only add mass. Assign area_id per crude stress estimate and limit mass using direct member length × area values. Since the previous member_6 (very massive for not much stress) was almost 11 units of mass it guts design efficiency; removing it is key.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": [\n        "Knowns: Applied load (node_3), support pattern (nodes_1,2 must remain), total span (from nodes_1 to 2: 6 units), triangle height adjustable.
