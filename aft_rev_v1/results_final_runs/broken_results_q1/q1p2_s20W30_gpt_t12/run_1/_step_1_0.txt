The initial structure is overstressed, especially in \'member_5\', yet is light. The requirement is a fully closed, feasible structure.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "1. Constraints: Max stress: ±20, mass ≤ 30.\\n2. Initial stresses: max(abs(stress)) = 47.49 (significant over-limit on \'member_5\'). Mass = 11.08 (well below mass constraint, allows room to increase).\\n3. Load is (-10, -45°) at node_3. Node_1 (pinned at origin), node_2 (roller at opposite end). This is essentially a loaded simple truss span with a near-central applied force driving large stresses.\\n4. The initial structure has a main top branched node (node_4) for triangulation, but the central bottom node (\'node_3\'), where load is applied, is not ideally integrated into main stress transfer. All members exist, all nodes are connected. Member areas are quite minimal, or non-uniform for local strengthening (areas 1,2, most members using min area 1).",\n    \n    "analysis": "Analyzing stresses:\\n- Highest stress (-47.49) is in member_5 (\'node_1\'-\'node_3\', area 1): it\'s a direct load path from the supported node to the loaded node and cannot handle the applied load with such a small area.\\n- Other high compressive/tensile stresses exist but are lower in severity.\\n- Structure is already a closed truss (all internal diagonal and exterior members connected).\\n- The very small areas (0.195, 0.782) in some members result in low mass, but much higher than allowed stresses. Other members that carry load from loaded node up/sideways are getting medium-large stresses.\\n- Improving this structure requires either (1) heavier members where overloaded, or (2) architectural adjustments such as redistributing nodes so loaded node is closer to the support axis, and improved load sharing with addition of a lower-chord closing member.\\n- But, constraint: nodes with loads or supports cannot be moved. So node_3’s horizontal location (2.0, 0.0) remains. Additional nodes are permissible within instructions.\\n- To relieve member_5, increase its area and/or share load with added lower member and mid-span strengthening. Raising node_4 (increase y) can improve internal angles, spreading load and reducing chord forces, as can using ~isosceles truss height.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key insight: The overstressed \'member_5\' (area 1) is the first limiting problem. Since mass is much smaller than allowed, strengthening this member (increase area 2 or 3) is cheap and effective, but stress distribution can be made more efficient if node_4 is shifted slightly higher for a taller, more conventional top-chord arch (for smaller bar angles, sharing vertical load). Of available cross-sections, area 2 (0.782) or higher decreases stresses almost by a factor of up to ~4 from the weakest case. Also, closing the bottom triangle further (e.g., adding \'node_5\' mid-way under the span) would improve arching action.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign current structure for improved load distribution and stress reduction in overloaded members by: (a) increasing \'member_5\' area, (b) raising node_4 for greater truss depth, (c) optionally adding a mid-bottom node between supports creating two panel points under the span, making a Warren truss progression. Focus is to distribute forces efficiently and remain well under mass constraint. Members receiving the transferred load get higher cross-sections; lightly-stressed outer members remain light. All supports, loaded node locations must remain fixed. I will generate a 5-node Warren truss: nodes at both supports, center load (unchanged), raised top, and new mid-point at bottom chord. All will be closed triangulated.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A tri-chord/triple-triangulated Warren truss is best for a central top load and equally spaced supports, it handles vertical loading with efficient stress flows and minimal stochastic peak. Raising node_4 to increase truss height lowers horizontal member force and thus bar stresses. Adding \'node_5\' at (4, 0) beneath the loaded node helps split the applied load over more triangles, maximizing load-sharing and compressive chord stability, while not vastly increasing mass. Member areas are set so: high-stress bars get area 2/3, others small-economical.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions:\\n- Pin at node_1, roller at node_2. Loaded node_3 not moved for compatibility.\\n- Member axial stresses: F/A, where F from force-decomposition statics.\\n- Chord bar between node_1 and node_5 gets large fraction of reaction, node_4 (raised to y=3.5) creates near-equal triangles for best force distribution.\\n- Critical overloaded member is now substituted with larger area and \'helped\' by new bottom-chord (lower chords for split force path).\\n- Member lengths via distance formula. Choose area 3 (1.759) for critical tensile/chorded members; area 1 (0.195) for diagonals.\\n- Prospective node coordinates chosen to allow full closure and triangulation: node_5 (4.0, 0.0) equidistant between loaded and supported sides. Leads to new member system for a double triangle plus upper apex.
