The objective is to minimize maximum member stress while keeping total mass ≤ 30, maximum member stress within ±20, and ensuring the structure remains closed and all nodes are connected. Efficient geometry and cross-sectional area selection under the prescribed conditions are paramount.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes: at (0.0, 0.0) (pinned), (6.0, 0.0) (roller), (2.0, 0.0) (loaded at -10, -45°). Constraints: max |stress| ≤20, mass ≤30. Structure must be closed (connected and triangulated at least), meaning direct connections and at least one triangulated member. Optimality will require additional nodes for stress spreading.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Loads: A single downward-leftward force at node_3 violates the typical triangle configuration (nodes make a shallow triangle), so load could generate high force on left or center node bars. Both supports are along base, potentially causing high bar compression/tension. Efficiency likely improved by supporting the loaded node_3 through an above-base node (say node_4 forming a triangle). Need symmetry for efficient load path and minimal bending, and shortest possible load paths for stress reduction.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a new node above the loaded center node (node_3) will create two efficient triangles and distribute the load. Optimal height must balance force reduction (increased height) with new added mass. Consideration: Placing node_4 directly above node_3 creates symmetry and equal member forces. To minimize mass and stress, node_4 should not be high (keeps member short), but high enough to meaningfully reduce bar stress (~2.0 units upwards tentatively). All area IDs will be chosen empirically, with preference for minimal area just above calculated force/A <20.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Using a topology similar to a Pratt or Warren truss, but with only 4 nodes, optimally connects all three node supports and the loaded center. Placing the additional node at (2.0, y), kickstarts a two-triangle configuration, forming a \'Y\'-truss. By closing triangles (node_1-node_3-node_4), (node_3-node_2-node_4), overall stresses are reduced relative to spanning node_3 directly between node_1 and node_2 only. Geometry carefully chosen to create equal member lengths from supports to load and to raise height just enough to reduce change in axial force trend.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Let node_4 be positioned at (2.0, 2.0) (above node_3). Member connections: 1-3, 3-2, 1-4, 2-4, 3-4 forming two efficient triangles (ensuring statical determinacy and full closure). Forces due to -10 at -45° = (–7.07, –7.07) at node_3. Static equilibrium at unloaded nodes, supported nodes have boundary conditions. Key: calculate vertical components via geometry. Try area_id \'2\' (A=0.782) for diagonal and \'3\' (A=1.759) for critical loaded members; increase if stress limit reached.
