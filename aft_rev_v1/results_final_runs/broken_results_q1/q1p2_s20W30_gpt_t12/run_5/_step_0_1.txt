The truss has to be closed (all nodes interconnected), area IDs are discrete per given list, and new nodes may be added for triangulation if necessary, though loaded and supported node positions are fixed. The final result should present optimal node positions and consistent member selections.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given only three collinear nodes initially, a closed, triangulated truss cannot be formed without adding at least one new off-line node. The area values for bars vary greatly, permitting mass/stress trade-offs. The oblique load at node_3 creates both significant vertical and horizontal demands, requiring careful connection layout to maintain control of member stresses. Supported nodes (node_1 and node_2) are both at y=0, separated by 6 units; node_3 is at (2.0, 0.0), in-between, but will receive significant force at ⟨-45°, -10⟩, mainly downwards and to the left. Satisfying closure and forming at least two non-collinear load paths is necessary for a physically meaningful design.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Support layout is statically stable: one pinned, one roller. The original three nodes being collinear means all members would lie on the same line if only those are used—this produces a mechanism, not a stable truss. Fully connecting all three does not achieve closure in the structural sense in 2D. The load at node_3 (-10, -45°) resolves into about -7.07 in both x and y. With node_3 not elevated in y, there\'s no vertical separation—no triangle can form—so at least one new node (above or below the x-axis) is required to enable triangulation. Locating this new node reasonably (e.g., above node_3), and interconnecting node_1, node_2, node_3, and the new node, forms a minimal closed structure (a triangle with node_1-node_2 at base, node_3 as loaded, and new node as apex). All three supported/load nodes should be connected to maximize load transfer efficiency. Sizing minimal cross sections where stresses reach ~19–20 will minimize mass while respecting stress bounds. Customizing area_ids per force analysis (using larger where expected loads are maximized) is critical. The total truss mass can be computed by summing products of lengths and chosen area values.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulating the topology is key; the simplest, least-mass solution places a single new node optimally located (both vertically offset and within mass limits). The offcolinearity from both horizontal and vertical components of the applied load helps distribute force through triangulation efficiently. By judiciously sizing each truss member using appropriate area_ids, it\'s possible to limit maximum stress close to (but not exceeding) ±20. Extensive cross-bracing beyond the minimal triangle may only increase mass, so stick with a 4-node triangular truss (nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), and one elevated y>0 node). All-four nodes can be connected to ensure closure (a 4-bar tetrahedral shape in 2D). Member force directions can be estimated via geometry and symmetry; vertical projection above (2,0) will distribute the load between both base supports.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Introduce a new node (node_4) at about (2.0, y), with y > 0, above node_3 and near the centroid of the truss under the applied force direction (to most directly counterbalance the downward-left load at node_3). Connecting node_4 to all three ground nodes (nodes 1, 2, 3) closes the truss and enables triangulated load paths. Structure: Members from node_3 to node_1, node_3 to node_2, and node_3 to node_4 transmit major reactions; node_4-to-node_1 and node_4-to-node_2 form the compression system, helping resolve out-of-plane forces and ensure closure. Position node_4 vertically above node_3 (suggested y ≈ 2.4–2.6 as determined by force/moment balance; precise y-set to match constraints and minimize member force/stress).\nSize members between distant nodes (likely highest loaded) to area_id=\'0\' (A=1.0), and reduce area where stress is found lower. Ensure that primary loaded members (those from node_3) have sufficient area to limit stress to ≤ 20, and that mass totals ≤ 30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Let’s set node_4 at (2.0, y4).

Force equations: Sum Fx = 0, Sum Fy = 0 at node_3 to balance external load; calculate force in each bar by statics/trigonometry. Assume member lengths by Pythagoras: node_1-node_3: 2.0, node_2-node_3: 4.0, node_3-node_4: y4, node_4-node_1: sqrt((2.0)^2 + (y4)^2), node_4-node_2: sqrt((4.0)^2 + (y4)^2).\nTrial y4 = 2.40, check member forces: estimate that with smaller y4, vertical height is sufficient for truss action; if members not over-stressed, reduce area for massspaving. If |stress|>20 found on a member, increase area only wherever required. Set primary member cross-sections to area_id=\'0\', relax to smaller area_id for secondary. Use symmetric position for node_4 for efficiency. Calculate total mass: sum(length * area_value over all members).
