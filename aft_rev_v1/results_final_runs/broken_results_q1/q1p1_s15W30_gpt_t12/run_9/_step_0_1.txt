The optimization objective is to minimize member stresses and total mass while ensuring all connection, load, and support requirements are strictly satisfied.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "We are provided three aligned nodes, with a large diagonal loading and opposing supports. Constraints are strict on both stress and total mass. All possible members must be chosen efficiently, trading off between sufficient area (low stress) and mass limits.",\n\n    "analysis": "Nodes are nearly collinear, but necessary triangulation for structural closure and stability will require an extra (non-collinear) node. Primary load transfer is from node_3 towards the supports, meaning diagonal members will be crucial. Triangulation is most effective for stress minimization when carrying angled and large forces at an interior node. Without sufficient triangulation, a basic truss will be heavily overstressed. The effective force will be distributed between all members connected to node_3. Efficiency will improve by adding a fourth node forming a nondegenerate triangle, likely above the loading direction, to double direct load paths and improved closure.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "A new node (node_4) should be added above the mid-node_3, forming two triangles. Assessing geometry: node_4 at about (2, 2.5) follows the typical height for optimal force path splitting (equilateral/isosceles close to mid-height keeps many force components direct). Each region between supports and loads becomes a triangle—resisting the applied force with minimized bending. All existing and new nodes are then fully connected.",\n\n    "reasoning": "To minimize peak stress, the load must be distributed to both supports through short, symmetric diagonal paths. The added node_4 above node_3 at (2.0, 2.5) splits angled loads to the left (node_1) and right (node_2), and left midspan (node_3), creating triangulation and relaxing force concentrations. All nodes are connected forming a closed, triangulated structure. Select smallest areas that keep stresses ≤15 using direct truss force/stress calculations. If critical members (close to max stress) still induce excess mass, iterate up on area, otherwise use minimum-unity area where possible.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Key assumptions: Pin all supports as specified. Approximate member forces by standard statics: for triangle node_3-(1,2)-(2,2.5),(2,2.5)-(0,0),(2,2.5)-(6,0),(3)-(2,2.5), etc. Member stress = Force/area. Calculate force in each member by resolving loads at nodes through equilibrium: most load passes to node_4, split spatially. Then numerically evaluate member length × area for mass. Use smallest area yielding |stress|≤15 in all members. Simple truss equilibrium via three/joint method (method of joints) is adequate: at node_3, split the -10 @ 45° into symmetry: F_diag_left, F_vert, then evaluate downstream splits. Recalc masses and adjust if total mass above constraint.",\n\n    "calculation":\n        "Step 1: Place node_4 at (2.0, 2.5), high enough for triangulation but not overstretched (midspan vertical easier statically).
