The objective is to minimize member stress, ensure maximum stress stays within ±15, and keep the overall truss mass ≤ 30, by potentially introducing new nodes.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three nodes in a horizontally-elongated, non-collinear triangle. Node_1 (0.0,0.0) is pinned, node_2 (6.0,0.0) has a roller, and node_3 (2.0,0.0) is between them and holds a load (-10N @ -45°). At minimum, closing the triangle is needed but triangulation for stability against bending/failure may be desirable.",\n\n    "analysis": "A simple triangular truss using only the three supplied nodes forms a line (degenerate triangle with all three on the x-axis), making triangles impossible and likely resulting in singularities or excessive stress in straight-line members. To alleviate this, one must introduce a fourth node off the x-axis—forming a \'classic\' truss—a triangle with a vertical to anchor node_3’s vertical force component, and diagonal members to direct load efficiently to supports. The strongest force is at node_3, minus x and y in equal amounts (F_x = -7.07, F_y = -7.07). The load will split along the truss members and supports pushing and pulling accordingly. Given constraints, member lengths and total mass must be managed carefully.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "The critical patterns: a planar triangle is critical for load distribution, but no triangle can be made with original nodes because they are collinear (all at y=0). To close the structure, I must add a new node not on the x-axis; logical locations are either above or below, symmetrically, near node_3 where the force is applied, to minimize the lengths and thus total mass. At the same time, must carefully pick area IDs to ensure no member gets overstressed given expected force magnitudes.",\n\n    "reasoning": "To maximize load transfer efficiency (lower member force, minimize peak stress per member), add node_4 at (2.0,2.5)—placing it directly above loaded node_3 creates vertical and diagonal force paths to node_1 and node_2. Connect (node_1, node_3), (node_3, node_2), and connect node_4 to each original node. This new triangulation routes vertical loads efficiently to the supports, keeps member lengths short, and offers force sharing among more members (the classic Pratt/Warren truss arrangement). Areas chosen prioritize higher areas where needed most (vertical member under direct load at node_4) and minimal where only needed for stability (long diagonals).",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume pin-jointed connections, all bars only handle axial load. Assign nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), newly added node_4(2,2.5). Members: (1-3), (3-2), (1-4), (4-2), (3-4). Calculate:\n        a) Length for each member: \n            (1-3): 2.00; (3-2): 4.00; (1-4): sqrt(2^2 + 2.5^2)=3.20; (4-2): sqrt(4^2 + 2.5^2)=4.72; (3-4): 2.5\n        b) Compute nodal equilibrium to estimate member force directions/magnitude; vertical (3-4) must absorb most of F_y. Estimate member forces with basic joint method (primary at loaded joint and symmetry). For preliminary sizing: pick ID \'5\'(4.887) for member (3-4) (high area at direct load), ID \'2\'(0.782) for others to minimize mass.\n        c) Explore mass: sum(length*area) < 30.\n        d) Stress per member = F_member / area, ensure |stress|<15 everywhere.",\n\n    "calculation": "Member_3-4 is vertical and takes almost all F_y: F=7.07, area=4.887⇒stress=1.45 (‘safe’).
