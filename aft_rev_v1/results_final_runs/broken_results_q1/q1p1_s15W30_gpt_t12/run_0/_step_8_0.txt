Previous iterations violate stress constraints or total mass, so the aim is to achieve max(abs(stress))≤15 and mass ≤30. Nodes under supports/loads are fixed as required. All nodes must maintain structural interconnectivity, so the refined closed truss should be efficient and stable under the prescribed load.",\n  \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Current constraints: abs(stress)≤15, mass ≤30, all nodes connected. The initial/previous solution at node_4=[3.5,3.05] with member_2 (\'node_1\', \'node_3\', \'1\') experiences critical overstress (41.64>15). Structure history shows best constraint-satisfying stress for node_4 close to 2.95 but at the cost of high weight (lowest max stress ranked designs have ~24-25 mass). Members using minimal area at key compressive/tensile points have failed. Node positions matter for efficient load path triangulation.",\n\n    "analysis": "node_1=[0,0] (pinned), node_2=[6,0] (roller), node_3=[2,0], node_4 varies (elevated). A negative 10 unit load acts at node_3 at 45° down/left, producing significant force in members attached to node_3. Optimal load transfer requires spreading the inclined load quickly between supports while leveraging triangle geometry and minimizing member lengths. Prior optimized designs concentrate node_4 in 2.5-2.95 vertical with 3.5 horizontal – closer to node_3 = stronger triangles, less bending in midspan members. Failure analysis: highest stress in member_2 (\'node_1\',\'node_3\'). Typical failure appears in slender, direct-link members under direct action of the applied force. Increasing cross-section where highest demand or adjusting layout to either fold node_4 closer to the load node (increase triangle height, reduce span of direct member), or energize better load-sharing through increased triangulation at midspan (potentially node_5). In previous ranked structure (node_4=[3.5,2.95]), all members are area_id≥2 (0.782), and smallest stress is 10.14, mass~24. The minimal total mass solution migrates node_4 downward (to ~2.5), achieving as low as 14.2 mass but stress jumps to ~15.9 not always under threshold.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "High stress persists in direct compression/tension members between support and load (notably member_2). Increasing node_4 height softens these stresses but lengths (thus mass) go up. For optimal stress <15, solution trends toward slightly raising node_4, using a mix of robust (area≥2 or 3) in compression, and weight saving where stresses are low (area 1–2). Closed trusses need all perimeter and at least one or two diagonals on upper triangles. Node_5 is not strictly necessary, but could permit further optimization, though risk increasing mass. Solution space: focus on area_id allocation not node proliferation.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign slightly from rank_1/rank_2 by raising the upper node slightly higher than historical optimum (~2.95→3.15), while keeping node_3 at [2,0], and support locations fixed. Deploy a triangle bracing configuration with robust member sizing. Members between nodes 1,3 and 1,4 (problematic before) receive higher area allocation (id 3 or 4). All support/load and interior connections are preserved; the design remains closed/triangulated.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Triangulation ensures redistribution of loads and maximal stiffness. Increasing the vertical elevation of node_4 marginally will redistribute some of the force-couples off the loaded member and help meet the stress criterion. Variably up-sizing highly stressed diagonals and allowing less-stressed horizontal member(s) to remain light achieves mass control. Avoid introducing supernumerary nodes which inflate member counts and mass. Historical analysis suggests all previous stress improvements correlate with mildly increasing the vertical offset of node_4 and robust midspan member sizes.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": """Assumptions: \n      - All nodes are jointed/pin-connected.\n      - Members mostly experience only axial (2-force member) stresses.\n      - Statically determinate form so proceed with hand limb-by-limb force equilibrium (estimate only, full FEM not used).\n      - Calculations use trigonometry, law of sines for forces at node_3.\n      Nodes: node_1=(0,0), node_2=(6,0), node_3=(2,0), node_4 ≈ (3.5,3.1). \n      Load F at node_3: -10sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -7.07 X and Y.\n      At node_3: Three connected members transmit load: to node_1, node_2 (horizontal); to node_4 (diagonal up/right).\n      Geometry at node_3: \n           - node_1–node_3 horizontal: 2 units,\n           - node_2–node_3: 4 units,\n           - node_3–node_4: sqrt[(1.5)^2+3.1^2]≈3.43 units.\n      Assume diagonal absorbs some of the load: initial split 60% through diagonals, 20% in each horizontal.\n      Inverse stretch check for max stress: max member force ≈ shooter: -10*0.6/area at compressive diagonals → area_id 3 or 4.
