The unmet constraints prompt a re-engineered, closed truss with a more optimal internal force distribution that minimizes stress.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "The design must transfer a load at node_3 (-10 kN at -45°) through truss members to a pinned support at node_1 and a roller at node_2. Geometry and connections critically govern stress, and currently, both the ends and particularly the near verticals experience high force. All nodes must participate without isolation, and max stress/tension or compression <= 15 is required.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure is a non-optimally triangulated vertical \'frame\' with node_4 creating a non-triangular load path at the upper portion, leading to immense force in diagonals (esp. members 4 & 5). Members spanning node_1 to node_4 and node_2 to node_4 bear most of the load, exacerbated by a lack of efficient triangulation near the point of load application (node_3). This region needs better force dispersal to cut peak stress. Historical structure consistently violates stress constraints due to uneven load-sharing.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key pattern: Direct diagonal bracing and strong vertical triangulation with partial force from node_3 led into node_4 before running inefficiently through weak laterals (area \'1\'). Loads likely travel from node_3 through adjacent triangle paths ([node_3]-[node_4]-[node_1]) and ([node_3]-[node_4]-[node_2]) leading to stressed top chords.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Rather than marginally increasing member sizes (heavier), I propose adding an upper node (node_5) above node_3 and node_4, closing with a double-triangle. This enhances triangulation, forms a more efficient load transfer upstairs, and places the loaded midspan strategically. We\'ll connect node_5 to all base nodes and node_4; optimize cross-section assignment; maintain node_3 at (2.00,0.00) to keep the load location and supports untouched.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Good truss design for focal loads splits force through direct, symmetric triangles to supports. Adding node_5 above, at (3.0, 2.8), will divide the drastic force from node_3 between upper chords, while two distinct strong triangles (base/upper) distribute both vertical and lateral portions to supports. This configuration decreases lever arms on members 4 & 5 analogs and spreads load more equally across the structure (especially diagonals). Lower-chord triangles remove near-column action, strongly cutting stress peaks. We\'ll select efficient areas—lowest viable—for all members under 15 max stress once force paths are minimized.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": [\n        "Let node_5 = (3.0,2.8) (centred, higher for better vertical splitting).",\n        "Members: Connect node_1,2,3,4,5 as follows:",\n        "Triangles: [node_1, node_3, node_5], [node_2, node_3, node_5], [node_1, node_5, node_4], [node_2, node_5, node_4], [node_3, node_4], [node_1, node_2] (closing base).",\n        "Assign cross-sections: Try \'3\' (1.759) for diagonals base-to-top (take major load), \'1\' (0.195) for braces.",\n        "Estimate axial force: Load at node_3 at -45°, so both X and Y members see simultaneous thrust.
