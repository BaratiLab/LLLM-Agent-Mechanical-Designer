Current and historical designs fail the stress or mass constraints. The goal is to generate a fully connected (closed) truss, minimizing stress and total mass so that max|stress| ≤ 15 and mass ≤ 30, per area choices.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: achieve minimal mass (<30) and safe stress (|σ|≤15).

Most overloaded/member mass-consuming chords and diagonals are from node_3 and apex elements (node_3–node_4, node_4–node_1, node_4–node_2).\n    """,\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Good designs cluster node_4 between y≈2.5 and y≈2.8, but increased y tends to drive both stresses/mass up. Excessively high locations for node_4 (y>2.95) significantly drive up stresses/mass. Smallest masses (mathematically) emerge in units with y≈2.5–2.7 and lean trapezoidal layout. Over-compact designs lead to heavy members or higher stress elsewhere (member_2 e.g.). Assignment of minimum sufficient area is critical—especially at high stress links (for node_3 bearing the inclined external force).
