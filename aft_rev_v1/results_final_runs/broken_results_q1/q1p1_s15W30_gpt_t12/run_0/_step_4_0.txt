Supports are \'pinned\' at node_1 ([0.00, 0.00]) and \'roller\' at node_2 ([6.00, 0.00]). Objectives: ensure maximum member absolute stress does not exceed ±15, keep total structure mass ≤30, all while using only chosen area_id values, and maintaining a closed truss (no isolated nodes, all form a structural loop/surface). The current best design in history violated the max stress; the next-best was overweight. The goal is a single feasible, minimal-stress layout.",\n \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Target: Resolve over-stressed members, reduce mass while preserving triangle-based closure. Must keep supports and loaded node fixed, and all nodes structurally participating. Edge nodes [0,0], [6,0], [2,0] (load), [3.5,h] (h≈2.4~2.5) favor a \'kite\' truss triangle; mass and stress driven by diagonal/bar member areas.",\n \n    "analysis": "Current structure ([Iteration 3], node_4 at [3.5,2.4]) reaches max stress 16.23 (>15) in member_2 connecting nodes 1-3 (and it\'s got thin section: area_id \'2\'/0.782). Past designs favor node_4 algo at [2.0-3.5,x>2.0,y>2.4]; shifting node_4 up increases length/moments latearly but can reduce stress. In history: Rank_1 puts node_4 at [3.5,2.5], which reduces max stress to 10.55 but inflates total mass (24.96→upper screening, but not optimal for mass). Lower area members benefit mass – but overloaded adopted in thin places. Larger sections drive up member weights, especially for longer members. Members directly supporting the point load (3-4, 4-2, 4-1) critical for peak stresses and thus prime candidates for careful area allocation or path modification. Remaining linkage (node_1-2, 1-3, 2-3) closes and adds auxiliary transfer.",\n \n    "scratch_pad_2": "The triangle comprising nodes [1,3,4], and secondary triangle [3,2,4], form double load paths to ground, resulting in peak force in either 1-3 (axial, small area→overstrressed), or diagonal compression/tension in the upper/far side. Adding area increases mass; moving node_4 slightly (upward to 2.65–2.80, or shifted for better angles) can reduce force projections. Thin members should be upgraded only where overloaded; \nbalance area-size for stress. Consider slightly moving node_4 up and right for leverage. Remove redundant over-weighted diagonals.",\n \n    "proposal": "To resolve the overloaded member (member_2: 1-3) and avoid exceeding total mass of 30 while minimizing the max stress, adjust node_4 to a position giving better triangulation force split (slightly higher and shifted from both extremes found in history!). Organize all members in closed triangles, retain total member count, optimize areas: widen area for troubled members, shrink for lightly loaded, ensure no member underutilized. Estimated new node_4: [3.7, 2.65], maximizing vertical transfer, but allowing forces to flow diagonally, reducing axial in most stressed drags.",\n \n    "reasoning": "Principles applied: (1) triangulation for geometric stiffness and stability; (2) distributing external load over multiple, non-colinear paths to prevent local member overload; (3) hierarchical member dark—minimum necessary areas for heavily loaded segments, minimum allowable for lightly loaded connections. Node_4 at [3.7, 2.65] allows increased triangle height, decreasing 1-3 force, spreading load in 3-4, 4-2; avoids increasing mass excessively. Remove unnecessarily overspecified areas.","scratch_pad_3": "List key steps: (1) Member 1-3 overloaded (stress=16.23>15, area=0.782), so upgrade to area_id=3 (1.759). All area assignments checked for minimum needed for stress. Node_4 moved to [3.7, 2.65]. Quickassess using axial force balance: for truss tied between [0.00,0.00]↔[6.00,0.00] (base), [2.00,0.00](load vertical, -45°, thus transmitted in proportion to bar length, sin/cos), [3.7,2.65] high point; area sizing set from stress back-calculation (Force = Stress*Area). Keep all nodes connected. Total mass estimation for 6-member closed truss.",\n \n    "calculation": "Assign node_4=(3.70,2.65): compute member lengths (using sqrt(dx^2+dy^2)). Start with base areas (use prior history where viable—thin for base, mid/large for load-paths), then increase area where former stress exceeded limit. Estimate member force under combined node_3 loading (and triangle, via statics where load at 3 splits to 3-4, 3-1; provide thickest member along this critical path). For rough estimation: member_2 (1-3): raise area to id=3; member_4(3-4): set area_id=3; apex diagonals (3-4, 4-2): mid size; base (1-2): minimal if stress is low. Compute mass: length*area sum. Confirm closed truss, all nodes linked, area matches needs and stress for every member <=15; sum of masses <30.","scratch_pad_final": "Double inspect: 1) All constraints now targeted, all nodes in closed circuit as triangles [1-3-4-2] plus base 1-2, all required areas carefully set. Check that no member is under- or over-sized, move node_4 if any individual member would exceed ±15 by further computation, but this location plus area boost reduces prior peak by >40%. Members with prior low stress assigned minimum weight areas.
