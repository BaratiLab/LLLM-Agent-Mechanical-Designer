All structure constraints must be satisfied: max(|stress|) <= 15, total mass <= 30, and all nodes and members structurally connected and justified.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective is to design a light truss (M <= 30) where no member stress exceeds ±15, using only permitted area IDs. The main challenge is effective force distribution with no stress or mass violations, using fixed boundary-support (node_1 pinned, node_2 roller) and keeping all nodes/load application as-is.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current design has a total mass of 37.19 (over the 30 limit) beating max stress constraint at 6.18. Historic best scored structures are lighter, but beam stress occasionally spikes above 10-12. The load on node_3 (-10 kN @ -45°) implies signficant force horizontally and downwards. Key stress paths transmit from node_3 through node_4 to both supports. Current/prior designs have overly heavy diagonals or insufficient member reactivity, and sometimes ground/verticals are too long. Observed: some diagonals and lower members are oversized to compensate for force transfer.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing mass means removing unnecessary member redundancy, locating node_4 close to force resultants, and fine-tuning diagonal slopes for shorter paths and fewer oversize members. Shifting mid-top node lower could reduce compression/expansion on upper/lower chords. Best historic design used smaller areas and some identical area members; a non-triangle (quadrilateral) system led to local overstress; should preserve full triangularization for stability but avoid extra-long elements.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign topology while reusing fixed nodes/loads/supports. Bring node_4 slightly closer to node_3, reducing excessive diagonals and keeping the truss more equilateral and compact. Use full triangulation—no unnecessary members—and tune area_ids: minimum for horizontals/upper chords, mid to large only where exploits stress transfer. Remove excess diagonals from previous structures. No change to supported/load nodes.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "A vertical/trapezoidal truss with nodes at [(0,0),(2,0),(6,0),(approx (3.3,2.1))] minimizes stress by equalizing member lengths and inclinations — forming roughly \'isosceles\' triangles above the base. Diagonals (node_2—node_4, node_1—node_4, node_3—node_4) must carry force from loaded node_3 efficiently to both supports. Posts/node-chains along base handle the horizontal component. Assign smallest area_id to non-critical mid chord (node_1—node_3), moderate diagonals, and only size up where force calculations confirm need. Reduce top member length (node_4 location); avoid overly acute triangles. Test area assignments: lighter member_ids on sides, modest midmouth node raising gives shortest path for load.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: - Static equilibrium holds; joint nodes (ideal truss) transmit forces only in-member. - Linear calculation: For load L at node_3, distribute negative-x,-y as two member actions (node_1/node_4 & node_2/node_4 spaces must supply all base-reaction, area equilibrium). Calculating: projection vectors—each chord will see F*cos(angle to horizontal or compressed direction). For (node_3 -> node_4), the geometry/bar force is highest, size S chosen as necessary. Lower base (node_1-node_2, node_2-node_3) assigned smallest area_id allowed due to low direct force. Perimeter design — triangulate all panels and check member length × area. Use area_id=\'2\' (A=0.782) or lower on all base, diagonals mid (id=4, A~3.128) sharply for diagonals if calculation/constraints allow. All member-additions checked to guarantee closure.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Estimate forces: The -10kN @ -45° at node_3 resolves ~-7.07kN in both axes. With node_1 pinned, node_2 roller, main path for vertical is to ground (base). Place node_4 at (3.30,2.10). Calculate member lengths: node_1—node_3 (2.0 m); node_3—node_4 (2.22 m); node_4—node_2 (3.53 m); node_1—node_4 (3.88 m). Assign: base (node_1—node_2)—A=0.195 (\'1\'), as are all short unloaded pairs (\'1\' or \'2\'), diagonals carrying load sized \'3\' (A=1.759 or id=\'4\' A=3.128) if in tension/compression but keep minimal based on inferred force demand. Approx member loads: diagonals up to ~10kN, so use member area = 1–3 only if not exceeding allowable stress (F/A = S). For \na 10kN load and area id=\'2\' (A=0.782): F/A = 10/0.782 = 12.79, which satisfies the 15-limit. For safety, diagonals node_3—node_4, node_4—node_2 with area id=\'2\' or \'3\' (A=0.782, or 1.759 for even lower stress if needed).
