The current max(abs(stress)) = 16.28 > 15 (constraint), total mass is 13.25 < 30 (ok). Objective: redesign the structure so all member stresses are ≤ 15 (absolute), mass is minimized, and every node is part of a fully connected, closed truss.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Start by reviewing node, support, and load positions, the existing/constrained structure, and why past and present designs failed constraint. Primary focus: stress constraint at 15 (currently 16.28, compression edge). Possible options: thicken key members, reposition nodes (if not constrained), deepen truss vertically to allow longer force flow, minimize long, compression-prone elements.",\n\n    "analysis": "Given: Pinned support at node_1 (0,0), roller at node_2 (6,0), load at node_3 (2,0) of 10kN (down-right, -45°). Truss: (Prev) \'Warren\'-like with top node_4 centrally. Key over-stressed member: \'member_1\' (node_1-node_3) in strong compression (-16.28 MPa). Nodal location of load at node_3 creates a severe short horizontal force path, that tends to over-stress the member linking node_1 node_3. Generation history suggests making truss deeper (i.e., increasing y-coords) may reduce max stress but must balance buckling risk, and mass rise. Box/closed-truss with extra upper/lower chords could lower max member stress distributed amongst more diagonals. All nodes are connected but current configuration channels most force directly into \'member_1\', causing its stress limit infringement. Simply thickening member increases mass, potentially missing optimal solution.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Truss is getting overloaded through shortest lower member; adding length to upper path, more evenly splitting load, should bring max stress beneath threshold. Both prior configurations see failure at maximum volcanic chord/diagonal member. Structural efficiency will result by increasing internal height, creating equilateral (triangularized) patterns centered about node_3\'s load – shifting node_4 slightly above node_3 improves diagonal force path, and adding an upper chord node at node_5 near midpoint (for central triangulation) should close the frame and distribute loads.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign, keeping all supports and loaded nodes fixed. Elevate \'node_4\' to form a deeper top-chord. Add new node_5 above \'node_3\', increase closure via top and bottom chords for redundancy. Use the smallest cross-sectional area for top/bottom chords consistent with <15 MPa—heavy diagonals where load flows. Organize as a prismatic, almost symmetric truss, applying small y-ordinate for node_5 to distribute load optimally. Full connectivity—a double-triangle span—is preferred.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Structural triangulation distributes loads efficiently. Raising/adding to top-chord moves critical diagonals away from buckling/compression stress. Cross-sectional areas can then be minimized. All load must path toward supports without long stretched high-compression members. Moving truss apex just above load up in y-direction approximately 1.5x baseline ensures deeper/stronger truss action without undue material. Triangulate everything for closure. New \'node_5\' positioned above node_3 (midspan), links to both supports, and surrounding upper/lower chords control force dispersion.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: (a) Only free (not support/load) node positions move. (b) Members are ideally pinned; check geometry for triangle connectivity. Nodal height estimation: existing truss upper y=2.0 yielded stress ~16.28, so increase to 2.5-2.8 W/T larger y usually decreases force in highly-stressed member. Adjust \'node_4\' (was (3,2)) => (3,2.6); add \'node_5\' at (2.8, 1.7) directly above node_3 for greater distribution. Members: all base-to-top and adjacency; check area accommodation for limit 15MPa in calc. Estimate force partition by layout and assign less material to noncritical webs.",\n\n    "calculation": """\n    Node locations chosen:\n        node_1: (0.0, 0.0), node_2: (6.0, 0.0) [supports]\n        node_3: (2.0, 0.0) [load - static by constraint]\n        node_4: (3.0, 2.60) [moved upper apex, symmetric w.r.t. structure]\n        node_5: (2.8, 1.68) [new, just above load node; balances force upward]\n    Members (basic load transfer, each triangle overlapped):\n        - Lower: node_1-node_3-node_2\n        - Top: node_4-base spanning: node_1–node_4, node_2–node_4; node_4–node_5; node_5–node_3\n        - Additional: node_3–node_5; node_1–node_5, node_2–node_5; crisscross—all form triangles\n    For force-scale: Provided load at node_3 is dispersed to triangle vertices leading to top-chord lowering peak force.
