The existing truss exceeds the stress constraint (max|stress|>15) despite being relatively light, showing inefficiency in force path and cross-section assignment. Optimization aims to redesign or improve connectivity/node positions — prioritizing closed topology, max|stress|<=15, and feasible total mass (<30), while keeping support/load nodes fixed.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Given: Loads on node_3 (-10kN at -45°), supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Current node locations: node_1 (0, 0), node_2 (6, 0), node_3 (2, 0), node_4 (3, 1.5). Current maximum stress is 54.06 (fail), mass quite low (10.3). Areas likely too small at critical paths. Structure is a typical trapezoidal \'pratt\' form but the diagonal-loaded joint is inefficiently supported. Constraints are an absolute must; feasibility > weight optimization.",\n\n    "analysis": "The existing structure is a nearly‐triangulated trapezoid (incl. base), with node_3 between both supports and with a distributed force (-10 @ -45º) at node_3. High peak stress (54.06) in at least one tension member (member_2) shows high force concentration, likely due to the poor geometric relationship between node_3, the supports, and the internal node_4. member_5 (node_1-node_3) bears considerable force; similar for diagonal connections via node_4. Most cross-sections too small, so truss \'compresses\' stress into minimal material along inefficient load paths. Possible root causes: node_4 too thin, member triangulation under-developed, triangles ‘stretched’, too flat between supports. All nodes are structurally part of the system, no isolation, but the load path is not efficient nor stress within limits. In prior-generation structure (‘constraint_not_met_1’), this did not differ — stresses always over the threshold, implying the topology is simply inadequate for such load unless overconstructed (ie., unacceptably massive).",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Principle: since the heavily loaded joint (node_3) sits between the supports, direct triangulation is needed from both supports toward the loaded joint. node_4, at (3, 1.5), is currently slightly above; if repositioned upwards, triangles could be less flat, improving geometry for force distribution. Additionally, closing the truss (e.g., an extra top chord between the support-adjacent outboard nodes) can afford more redundancy/distribution, reducing individual member stress. Explicitly, making the upper chord more horizontal and perhaps symmetric relative to the span should reduce the induced tensions. More (or judiciously placed) diagonals could help, but need to stay light.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign the structure for a Pratt-like triangulated layout, moving node_4 higher (e.g., y=2.5) for shallower dihedral angles and better load sharing. Add a fifth node (node_5) about 2/3 along the span and raised, forming a nearly equilateral structure of upper chords. Connect node_3 to both node_4 and node_5 (above it), supports to both top nodes, then close the truss via diagonals. Assign thicker areas (area_id=\'3\' or above) to highly stressed diagonals/top chords and use lighter ones for non-critical links. Ensure no floating/isolated nodes, that the truss forms closed load paths (no open polygon sides).",\n\n    "reasoning": "For a downward leftward-angled load, the best force path runs from node_3 simultaneously back toward both supports via multiple triangles. Moving upper (internal) nodes much higher than support link is long enough to create robust diagonals without excessively long/flat sections (which generate larger axial stresses for a given applied load). Explicit triangulation from each support—like in a Warren or Howe geometry—can spread the load efficiently. Closing the path with a top chord (support-to-support via node_4/node_5) will provide redundancy and a true closed section for out-of-plane integrity. Heavily loaded members should get area_id=\'3\' (1.759) or larger; non-critical members get ‘2’ (0.78) or even ‘1’ (0.195). Avoid further increasing the nodes or overly complex topology to retain efficiency.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: \n        - Presume load is transferred mainly along direct triangulated diagonals.\n        - Euler buckling or slenderness not checked as all sections >1.7.\n        - Area_ids: assign \'4\' (3.128) to busiest diagonals if est axial > 12; \'3\' or \'2\' elsewhere.\n        - Member force estimation: By joint equilibrium, ~5–8kN possible diagonal force, if layout is tight.\n        - Node coordinates: \n            - node_1 (0.00, 0.00) pinned\n            - node_2 (6.00, 0.00) roller\n            - node_3 (2.00, 0.00) load/app\n            - node_4 (2.20, 2.50) above node_3 & left center, for sharp triangle\n            - node_5 (4.40, 2.30) above mid-span or rightish, creates longer member for healthier geometry.\n        - All main nodes are part of at least two members, system is closed.\n        - All member lengths estimated for total mass (sum length × area), target <30.\n        - All nodes except node_3,4,5 fixed but shifting 4 & 5 upward/parabolically to provide vertical height, shallower diagonals."\n    ,\n\n    "calculation": "Compute all member lengths:\n    - member_1: node_1 to node_2,    length = 6.0\n    - member_2: node_1 to node_4,    sqrt((2.2-0)^2 + (2.5-0)^2) ≈ 3.33\n    - member_3: node_2 to node_5,    sqrt((6.0-4.4)^2 + (0-2.3)^2) ≈ 2.89\n    - member_4: node_4 to node_5,    sqrt((2.2-4.4)^2 + (2.5-2.3)^2) ≈ 2.21\n    - member_5: node_1 to node_3:    sqrt((2.0-0)^2 + (0-0)^2)=2.0\n    - member_6: node_3-node_2:       sum ((6.0-2)=4)\n    - member_7: node_4-node_3:       sqrt((2.2-2.0)^2 + (2.5-0)^2)=2.50\n    - member_8: node_5-node_3:       sqrt((4.4-2.0)^2 + (2.3-0)^2) ≈ 3.18\n    - member_9: node_4 to node_2,    sqrt((6.0-2.2)^2 + (0-2.5)^2)=~4.46\n    - member_10: node_5 to node_1,   sqrt((4.4)^2+(2.3)^2)=~4.96\n\n    Try assigning area_ids: congested diagonals = \'4\' (3.128), main chords \'2\' (0.782,min weight), mid struts \'2\' (0.782).\n    Constraints: For L=6, cross-sections as above, the total mass\n    = 6.0*0.782 + 3.33*3.128 + 2.89*3.128 + 2.21*0.782 + 2.0*0.782 + 4.0*0.782 + 2.50*3.128 + 3.18*0.782 + 4.46*0.782 + 4.96*0.782\n    Compute:\n      - member_1:\t4.692\n      - member_2:\t10.420\n      - member_3:\t9.038\n      - member_4:\t1.730\n      - member_5:\t1.564\n      - member_6:\t3.128\n      - member_7:\t7.820\n      - member_8:\t2.487\n      - member_9:\t3.488\n      - member_10:\t3.879\n\n    Sum: 4.692 + 10.420 + 9.038 + 1.730 + 1.564 + 3.128 + 7.820 + 2.487 + 3.488 + 3.879 = 48.25 (too high!).\n\n    Reduce area assignments on low-stress ones: Assign main top chord (\'2\'), use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for verticals/less stressed.
