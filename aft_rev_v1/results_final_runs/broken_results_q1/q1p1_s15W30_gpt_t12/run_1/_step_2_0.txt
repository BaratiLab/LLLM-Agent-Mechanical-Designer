The previous designs violated the stress constraint (|stress|=45.33>15) though within mass limits. The goal now is to generate a closed truss, connecting all nodes (including supports and load points), such that the maximum tensile or compressive stress in any member is ≤15, and the total mass does not exceed 30, using available cross sections. Key design priorities: lower member force concentrations and optimize node locations for load paths.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives: (1) Close (fully triangulate) the truss; (2) Reduce highly loaded long members (previous: diagonals, chords overloaded); (3) Respect zero modification policy for nodes with supports/loads. Constraints challenge is stress ≤15 (current worst: -45.33), so drastic force redistribution or area increase needed.",\n\n    "analysis": "The current truss distributes the node_3 (-10 kN at -45 deg) load through adjacent members toward the supports (node_1 pinned, node_2 roller, both at y=0), but member_8 (node_1-node_3) is heavily overloaded, suggesting excessive force concentration. Members use mainly area_id \'1\' or \'2\' (very minimal area), which likely induces high stress in key members, especially in members directly between supports and load points or at acute angles—lack of intermediate bracing/triangulation above node_3 leads to high bar forces. Past historic structures fail similarly when the central node is not adequately braced. A classic solution for loads not directly passed through joints is a Warren or Pratt truss with double or triple triangulation in the upper bay for multiple low-inclined force flows. High forces along node_1 <=> node_3 emphasize the need to add a compression/tension path above, between nodes_4/node_5 or to create more triangles and reroute member forces. Member area can also be increased where forces concentrate.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "High axial force appears along node_3-to-node_1 and node_3-to-node_2. Design history indicates removing or only bracing at node_4 (top) leaves stresses axial |>45|. A solution adds another node centrally (above node_3) and provides additional triangulation, splitting high-force members and distributing force. Extra connection from node_4/node_5 to node_3 will help, but without excessive member length or area. Optimal areas guided by member force and limiting unnecessary excess area elsewhere. Must close the structure — no floating nodes; all must participate.",\n\n    "proposal": "Replace midspan long/concentrated force members (node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3) with more triangulation and even force paths. Introduce one new node (\'node_6\') above node_3 to help distribute the load in two directions. Shift node_4, node_5 upward and outward slightly for better angles in compression members. Increase areas on high-stress diagonals to \'3\' (A=1.759) or above as needed, and keep chords and minor diagonals small (area = \'1\' or \'2\') for mass control. Double diagonal between top nodes to help close force loops. Join every node such that all are part of triangles; the structure is closed.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulating the span from node_1, node_2, node_3, and introducing node_6 just above node_3 (at [2.0, 1.5]) enables shorter, more direct compression/ tension paths for the point load. Splitting the central upper region into two or three triangles allows load at node_3 to flow both toward left (node_1) and right support (node_2), reducing demand on any single member. Keeping node_4, node_5 at approx ([2.25, 2.6], [3.75, 2.6]) creates enough height without excessive member length.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": [\n        "Assume: All bars axial only, truss maintains static equilibrium under single load.",\n        "Load at node_3 = 10 kN at -45 deg: converts to (F_x, F_y) = (+7.07 kN, -7.07 kN).",\n        "Required: Split this load via triangles through node_4/node_6 toward supports.",\n        "Use method-of-joints/sections to estimate maximum bar forces:",\n        "For length & area: member mass = length × area_per_id; target area selection so that: force_per_bar ≤ 15 × area_per_id.",\n        "Select chord areas as area \'1\' (0.195), diagonals as \'3\' (1.759), extra high stressed as \'4\' (3.128), to keep both stresses and mass low.",\n        "Assign topology: node_1-(node_4,node_6,node_3), node_4/node_5-(node_6), node_3-node_6,start with this as Planar Pratt/Warren.",\n        "Calculate member lengths, estimate bracketed forces.",\n        "Estimate total mass; check compliance."\n    ],\n\n    "calculation": [\n        "node_1 [0,0], node_2 [6,0], node_3 [2,0] (all unchanged). node_4: move to [1.5,2.7]; node_5 to [4.5,2.7].
