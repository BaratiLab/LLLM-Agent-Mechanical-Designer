The previous structure exceeded maximum allowable stress (limit ±15) at 54.06 and has a total mass 10.34. Our aim is to minimize stress—keeping all members within ±15—while maintaining total mass under 30, using the given geometry and allowable area_ids.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Interpretation: The initial four-node truss is under-dimensioned for the load case (node_3 with a -10kN, -45° force). Highest stress (54.06) is well above the allowable threshold, causing constraint violation. The sum of the member masses is acceptably low, offering leeway to use larger member areas if necessary. The structure must be \'closed\' (i.e., all nodes inter-connected for load path redundancy).",\n    "analysis": "The load at node_3 (free node, near the supports) induces tension and compression in diagonals/verticals. Reviewing force paths: node_4 provides midspan height (improving depth/stiffness), but heavy stresses on member_2 (likely node_1 to node_4) suggest load path inefficiency or members too small in cross-section. All three supports and load nodes define the truss geometry constraints (cannot move pinned/roller/load nodes). Adding an upper node (node_5) and additional webs improves redundancy and creates multiple, shorter load paths, mitigating localized overstress by increasing vertical presence and triangulation. Some under-used members could be removed, superfluous to load carrying; other member areas upgraded. A minor vertical shift of the central height variables is optimal.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding node_5 above the base (e.g., at mid-span veranda, say (3,2.7)), and distributing midspan/diagonal members optimally can triangulate the structure and relieve the bottom members. The upper structure will more equitably carry the diagonal load directed toward node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Efficient members will be upgraded to meet the demands while weaker ones can get minimum area. Plan to analyze force in key branches and evaluate per allowable stress to size area accordingly.",\n    "proposal": "Redesign the truss for a five-node, double-triangle configuration for a stiff closed-frame response, with members sized for |stress|<15. Add node_5 at top-center. Reallocate the joint at node_4 closer to invited truss shape for reduced moment. Adapt the member plan for maximum triangulation toward load vector, assuring all nodes are utilized and boundary conditions met. Include new diagonal members to split direct high-stress connections.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Double-triangle/trapezoidal plans distribute bracing; forces can take multiple trajectories to supports, stabilizing against large point force. Larger vertical separation (height of top node_5) increases moment-arm and reduces force in bottom chords. Redundant bracing (new diagonals from supports to the top/center) prevents collapse in alternative load resolutions. Larger cross-section members only where absolutely necessary to meet strict mass and stress limits.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume simple statics; use method of joints. For diagonals, calc. force projection: S = F / (A cosθ). Will calculate distances and force triangles. For vertical web, area may be reduced. Use minimal area elsewhere. Plan member list: base (node_1-node_2), two sides (node_1-node_5, node_2-node_5), web diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_2-node_4), new diagonal/chord (node_3-node_5, node_4-node_3, node_2-node_3), etc. Sketch each, compute member lengths for mass equation (mass = length × area), and for each, estimate force and stress to select area_id. Place node_5 at (3.0,2.50) for efficient height. Resolve joint geometry and length using Pythagoras as necessary. Verify all connections are made—structure closed.",\n\n    "calculation": "Set node_4 at (2.35, 1.3) and node_5 at (3.0,2.50) to add top height, calculate updated member lengths:\n        A.
