The current structure is noncompliant (max stress: 42.31, mass: 18.70), so a new layout is necessary that distributes forces more effectively and minimizes peak local stress.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives: Provide a closed truss using precise node coordinates, area_id set, valid connections. Constraints are strict on [-15, 15] for max stress and a gentle upper mass bound. Pinned and roller supports are fixed at ends. Node_3, under significant inclined load, is a probable point for member stress concentration. Current triangle-heavy design creates high stress paths (e.g., member_5: -42.3). Solution requires force path restructuring and potentially moving node_4/new nodes above the direct line between the supports.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Examining the loaded truss: Load of 10kN at node_3 acts at -45°, which means both x and y reactions will be strong at both supports due to horizontal/vertical load components. Critical members, especially those between the load and supports (e.g., node_3 to node_1/node_2), will see excessive compression/tension. The current structure attempts to relieve this by triangulation, but the top chord (member_4 etc.) is too shallow relative to span, leading to high member_5 stress, well above permissible. Member areas show high inefficiency: member_5 has area_id 1 (A=0.195), likely failing due to being undersized for its force. With the existing boundary conditions, a conventional efficient geometry is the Warren or Pratt truss with the loaded node forming an upper apex/tetrahedral regime. Also, node_4 positioned almost above node_3 causes tall/compression-dominated diagonal; moving node_4 slightly outwards and upwards can help lower forces, or adding top and mid-bottom node can improve force pathways. Closing the truss (connecting all lower/upper nodes in loops or with multiple meshes) will distribute stresses.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Major finding: The existing single panel (quadrilateral) is too unstable under this skew load. Likely need explicit horizontal/vertical members and diagonals at lower risk angles, distribute the load. Extending top node further above loaded node could make triangles steeper, lowering individual member stress but possibly increasing mass—still necessary to maintain constraints. Use heavier cross-sections ONLY where stress commands it, lighter otherwise for mass control.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Redesign truss with nodes: retain supports at (0,0) and (6,0), load at (2,0), and keep the current \'upper\' node (node_4), but move it to coordinate (3,2.5) for greater triangulation angle/distance—improving the geometry to reduce acute load path. Introduce a new upper node (node_5: (1,2.2)) above roller support, for additional triangulation and path flexibility, possibly another top node along the span. Members: build a closed perimeter along the new node arrangement, including diagonals from load node to both tops. Assign optimized member areas: stronger where the force path is concentrated by statics, lighter elsewhere, all picked from allowed area_ids. Validate by static calculations/estimated force splits.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation (making top/bottom chords plus well-placed diagonals) is essential; steepening triangle heights above load node disperses forces along more members at shallower angles to load, reducing any individual member\'s axial force. Spreading upper panel (move node_4 to (3,2.5), add node_5 at (1,2.2)), connects properly all 4 corners and provides triangulation for every panel. For straining members (e.g., between load and upper node), allocate larger cross-sections (e.g., area_id 3: 1.759); for side panels or perimeter, lighter members or assign minimally required area. Enough closure to prevent mechanisms.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume: static planar, all pin joints, only axial force, no out-of-plane effects. Estimated Principle: vertical load at node_3 splits diagonally to two upper nodes, which then split support reaction back down to node_1/node_2. Each diagonal force: F = F_load / (2 × sinθ). Raising walker point up above node_3 lessens θ, lowering force (keeping under stress cap). With member lengths (e.g., 2→(3,2.5): sqrt((1)^2+(2.5)^2) ≈ 2.69), assign area from dictionary to get member mass = length × area. Assign area_ids to keep max stress below 15. Total mass must be substantially <30; prior 18.7 is feasible baseline even with higher areas concentrated at diagonals.",\n    \n    "calculation": [\n        "1.
