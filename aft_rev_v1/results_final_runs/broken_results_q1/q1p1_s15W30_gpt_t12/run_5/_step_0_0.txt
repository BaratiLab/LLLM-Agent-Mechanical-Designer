The aim is to design a structurally efficient and fabricable, load-resilient truss with justified cross-sectional areas, achieving equilibrium via triangulation.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_1": "Inputs show nodes forming an open \'V\' (all on x=0 line) with a downward and leftward load at node_3. Supports will allow rotation (‘pinned’—node_1, ‘roller’—node_2). Objective is a minimally stressed closed truss, possibly with a triangle for force-resolution and efficiency.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Node positions: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Loads hit node_3 at -10 kN directed at -45°, giving (Fx≈-7.07, Fy≈-7.07). Pinned support on node_1 (resists x/y), roller on node_2 (resists y). A direct 3-bar triangle (node_1 ↔ node_2 ↔ node_3 ↔ node_1) is minimal, but likely to have high individual member forces. Including a top node above node_3 or splitting the long lower span increases efficiency, aiding triangulation and opening more routes for force diffusion along spatial path (expected with highly inclined resultant load). Failure modes: overstress of tie members, instability if not triangulated.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Direct connection forms a stretched triangle, but because the load at node_3 is at an angle, an added node above node_3 will take better advantage of geometry for both tension/compression and global stability. Crucial to keep mass down with careful area selection. Large spans between supports and loaded nodes are risky for stress. A fourth, apex node (let’s say (2.0, 2.0)), forming two triangles, would effectively spread the load and minimize max member force.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation stabilizes structure and leverages geometry near the loaded node. Placing a node at (2.0, 2.0) above node_3 yields two roughly isosceles triangles. This serves as a virtual ‘king post,’ reducing span between loaded node and supports, shortening levers and lowering stress. Each side of the load is now ‘propped.’ Area selection guided by expected force: main load-near members beefier, tie/bypass ones minimized.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": [\n        "Create four nodes: fixed-end nodes and a new node above node_3 at (2.0, 2.0).",\n        "Connect: (‘node_1’,‘node_3’), (‘node_2’,‘node_3’), (‘node_1’,‘apex’), (‘node_2’,‘apex’), (‘node_3’,‘apex’), and optionally (apex to one support to close all triangles).",\n        "Set up: Member lengths with Pythagoras; member axes from geometry; compute axial forces using method-of-joints or sections (approximate based on load flow); nodes on supports restrain adequately.",\n        "For simplicity: set likely lowest area (‘1’:0.195) for less stressed/non-loaded-straddling ties, increment up for loaded legs.",\n        "Sum up mass (length × area) for each; check member stress with σ=F/A using approx geometry-based forces (load divided per truss branch, then scaled with trigonometric projections)."\n    ],\n    \n    "calculation": " - Node positions: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2.0,2.0). \\n- Member lengths: node_3–apex is 2.0m, node_1–node_3 is 2.0, node_2–node_3 is 4.0, node_1–apex ~2.83, node_2–apex ~4.12.\\n- Member assumptions: Load divides over both top members; vertical reaction at supports handles lower leg.
