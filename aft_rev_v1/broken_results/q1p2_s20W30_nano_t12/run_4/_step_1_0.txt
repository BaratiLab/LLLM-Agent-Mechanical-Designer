Members with small cross-sectional area leading to high stress. Adding more members or changing node positions may reduce stress by more load sharing. Node_4 is above node_3 and node_2 horizontally aligned, but current topology induces high stress at angled members. A triangular load transfer via truss members can help. Consider adding node(s) to improve force path and splitting long members to reduce stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Enhance topology using a higher node above load and connect it to supports to distribute load better.
