Current design stress exceeds ±20 limit at member_2, mass is acceptable at 11.377 < 30.",\n    \n    "analysis": "High compressive stress in member_2 indicates structure weak in tension/compression balance; member_2 area = 0.195 (code \'1\') likely too small. Also, member_1 is relatively compressed at -14.1, near limits. Need reconfiguration for load paths and members to distribute forces better and reduce member length in highest-stress members.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Maintaining nodes 1 and 2 positions supports, but node_3 and node_4 can be repositioned. Load applied down-left at node_3, which lies at (2, 0). Its current position causes high stress on member_2 connecting node_2(6,0) to node_3(2,0). Consider raising node_3 or adding intermediate node(s) to distribute load and reduce high tension in members.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Keep supports at nodes 1 and 2. Move node_3 vertically upwards to near node_4 height, becoming part of a truss via triangle nodes with smaller members. Add one additional node (node_5) between nodes 3 and 2 horizontally spaced to improve load transfer and reduce member length for stress and area optimization. Adjust members accordingly. Assign member areas with higher IDs (≥3) to highly stressed members, moderate for others.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By elevating node_3 closer to node_4 height, force path becomes more triangular, enhancing load transfer efficiency reducing stress in members. Intermediate node_5 on top chord breaks long span into shorter members, lowering max stress. Increasing cross-sectional areas in tension members bearing high load (e.g. from 0.195 to 1.759 or 3.128) balances stress. Smaller areas suffice for compression/low load members to reduce total mass under 30 limit.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Nodes fixed at node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0). New node_3: (2.2, 2.7). Node_4: relocated at (4.4, 2.7) for coincidence with node_5 created at (5, 1.4). Members with lengths recalculated; assign area_id per loading. Members now: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2. Areas: node_3-node_5 and node_1-node_4 = 3 or 4, node_5-node_2 = 2, others 1 or 2.
