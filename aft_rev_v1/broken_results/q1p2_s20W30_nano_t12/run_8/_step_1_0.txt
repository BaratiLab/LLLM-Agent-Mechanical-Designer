Load at node_3, supports fixed at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Nodes 1 and 2 fixed. Node 3 and 4 movable. Need to adjust node 3 or 4 for stress balance and lower max stress.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current max compressive stress is at member_1 (-13.8648) which is near limit -20. Tensile max is at member_4 (7.7199) which is well below 20. Mass is comfortably below limit. Structure is a quadrilateral base (node_1, node_2, node_4 connected forming triangle with node_3 in between node_1 and node_2 edges). Think of moving node_3 vertically upward with node_4 adjustment to redistribute stress reducing peak compression.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adjusting node_3 from (2.0,0) upwards shifts load application higher, increasing force path length potentially reducing stress in horizontal members. Node_4 can be moved slightly horizontally or vertically adjusting triangle shapes affecting force distribution. Keep load and support nodes fixed. Assign sectional areas from given set, keeping currently at \'2\' aka 0.782 area. Possibly decrease area in under-stressed members to reduce weight or increase in high-stress if peak persists.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Since load applied at node_3, increasing its y-coordinate redistributes compressive member forces between node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2. Node_4 controls the upper chord triangulation load paths, slight movement affects tensile and compressive balance. Change member areas only if necessary to reduce mass-stress tradeoff. Current max stress is quite close to 14 rather than 20 so moderate adjustments needed. Aim: move node_3 vertically towards 1.2 to 1.5m and node_4 slightly right from 2.0 to approx 2.3 with small upward from 2.5 to ~2.7, to balance stresses and minimize peak.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node movements: node_3 y from 0.0 to 1.3, node_4 x from 2.0 to 2.3, y from 2.5 to 2.7.
