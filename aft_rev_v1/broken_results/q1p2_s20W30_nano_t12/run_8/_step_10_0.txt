Existing structure’s member_5 max tensile stress exceeds constraint (20.29 > 20). Mass is well below limit (~9.9 < 30). Member areas are small or moderate. Node_4 at (2.9,2.3) leads to unbalanced stress concentrating member_5. Goal: Reduce peak stress on member_5 and member_2. Options are moving node_4 slightly, adjusting member connectivity or member areas for balanced load paths. Currently members_2 and 5 areas are 0.195 (area_id 1). Increasing cross-sections in stressed members or geometric change to improve force distribution, possibly adding a new node for stability and load transfer.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 and member_4 areas of 1.759 (area_id 3) support other members; they can remain. Increase member_5 area from 0.195 to 0.782 might reduce stress but mass is within limit, so increasing it is reasonable. Also possible to reposition node_4 slightly upward and right to improve force distribution and reduce stress on member_5. Another idea is adding a new node (node_5) above node_4 near midpoint between node_3 and node_4 to reduce excessive tension in member_5. However, complexity increases. Instead, refined repositioning might suffice along with increasing area of highly stressed member_5 and member_2.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Reposition node_4 to (3.1, 3.1) to rebalance forces; increase area_id of member_5 and member_2 from \'1\' (0.195) to \'2\' (0.782), keep other members as before with noted areas. This will unload member_5 and member_2 reducing stress and keeping area increments moderate to stay below mass limit. Connect members as before without adding new nodes to keep design simpler and feasible.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Repositioning node_4 higher and to the right shortens member_5 length slightly and improves the angle reducing the tensile force. Increasing area of member_2 and member_5 will reduce stresses directly (stress = Force/Area). Other members have balanced stresses and need not change.
