To make structure closed and stable, connect node_3 to nodes_1 and 2, forming a triangle, creating members: (1-3), (2-3), and base (1-2). Base (1-2) is required. The force on node_3 induces bending and axial forces on members. Need to size areas to keep stress within ±20 units. Area affects both stress and total mass (length*area). Stress = force/cross-sectional area but here force in member derived from static equilibrium and axial force resolution. Smaller area increases stress, but larger area adds mass. Area set chosen must balance.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "All members inline assumed axial force only (axial load truss assumption).

Axial forces in members found through joint method. Assume tension positive. Then, area=force/20 max stress.
