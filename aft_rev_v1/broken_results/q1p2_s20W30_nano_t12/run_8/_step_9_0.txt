Nodes fixed: node_1, node_2 for supports, node_3 load fixed. Node_4 movable. Areas from given set.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress concentrated on member_5 (node_2-node_4) near limit (17.45). Total mass quite low (10.6), capacity to increase thickness. Node_4 currently at (3.22, 2.67). Member 2 (3->2) area is smallest (area_id=1). Stress range across members -7.25 to 17.45. Tensile stress in member_5 high, compression also high in member_2. Adjusting node_4 to reduce tensile in member_5 by changing geometry; also can increase areas on critical members to reduce stress magnitude.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "History shows node_4 rising affects stress distribution. Increasing node_4 x closer to node_2 may reduce stress in member_5. Also can increase area of member_5 slightly within mass budget.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 closer towards node_2 along line y fixed or slightly lowered reduces stress in member_5 tension. Keep node_4 within triangle formed by nodes 1,2,3 for structural stability. Current height 2.67 can reduce somewhat to 2.3-2.5 and shift x to 3.5-3.7 to relieve tension in member_5. Increase area of member_5 from 1 (0.195) to 2 (0.782) or 3 (1.759) to reduce stress. Member_2 under compression possibly can increase area too or member_3 to best equalize stress. All others remain same to keep mass minimal. Node_4 moved: x from 3.22 to 3.6, y from 2.67 to 2.4. Member areas adjusted member_5 (area_id=2), member_2 (keep 1), member_3 (2), member_4 (2), member_1 (3).",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Length calculations for member 5: distance(node_2 to node_4) original approx sqrt((6-3.22)^2 + (0-2.67)^2)=~3.5.
