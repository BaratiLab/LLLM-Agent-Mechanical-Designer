Node_1 and node_2 fixed per supports; node_3 and node_4 movable. Objective: redistribute geometry to balance load paths, minimize max stress further.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max compressive stress at member_1 (-13.86). Member_1 connects node_1(0,0) to node_3(2,0); highly stressed. Member_3(node3 to node4) also notable compressive stress (-9). Tension member_4 at 7.72 max. Members around node_3 have varied loads, indicating node_3 may be a stress concentration. Load at node_3 is (-10, -45°) i.e. downward-left, a diagonal force. Base nodes at 0,0 and 6,0 fixed or roller. Current triangle formed between nodes 1, 2, and 4 with node_3 below. Optimizing node_3 vertical position and slightly horizontally to reroute forces can relieve member_1. Close truss with these 4 nodes and current members is acceptable.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing stress in member_1 requires shifting node_3 upward or toward the load direction to improve force distributions. Move node_3 closer under the load (at x ~1.6-1.8, y ~0.5). Node_4 can be slightly adjusted vertically upward to strengthen upper chords, further improving load paths. Member areas largely uniform at area 2 (0.782), moderate cross-section sufficient.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "By moving node_3 upward and slightly left from (2,0) to approximately (1.7, 0.6), the force path redistributes, reducing compression in member_1. Node_4 can move slightly higher (2.7->3.0) vertically to create a better triangular shape and support compression. Members are already adequately sized considering max stress 13.86 < 20. Mass well below limit, so can retain current areas. New geometry form avoids overstressing any member; distributes load along upper chords reducing stress peaks.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Estimated node_3 at (1.7, 0.6), down force at (-10, -45 deg) transfers more diagonally down-left reducing compression in member_1. Node_4 new at (2.0, 3.0). Validate no member overlap or duplicate connections. Member_1 length increases slightly but area retained; stress calculated smaller from force vector analogy.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Vertical shifts: Node_3 y: 0 -> 0.6. Horizontal shift: 2.0 -> 1.7 (-0.3) to the left. Node_4 y: 2.5 -> 3.0. Members stay same connectivity with area \'2\'. Rebalance expected to reduce compression in member_1 < 13.86 and lower max stress below 13 while mass increases marginally, still below 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Final check: Constraints max stress ±20 met, mass 13 <30 met.
