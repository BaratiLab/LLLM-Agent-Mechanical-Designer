Current max stress 65.59 exceeds allowed. Mass 27.62 close to limit. Load at node_3 with -10 in -45 degree direction. Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Nodes fixed for loads/supports. Aim to respace intermediate nodes and assign appropriate member areas reducing max stresses.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current max tensile/compressive stress occurs in member_6 (node_3-node_1) with -65.59 surpassing ±20 limit. The heavy areas in members 3 and 4 (area 4 each, large masses) still have minor stresses implying inefficient sizing. The geometry places node_5 nearer to node_2 increasing member length and stress in members connected to node_5. Higher area members on longer lengths increase mass. Current structure has chord from node_1 to node_2 with intermediary support nodes (node_3, node_4, node_5) creating several triangular elements. The stabilization and distribution of forces need refinement to reduce peak member stresses. Absence of vertical or more evenly arranged intermediate nodes above line between support nodes."\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress, add one more intermediate node higher up to enhance triangular stability and redistribute forces. Consider lowering member_6 area but next iterations show it was already minimum area allowed (area=1), so redesign layout for better force paths needed. Re-arranging node_5 closer and balanced may avoid large compressive stresses. Redistribution of members and sizing focusing on shorter members with more medium areas optimized for load paths recommended.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add node_6 at position (4.0, 2.8) to improve force distribution. Remove node_5 and replace with node_6 higher up. Connect members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_3-node_6, node_6-node_2, node_4-node_6, node_3-node_1. Assign area ids emphasizing reduced count of large area members. Use areas zero to three mostly, no areas above 4 to control mass. This gives better triangular mesh stability spreading forces with minimal large areas and total mass under 30.",\n\n  "reasoning": "The new node_6 positioned above node_2 better redistributes forces in diagonal members. Removing node_5 reduces member lengths and removes overloaded members. Using areas based on estimated stress demand lowers oversized members thus mass. The pin and roller supports remain unchanged as per constraints. Minimal diagonal lengths reduce stress concentration in compression/tension. This will keep mass close to current limit but reduce max stress below ±20. Smaller closely sized members in optimized layout increases efficiency.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Using node coordinates to compute member lengths and assign areas based on length and stress limitations, aiming for total mass ≤30 and max |stress| ≤20. Anticipate member lengths around 2-3m for diagonals and verticals allowing smaller areas to suffice. Object clear: dynamic sizing + member relocation by node addition/removal to minimize stress and mass simultaneously.",\n\n  "calculation": "Nodes: node_1(0.0,0.0), node_2(6.0,0.0), node_3(2.0,0.0), node_4(2.0,2.4), node_6(4.0,2.8).

With reduced areas, stresses <20 expected per conventional internal force distribution given added support point nodes.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Check no duplicate nodes, connections fine.
