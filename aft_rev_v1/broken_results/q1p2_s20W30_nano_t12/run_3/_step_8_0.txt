Current max stress 112.82, mass 23.65.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure at iteration 7 has member_5 stress 112.82 > 20 limit, and high compressive stress -99.61 on member_4. Member_6 carries high tensile stress 35.21 beyond limit. Mass 23.65 is acceptable but material areas and geometry result in stress violation. The load (-10 units at 45 degrees downward left) mainly applied at node_3 near mid-span requires optimal triangulation and direct force paths to supports. The current design diagonal from node_4 to node_5 and long diagonal from node_1 to node_5 cause stress concentrations.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing excessive stressed diagonals, increase direct load paths with stiffer/more efficient bracing near loaded node. Use smaller area members on less stressed paths, thicker only where needed. Possibly add a node above node_3 to create a symmetrical truss topology avoiding large stress concentration.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node above node_3 (say node_6 at approx x=2.0, y=2.0) creating two triangles: node_1-node_6-node_4 and node_6-node_5-node_2 to better distribute loads. Connect members: node_3-node_6 for vertical support under load, node_4-node_6, node_6-node_5, and maintain node_1-node_4, node_5-node_2. Use thicker area 3 in crucial diagonal chords and smaller areas on chords with less stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Classical stable truss designs with triangulation reduce member stress by direct load transfer paths. By elevating a node above the loaded node (mid-span), forces resolve through short vertical and diagonal members reducing bending and high axial stresses. Assigning member areas reflecting stress experience minimizes weight while controlling maximum stress. Avoid direct long diagonal from node_1 to node_5 which was overstressed. Keeping supports at node_1 \'pinned\' and node_2 \'roller\' allows horizontal displacement at node_2, compensated by stable design.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member areas from 0(1.0), 1(0.195), 2(0.782), 3(1.759), 4(3.128). Target lower mass but no stress beyond 20. Selected thicker chords where forces align with load compression/tension. Removed node_1 to node_5 member to avoid high tensile stress.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Approximate lengths: node_1-node_4 ~2m, node_4-node_6 ~1.1m, node_3-node_6 ~2m vertical, node_6-node_5 ~2.5m, node_5-node_2 ~2m horizontal. Member masses approx = length x area (area mass factor). Total expected mass around 20-25 below 30 limit. Maximum stress expected below 20 due to stable triangles and reduced eccentricities. Stress computation based on load resolving in two inclined and two vertical triangles, spreading the load properly.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "All nodes unique, members consistent, supports and loads unchanged, member size limit respects the set discrete area options.
