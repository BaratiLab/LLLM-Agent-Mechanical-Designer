Given force at node_3 down-left. Supports node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Initial truss stressed over limit: members 3,4,5 with tensile/compressive stress > ±20. Mass 7.38 < 30 ok. Members areas need resizing or topology update needed to reduce stress.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_5 compressive (-36.26) exceeded sample ±20; Member_3 (34.19 tensile) and member_4 (27.03 tensile) exceeded max stress as well. Current layout has node_3 between supports causing high member stresses. Mass low but member areas inefficient. The diagonal members from load node to others carry excessive load. Needs triangular pattern stronger for load at node_3. Reorganize nodes to reduce long members under high load and add a support-like node to reduce spans and stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Could raise node_4 higher or add intermediate node to form a truss with smaller and better aligned force transfer paths. Reconsider area distribution using more efficient heavier cross-section in higher stress members or add more members to carry stress.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node between node_3 and node_4 raised higher vertically at about (2.0, 3.5). Add members connecting node_3 to new node, new node to node_4, and possibly new node to node_1 or node_2. This forms stiffer trusses, reducing member stresses. Resize areas with heavier sections for heavily stressed members near loads/supports, reduce for less stressed. Remove member_2 (node_3-node_2) which has very low area but contributes poorly. Updated member topology to better triangular patterns ensuring transferred load paths.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Higher intermediate node creates steeper load bearing members giving better force distribution, lowering peak stress. Extra members increase redundancy and permit sizing members optimally by stress demand. Removing less effective members reduces unnecessary mass. Area choices follow stress; bigger area for members in highest stress/failure paths to stay within ±20 stress limit. Ideally member force distribution is improved to minimize peaks.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate new member lengths: node_3 to new_node (distance ~1.5), new_node to node_4 (~1.5), etc. Assign high area ~ \'4\' (3.128) or \'5\' (4.887) to members spanning load points. Node coordinates precision for exact load path computations. Member stress estimated via length and expected force distribution after topology change, aiming for <20 stress in magnitude.",\n  \n  "calculation": "1. New node_5 at (2.0, 3.5). 2. Members: M1: node_1-node_3 (keep, area \'2\' or increase), M2: node_3-node_5 (add, area \'4\'), M3: node_5-node_4 (add, area \'4\'), M4: node_4-node_2 (keep, reduce area \'1\'), M5: node_1-node_4 (keep, area \'1\'). Removed member_2. Effects: shorter, stronger diagonals and reduced tension in previously overloaded members. Estimated total mass under 8.5, max stress restricted to below ±20.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Check mass sum( length*area ) < 30 — comfortably met.
