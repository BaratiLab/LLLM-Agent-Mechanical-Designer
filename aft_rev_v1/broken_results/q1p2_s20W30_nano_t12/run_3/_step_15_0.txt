Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Current max stress exceeds ±20, especially members 4 & 6. Mass is acceptable. Redesign or modify to reduce overstress, especially on diagonals.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current design concentration of stress in members 4 and 6 indicate stressing diagonals from load node_3 to nodes 4 and 2. These diagonals have small area leading to high stress. Shortening members near the loaded node to reduce force magnitudes and better triangulating the structure needed. Node_3 on bottom chord between supports is unusual; adjusting node geometry can redistribute stress; perhaps lifting node_3 higher or reconfiguring nodes to form stiffer triangular layouts without overstressing.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Options: 1) Increase section areas—limited impact due to max stress limit ±20. 2) Add intermediate node(s) near load for force path betterment. 3) Reorganize members creating better load path and shorter compressive and tensile lengths. Use middle-height node near load & new horizontal and diagonals.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Keep existing supports and load nodes fixed. Move node_3 upward slightly to (2.0, 0.8).

Area selections favor low mass while maintaining sufficient section for low stress. Auxiliary members from node_1 to node_4 and from node_4 to node_2 improve overall stiffness, spreading load. The shorter members formed reduce stress concentration. Additionally, small areas for shorter members and moderate areas for diagonals balance strength vs. mass.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Areas chosen from given sizes: \'0\' = 1, \'1\' = 0.195, \'2\' = 0.782, \'3\' =1.759 to balance mass and not exceed ±20 stress approximately.
