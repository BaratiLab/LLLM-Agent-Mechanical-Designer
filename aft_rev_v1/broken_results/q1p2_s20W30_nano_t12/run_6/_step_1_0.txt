Current max stress 36.26 > 20, mass 8.56 < 30. Need to reduce stress in member_5 (-36.26) and member_2 (29.05) possibly by redesign or changing topology or areas. Load at node_3 downward-left (-10, -45°). Supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. Allowed to add/move nodes except support/load nodes.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High tensile and compressive stresses indicate poor load path efficiency, especially along member_5 and member_2. Member_5 connects node_3 to node_4; large stress compressive -36.26. Member_2 (node_1 to node_4) tensile 29.05 exceeding tolerance. Member_4 (node_1-node_3) area 0 producing no capacity. Member_6 largest area 2, low stress indicates overstrength - possible area reduction or reallocation. Node_3 mill be supported better to reduce member_5 stress.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Option 1: Add a node near node_3 vertically (x=2.0, y~1.0-1.5) to create a triangular configuration with nodes 1, 2, and new node, reducing long members\' stress. Option 2: increase area on highly stressed members or rearrange connections. Since load/support positions fixed, interior node repositioning is best.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node \'node_5\' at (2.0, 1.5). Connect \'node_3\' to \'node_5\', and \'node_5\' to \'node_4\' and also \'node_5\' to \'node_1\' and \'node_5\' to \'node_2\' to create efficient load paths. Remove member_5 to break stressed member. Resize high stress members with area \'3\' (1.759), others with \'1\'(0.195) or \'2\'(0.782).",\n  \n  "reasoning": "1. Adding intermediate node reduces member lengths and redistributes forces. 2.Help in forming stable geometric truss reducing stress peaks. 3.Less stressed members have smaller areas to reduce mass. 4.Removed member_5 which caused stress violation. 5.Allows load at node_3 to transfer via node_5 nodes towards supports optimally.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths and stresses assuming linear relation and updated topology. Estimated reducing peak member stresses below 20 by area alteration and load path improvement.
