Load at node_3 (-10N, -45°). Supports: pinned node_1, roller node_2. Existing nodes and connections mostly insufficient.",\n  "analysis": "Current design at iteration 6: max_stress=24.51 (member_6 compressive exceeded), total_mass=16.06 good. Stress violation mostly on member_6 (-24.508 > -20 max compressive allowed) which is \'node_3\'-\'node_4\' with area_id=1 (smallest area). Small area induces large stress on this member. Members around load nodes and mid spans critical.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress overrun, increase area on mainly over-stressed members or reroute force path by node reposition or extra nodes to reduce redundant stresses and compressive forces. Mass under limit, slight increase possible for critical members. Minimum area \'0\' (1.0) cannot be used as smaller area suitable for tensile compression but stress limit controlling. Look for better topology to distribute stresses evenly.",\n  "proposal": "Maintain nodes for supports and load; add node near node_4 to split forces; increase area of critical members. Slightly modify vertical level of node_4 to 3.7 to give better leverage. Add new node_6 at (3.0,3.7). Member connectivity to create triangular support path among nodes 4, 5, 6 maintaining diagonal braces between these to redistribute compression better.",\n  "reasoning": "Member \'3\'-\'4\' is currently overstressed, splitting it by a new node decreases member length, reduces stress. Adding members between node_4, node_5, and node_6 provides alternate force paths. Using areas increased to 2 or 3 for load carrying members reduces stress. Members with very low or zero force retain small areas for mass savings.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress approx inversely proportional to cross-sectional area. Length calculation used for member mass estimate. Use area:\n\n\'0\':1, \'1\':0.195, \'2\':0.782, \'3\':1.759,...\n\nmax area 10 (19.548) not economical here due to mass constraint. Conservative area assignments used (2 or 3) for heavily loaded members reduce stress causing member failure. Calculated mass of rough longer members with choice of area 2~3 below 30 total.",\n  "calculation": "New members lengths approx:\n\nnode_3 to node_4 = sqrt((2.5-2)^2 + (3.0-3.7)^2) ~ 0.761\n\nnode_4 to node_6 = sqrt((3.0-2.5)^2 + (3.7-3.7)^2) = 0.5\n\nnode_6 to node_5 = sqrt((4.0-3.0)^2 + (3.0-3.7)^2) ~ 1.220\n\nKeeping critical members at area 3 will reduce stress by factor ~2xs smaller + redistribute compression. Members lengths and chosen areas keep total mass < 28kg estimate.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Nodes: original support and load nodes fixed, add node_6 at (3.0,3.7).
