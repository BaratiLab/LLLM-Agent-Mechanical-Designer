Supports are pinned (node_1) and roller (node_2). Nodes fixed at supports and load. Previous design max stress 1143, exceeds ±20. Mass 20.7, within limit. Stress in member_6 and member_3 excessive. Need redesign to reduce stress and maintain mass < 30.",\n\n    "analysis": "Member_6 (node_2 to node_5) with area \'1\' (0.195) carries huge stress => incorrect sizing or geometry. Similarly, member_3 stress compressive high. To reduce stress, add members to redistribute loads, possibly diagonal members from loads to supports. Also redistribute material focusing areas on high-stress members. Mass is within limit, so some area increase or strategic design is possible. Avoid long yield stress-prone members.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Add a new node closer to the load point at mid-height to form a truss fan: connect load node to supports via shorter diagonals. Use updated node_5 position closer to load and create diagonal members with increased area where necessary. Use area scaling: high stress -> larger area (up to 3.128), low stress -> smaller (around 1 or less). Remove poorly stressed member_6 to avoid stress concentration.",\n\n    "proposal": "Node locations: keep node_1 (0.0,0.0), node_2 (6.0,0.0), node_3 (2.0,0.0) fixed. Move node_4 higher to (2.0, 4.0) adding height to reduce length-heavy compressive stress. Add node_5 at (4.0, 2.5) to create triangular load paths. Members: member_1 between node_1-node_2, member_2 node_1-node_4, member_3 node_2-node_4, member_4 node_3-node_5, member_5 node_5-node_4, member_6 node_2-node_5, member_7 node_1-node_3, member_8 node_3-node_4, member_9 node_5-node_2 to form effective triangular meshes. Assign areas from set: use area \'3\'(1.759) on main compressive/tensile paths and area \'1\'(0.195) on secondary.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Increasing the height and adding well-distributed triangular connections in the load path reduces member forces, especially on inclined members that carry large compression/tension. Adding members connecting load node to higher nodes redistributes and lowers stress. Higher area assignment only to heavily loaded members to keep mass low. Removing or downgrading members with high stress but small lengths reduces the peak stress. This balanced approach reduces max stress below 20 and keeps total mass < 30.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Consider equilibrium with simplified model: Load at node_3 at -45°, shared between members to supports via node_4 and node_5. Member lengths: node_1-node_4=4.0, node_2-node_4 ~5.83, node_2-node_5 ~2.92, node_5-node_4 ~2.5, node_3-node_5 ~2.69, node_1-node_3=2.0, node_1-node_2=6.0. Assign area 1.759 = 3 and 0.195 = 1 accordingly. Anticipate mass sum less than 30 based on length x area approximations.",\n\n    "calculation": "Sum approximate masses: M = Σ(length*area). Estimate: member_1(6*0.782=4.7), member_2(4*1.759=7.0), member_3(5.83*0.782=4.6), member_4(2.69*1.759=4.7), member_5(2.5*1.759=4.4), member_6(2.92*0.195=0.57), member_7(2*0.195=0.39), member_8(3.61*0.195=0.7), member_9(2.92*1.759=5.1). Total ~32.1 slightly above 30, reduce areas of less stressed (e.g. member_9 to \'1\'=0.195) to reduce mass ~25-28. Expected stresses under 20 due to triangular truss with reduced member length and boosted areas. Confirmation by FEM expected.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Proposed design has redundant and stable triangular configuration, increased height for load path efficiency, careful area assignment.
