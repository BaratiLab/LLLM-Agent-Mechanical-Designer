Max stress is 13.86, under the Â±20 limit. Total mass is low at 14.71, well below max 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The max stress occurs on member_1 (-13.86), suggesting high tensile forces on this bottom-span member. Members near the top node_4 (members 2 and 5) experience moderate stresses. Loads apply vertically down-left oblique at node_3, which is free to move but constrained at ends at nodes 1,2. Areas all uniform \'2\' (0.782) may not be optimal; tailoring cross-sections per stress could save mass or reduce stresses. Node_3 position can be adjusted to better resolve force paths and equilibrate stress distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Possibility to shift node_3 slightly upwards and right to relieve stress on member_1. Cross-section of member_1 can be revisited. Closed form must be ensured with connections intact. Supports fixed at node_1 and node_2, cannot move. Members kept same except id and area optimization applied.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Moving node_3 upwards and slightly to the right could result in less axial load on member_1 due to change in geometry better aligned with load path from node_3 (load) to supports. Reducing area of low stress members on top chord while increasing area on bottom members with high compressive or tensile stress may optimize mass/stress. Plan to produce new node_3 at around (2.6, 1.0) to raise it and shift right.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Evaluate new member lengths, reassess stress assuming linear axial forces. Areas assigned by stress magnitude relative to max. Keep areas in discrete scale per constraints. Target max stress ~13 or less. Verify no exceeding mass or stress limits.",\n  \n  "calculation": "New node_3 pos (2.6, 1.05). Member lengths: m1=length(node_1-node_3)=sqrt((2.6-0)^2+(1.05-0)^2)=~2.81, m3=node_1-node_4 unchanged length~4.33, reorganize cross-section: member_1 area=3(1.759), member_2=2(0.782), member_3=1(0.195), member_4=1(0.195), member_5=2(0.782). Expected mass ~sum(length*area). Checking stresses will likely be reduced on member_1 due to shorter, higher area with less force elongation. This improves stress distribution and ensures constraints satisfied.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Ensure load boundary nodes unchanged. Connections preserved.
