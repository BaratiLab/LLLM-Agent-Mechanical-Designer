Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current total mass too high (30.74), stress within limits but closely. Area assignments mostly \'2\' and \'4\'.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current design has too large mass mainly from members with area \'4\' (3.128) leading to total mass slightly over limit. Stress max 13.86 < 20 is feasible. Load transfers from load node_3 to supports through nodes 4 and 5 at 2.5 height, which seems effective. Reducing areas on longer members while keeping stress in limits can reduce mass. Avoid increasing node count unless structurally beneficial. Current node locations mostly fixed except add/move allowed nodes except load/support nodes. Areas 2 (0.782) and 1 (0.195) can reduce mass if stress tolerates.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider reducing areas on members \'member_1\' and \'member_2\' where area=4 (10.0145 mass each). Their stresses are low (1.93, 0.965). They could use lower area to cut mass. Adjusting area of \'member_3\',\'member_4\',\'member_5\',\'member_6\',\'member_7\' properly with direct stress data could fine tune. Keep stable triangular configurations.",\n\n  "proposal": "Decrease cross-section area of members \'member_1\' and \'member_2\' from \'4\' to \'2\' or \'1\' to reduce mass significantly without violating stress. Keep node layout same. Keep other members area as is to control stresses off load path.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Areas correspond directly to member mass linearly; lowering areas halves or third mass. Stress in members \'member_1\' and \'member_2\' are well below max stress, so we can safely reduce their areas. Remaining members with slightly higher stress keep larger areas. This leads to reduced mass under 30 target while maintaining stress within limits. No structural topology or node changes needed as current arrangement favorable.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "mass(member_1 or 2) = length × area_coeff. length approx 3.2016, area coeff=3.128 at \'4\', new area choice could be \'1\' with 0.195 or \'2\' with 0.782. mass_saved ~ (3.128-0.782)*3.2016=7.2 approx per member changing from 4 to 2, total close to needed 1.0 mass reduction. Using area \'2\' safer; reducing both \'member_1\' and \'member_2\' to \'2\' lowers total mass below 30 from 30.74. Remaining members unchanged.",\n\n  "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_4 ~ sqrt((2-0)^2+(2.5-0)^2)=3.2016; same for node_2-node_5 as symmetric.\\nMass old per \'member_1\' or \'member_2\' = length(3.2016)*area(3.128)=10.0145\\nMass new for area \'2\' (0.782) =3.2016*0.782=2.5037\\nMass saving per member ~7.5, for two members ~15 eliminated total mass from 30.74 to ~15.74 + existing ~15 from other members = ~27.74 <30 kg.\\nStresses on \'member_1\' and \'member_2\' were low and can remain under max load with reduced area.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate members or nodes.
