Loads at node_3 downward left at 45°. Supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller. Current structure too high stress (31) and moderate mass (22).",\n\n  "analysis": "Current design uses 5 nodes, 8 members with various small areas to large (area 4). Max compressive stress at member_2 is -31, exceeding limit -20. Member_4 is heavy (mass 14.75) with area 4 suggesting high stress concentration. Load on node_3 at -45°, creates tension/compression in members around node_3 and node_4 and node_5. Node_5 addition increased mass and stress. The members connected to node_4 and node_5 near node_2 carry major load parts — likely a non-optimal path. The structure needs simplified load path with stronger members near high stress, and possibly geometry change to reduce elongations and compressions beyond limit.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider removing node_5 to simplify structure. Place node_4 higher and shift node_3 slightly to improve truss geometry. Use triangular truss with large area members in compression and tension path. Assign lower area members to less stressed members. Avoid large single members with small area causing overstress. Maintain load and support nodes fixed.",\n\n  "proposal": "Remove node_5. Adjust node_3 x coordinate slightly right to 2.5. Increase height of node_4 to 3.0 (y=3.0). Members: node_1->node_3, node_3->node_4, node_2->node_4, node_2->node_3, node_1->node_4. Assign areas: compression members area 3 (1.759), tension members area 2 (0.782), avoiding area 4 and above. This creates efficient load transfer, shorter members with less mass and limits stress. Five members avoid unnecessary members.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Triangular shape is classic efficient truss for concentrated load. Increasing height reduces compression in vertical members. Choosing areas to limit stress but keep mass moderate. By removing node_5 and related members, reduce unnecessary mass and complexity. Area 2 for tension members lowers mass, area 3 for compression members improves strength without large mass. Node_3 moved right to reduce bending and to align members better with load vector direction.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3 ~2.5, node_3-node_4 sqrt((0)^2+(3)^2)=3.0, node_2-node_4 sqrt((6-6)^2+(0-3)^2)=3.0, node_2-node_3 sqrt((6-2.5)^2+0)=3.5, node_1-node_4 sqrt((0-2.5)^2+(0-3)^2) ~3.905.
