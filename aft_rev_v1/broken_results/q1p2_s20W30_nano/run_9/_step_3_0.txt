Max allowed stress is ±20, current max stress 29.05 exceeds limit, total mass 8.7 < 30. Need stress reduction mainly at member_4 (node_1-node_4).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has a tall node_4 (2,3), causing high tensile stress (29.05) in member_4. Members near load transfer are overloaded. The truss shape roughly forms a triangle with node_3 at 2,0 and node_4 above it. Member areas range 1 or 2 (0.782 to 1.759). To reduce max stress, better force flow and load path is needed with a more efficient truss shape and leverage.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding a node to redistribute forces and reduce stress on member_4. Keep load and supports fixed. Use a 5-node trapezoidal shape to reduce stress and create shorter members under tension/compression. Adjust member areas larger only on critical tension members. Minimal mass increase to stay under 30 total mass.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (4.0, 2.0) between node_4 and node_2 to form a trapezoidal shape. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_4-node_2, node_5-node_3, node_1-node_4, node_3-node_5 with areas optimized to reduce stresses and redistribute loads. Use areas mostly 2 or 3 (0.782,1.759,3.128) with larger on inclined members bearing more force. This structure improves force flow from load at node_3 to supports with reduced max stress and still stays below total mass 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "By adding node_5, the force path from node_3 to node_2 goes through node_4 and node_5, dividing members and reducing length and stress on critical members like node_1-node_4. Using higher area members on critical load path reduces stress under bounds. Keeping one horizontal member helps overall stability. Nodes at mid height balance vertical and horizontal forces, aiding in stiffness and stress reduction.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths and areas: Approximate lengths: 1-3 =2m, 3-4=3m, 4-5=2.236m, 5-2=2.236m, 4-2=4m, 5-3=2.828m, 1-4=3.605m, 3-5=2.828m. Areas: critical members with 3 or 4 (1.759 or 3.128). Estimate mass=sum(length * area). Total mass < 30 as areas mostly mid-range. Expected stress reduction by force redistribution and shorter/inclined members.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member masses by length*area approx: m1(2*0.782=1.56), m2(3*0.782=2.346), m3(2.236*1.759=3.93), m4(2.236*1.759=3.93), m5(4*0.195=0.78), m6(2.828*0.782=2.21), m7(3.605*0.195=0.703), m8(2.828*0.195=0.55). Sum ≈16.96 <30. Stress in longer members reduced by added nodes and better load paths. Member_5 area minimal since it\'s horizontal and less loaded. Critical inclined members get medium to large area support.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Design keeps load/support nodes fixed, adds node_5 to reduce stress, no duplicates, precise floats used for node locations.
