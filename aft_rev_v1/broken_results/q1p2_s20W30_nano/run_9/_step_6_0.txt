Current max stress 40.97 >20, mass 27.6 <30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current max tensile/compressive stress is 40.97 > 20 limit on member_8 and member_1 stresses high. Mass is near limit 27.6/30. Structural inefficiency due to overloaded long member_8 (node_5 to node_2) with small area and high stress. Node_6 and member_7 add complexity but do not reduce max stress. Area choices show member_2 area=4 (3.128) is large, member_8 area=1 (0.195) too small for stress. Existing design has multiple intermediate nodes but stress control is poor.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Need to reduce stress in member_8 and member_1, redistribute forces. Possibly remove node_6 to simplify. Increase area of critical members while reducing unnecessary members to save mass. Shorter members reduce force demands. Maintain fixed nodes for load/support.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Simplify nodes to 5 nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2,3.5), node_5(4,1.8). Connect members: member_1: node_1-node_3 area 2 (0.782), member_2: node_3-node_4 area 3 (1.759), member_3: node_4-node_5 area 2 (0.782), member_4: node_5-node_2 area 3 (1.759), member_5: node_3-node_5 area 2 (0.782), member_6: node_4-node_2 area 1 (0.195). Remove node_6 and member_7/8 to reduce complexity and stress concentration. Re-balancing force paths, increased area on tendentious members, smaller areas on compression. Short member_6 from node_4 to node_2 to transfer load."\n\n  "reasoning": "Removing node_6 removes highly stressed member_8. Node_5 repositioned closer to node_2 to shorten members and reduce stresses. Increased area on tension/compression critical paths (member_1, 2, 4) for stress reduction. Using areas per given set within mass constraints. Total length and area product estimated to keep mass under 30. This configuration provides triangular bracing for stability and distributes load paths effectively with minimal members.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths (approx): node_1-node_3=2m, node_3-node_4=3.5m, node_4-node_5≈2.24m ((4-2)^2+(1.8-3.5)^2)^0.5, node_5-node_2=approx 2.28m, node_3-node_5=2.83m, node_4-node_2=4m. Estimated mass = sum length*area_id_area, area * length product ≈ (2*0.782)+(3.5*1.759)+(2.24*0.782)+(2.28*1.759)+(2.83*0.782)+(4*0.195) ≈ 1.56+6.16+1.75+4.01+2.21+0.78=16.47 <30 limit.

Total mass approx 16.5. Max stress should stay ≤ 20 by reduction of long thin members and more triangular bracing with adequate area. Support conditions unchanged.
