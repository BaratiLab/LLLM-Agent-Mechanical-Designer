Stress is the main violation. Stress spikes in members connected directly to loaded node_3 with small area (area 1). The structure lacks load path efficiency and distributes load inadequately. The concentrated load at node_3 requires better triangulation and support load transfer. Introducing a vertical node above node_3 and rearranging members to create more balanced load paths with larger member areas will reduce stress.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Remove member_3 (node_1-node_3) with small area causing overstress. Add a vertical node (node_6) above node_3 (say y=4.0). Connect node_3 to node_6 and node_6 to node_4/node_5, distributing load upwards. Increase member areas on critical load path to \'3\' or \'4\'. Maintain supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Use a triangular framework with node_6 added to redistribute load and reduce stress.",\n\n    "proposal": "Add node_6 at (2.0, 4.0). Remove direct low area members to node_3 from node_1. Connect node_3-node_6 with increased area=3, node_6-node_4 with area=3, node_6-node_5 area=2 or 3. Keep stable base with members node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4 area=3. Maintain diagonal to node_5 to spread forces with area=2. Remove overstressed small-area members at node_3 to reduce stress.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Higher areas at vertical members rising from load node redistribute force vertically and reduce concentrated stress.
