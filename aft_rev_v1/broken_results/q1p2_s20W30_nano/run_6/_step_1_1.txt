Load at node_3 downward-left. Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 at base. Current design has 4 nodes with one load node and two support nodes fixed. Must reduce max stress by adjusting geometry or areas, possibly adding node(s) for better load path.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current max tensile/compressive stress on member_5 (-38.28) exceeds allowable ±20. Member_5 connects node_1 to node_3, directly loaded node. Areas mostly \'1\' or \'2\'. Mass is within limit, so we can use larger cross sections if needed. The geometry is a shallow triangle plus a node at node_3 on base. Load at node_3 is large negative at 45°, generating tension in member_5. Adding a vertical node or repositioning node_4 to better triangulate the load path can reduce high member stress. Member length distribution and area must be optimized. The existing structure links node_4 above node_3, but node_3 is isolated on base line between supports. Increasing vertical height of node_4 and adding a node near node_3 can improve load transfer and reduce stress on critical members.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding node_5 at mid height above node_3 to create stiffer vertical and diagonal members. Adjust node_4 upwards to increase truss height and reduce axial forces. Use larger areas on highly loaded members, lighter areas on others to keep mass in limit. Avoid direct long members under high load; use shorter triangulated members to distribute forces.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (2.0, 1.5) between node_3 and node_4 to create better load path. Raise node_4 to (2.0, 4.0) for greater height. Members: node_1-node_3, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_4. Use area \'4\' (3.128) for main load carrying members and smaller areas for less loaded. Remove members that cause excessive stress (e.g. direct long base members) that are redundant. Retain supports and load node positions per instruction.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing vertical height (node_4 y=4.0 m) reduces axial forces in diagonal members by forming a more effective triangle. Adding node_5 mid-height between node_3 and node_4 provides intermediate support and reduces long member bending or tension. Using moderate to large areas in members near load transfer reduces max stress below 20. Distributing forces with additional node and members reduces peak tension/compression. Mass stays acceptable by optimizing member cross sections. Removing member_6 (node_3-node_2) which was low stressed, replacing with node_5 connections distributes load better. Member areas chosen for balancing mass and stress based on length and axial load paths.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths: node1-node3: 2m, node1-node4: 4m height rise, node2-node4: sqrt(4^2 +4^2)=5.66m, node2-node3: 4m base minus 2 m to node3=4 m, node3-node5: 1.5m, node5-node4: 2.5m. Using area IDs 4–6 for vertical or diagonal load members to keep stress <20. Calculated total mass verifies below 30 with these member areas and lengths. Stress reduction expected from improved geometry and area distribution.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths computed.

Total mass sum approx 51.32 which is above limit 30. Reduce area sizes: use area 2 (0.782) for major diagonals and area 1 or 0 for short members. Adjust: member_2 area 3 (1.759), member_3 area 3 (1.759), member_1 area 2 (0.782), member_4 area 1 (0.195), member_5 area 0 (1), member_6 area 1 (0.195).
