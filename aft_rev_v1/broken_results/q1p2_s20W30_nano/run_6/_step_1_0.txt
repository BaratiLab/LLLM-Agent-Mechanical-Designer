Load: 10kN at node_3 at -45°. Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Current design overstress member_5 (-38.28) exceeding limit.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current design has member_5 severely overstressed, indicates ineffective load path. Member areas 1 and 2 used mostly. Total mass 11.4 well below max 30. Load applied diagonally at node_3 on bottom chord. Need stiffer load path with stressed members ≤ ±20 and possibly better triangulation. Existing node_4 high at y=3.0. Options: add another node at intermediate height for better force distribution, adjust members to reduce member_5 stress. Avoid excessive compression or tension in bottom chord.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce stress on node_3 to node_1 member_5. Possibly move node_4 slightly to improve force angles. Add node between node_3 and node_4 or reposition node_4. Use larger area for low length members in tension/compression. Remove redundant members with low stress. Keep pinned and roller supports unchanged.",\n\n    "proposal": "Add one intermediate node (node_5) between node_3 and node_4 vertically raised to redistribute forces. Reconfigure members to form two triangles: node_1-node_3-node_5 and node_2-node_4-node_5. Use areas 3 and 4 for main compression/tension members. Remove member_6 (node_3-node_2) to reduce redundant force paths increasing stresses. Redesign member_5 area to 4.887 (area_id \'5\') for improved strength.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Primary load at node_3 needs direct triangulated supports to nodes 1 and 4 via node_5 to reduce stress. Separate load paths reduce member_5 tension. Increasing cross section area on critical members reduces stress. Member length and area combination respects total mass. Mass will increase but stay under 30 with area choices. Avoid bottom chord direct compression by adding node_5 elevation.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate new member lengths, estimate stress with action, use area multipliers for mass estimation. Assign node_5 at (2.0,1.8) halfway vertical between node_3 and node_4. Members: node_1-node_3, node_1-node_5, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_2-node_4. Areas: node_1-node_5 = 4 (\'3.128\'), node_5-node_4 = 4, node_1-node_3 = 2 (\'0.782\'), node_3-node_5=3 (\'1.759\'), node_2-node_4=3.",\n\n    "calculation": "Member lengths approx: node_1-node_3 = 2.0m, node_1-node_5 = sqrt((2.0)^2+(1.8)^2)≈2.69m, node_3-node_5=1.8m, node_5-node_4=1.2m, node_2-node_4=3.61m. Areas selected to keep member stresses below ±20. Estimate mass: sum(length×area) ≈ (2×0.782)+(2.69×3.128)+(1.8×1.759)+(1.2×3.128)+(3.61×1.759) ≈ 1.56+8.41+3.17+3.75+6.35= 23.24 <30.
