Current max stress 30.6 > 20 limit in member_3. Mass 15.27 < 30 limit. Need stress reduction mostly at member_3, possibly by adjusting structure and member areas.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current structure: 4 nodes, 5 members; excessive tensile stress (30.6) in member_3 (node_1-node_4) with smallest area \'1\'. Areas for members_1 and 2 are oversized \'3\'. Members 3 and 4 have low area causing stress issues. Member 5 moderate area. Member_3 is highly stressed tensile member connecting support node_1 to elevated node_4 (2.8,3.6). Load at node_3 induces high tension in member_3. Reducing member_3 stress requires improved load path or changing node_4 position to reduce force demand or add intermediate nodes for better force distribution. Adding a node near load to redistribute forces is effective. Additionally, increase member_3 area strategically and reduce oversized areas if possible to maintain mass under 30. Area must remain within allowed sets.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Options: (1) add node between node_1 and node_4 to reduce direct tension; (2) move node_4 slightly right/below to reduce tension; (3) modify member areas: increase member_3 area; reduce others; (4) add diagonal member from node_3 to node_4 or node_5 to distribute forces. Avoid changing support or load nodes positions.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add node_5 near (2.5,2.0) below node_4 to redistribute load from node_3. Modify members: connect node_1-node_5, node_5-node_4 and node_3-node_5. Increase member_3 area to \'2\' or \'3\' for strength. Reduce member_1 and member_2 areas to \'2\'. Maintain members: member_4 (node_2-node_4) area \'1\' (roller support). Remove direct member_3 (node_1-node_4) or reduce area accordingly. Structure now 5 nodes, improved triangular layout for load path.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 near load point redistributes forces from node_3 to node_4 and node_1 through a longer path, reducing stress concentration in member_3. Increasing area of critical members reduces stress. Reducing areas of oversized members reduces mass to stay within limit. Balanced truss with proper diagonals and triangular units optimizes stress distribution. Node placements ensure geometric stability. Supports remain fixed as required.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node positions: node_1:(0,0), node_2:(6,0), node_3:(2,0), node_4:(2.8,3.6), node_5:(2.5,2.0).
