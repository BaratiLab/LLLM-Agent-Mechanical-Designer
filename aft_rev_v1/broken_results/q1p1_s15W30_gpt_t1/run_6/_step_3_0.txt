Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current max stress high at member_5 (-37.63), mass acceptable at 10.4 < 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current max stress exceeds tensile/compressive limit, mainly at member_5. Member_5 too small area (1) for load causing high stress. Member_1 and member_2 areas also too small or uneven. Existing top node_4 placed at (3.0,3.6) relatively high which increases stresses in bottom members. A truss layout with a triangular top node allows stress redistribution. The challenge is to reduce stress in critical members by increasing area or redistributing geometry, keeping total mass < 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing member areas for critical members but avoiding oversized members to stay under mass limit. Possibly add a new intermediate node closer to load point to better distribute forces. Retain pinned and roller supports unchanged. Use precise node locations for optimal force path.",\n\n  "proposal": "Modify geometry by adding one new node higher near load to form a two-tier truss. Adjust member areas for load path efficiency. Areas selected from given discrete set. Keep existing support and load nodes fixed. New node at around (2.5, 4.0). Connect members from node_1 & node_2 to this new node, from node_3 to new node, and add diagonal members accordingly to reduce stress on member_5 and others. Increase member_5 area, and balance other members\' areas to minimize mass while meeting stress.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Adding a new top node distributes load better, reduces stress in bottom chord (node_3). Increasing area of critical members linearly reduces stress. Using areas near 3 to 5 (range 3.128–4.887) balances stress reduction vs mass increase. Triangular shape with central high node is structurally efficient. Avoid very high areas to limit mass. Connect central node to all bottom nodes creating multiple load paths. This reduces max stress below 15. Keeping total mass below 30 verified by member length × area sum.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths for new members, assign areas: critical members ~4, others smaller 2-3.
