Supports at Node 1 (pinned), Node 2 (roller). Current max stress 4.02 within limit but mass 43.62 exceeds 30 max. Need lighter members or reduced lengths. Nodes 1,2,3 fixed; node 4 movable and removable. Current design has redundant thick members increasing mass.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure safe stress-wise but heavy due to thick members on short members. Member mass concentrated on members 1 and 2. Large area \'4\' used on those causing high mass. Members 3,4,5 have area \'3\' (1.759) but combined length also contributes. To reduce mass, reduce area or remove members if possible. Load at node 3 downward-left diagonal, so a direct triangular truss can transfer load efficiently. Node 4 height increased to 4m in iteration 1 to reduce member stresses but increased member length and mass. Better to try simpler triangular truss with thinner members.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider removing node 4 to reduce complexity and length. Use a simple triangle with nodes 1, 2 and 3. Members: 1-3 and 3-2 and 1-2. Use minimal areas for direct load transfer. Check load path from node 3 to supports at node 1 and 2. Node 3 is at x=2, so a direct horizontal member 1-2 is long (6m). Split load with 1-3 and 3-2 shorter members. Possible member areas: 2 or 3. Check feasibility. Simpler design likely lighter and meets stress constraints.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Modify nodes to remove node_4. Keep node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0). Members: member_1: node_1-node_3, member_2: node_3-node_2, member_3: node_1-node_2. Assign areas: members 1 and 2 area \'2\' (0.782), member_3 area \'1\' (0.195). This provides triangular stability with minimum mass. This satisfies nodes fixed condition, simple structure, and reduces mass below 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing node_4 removes vertical longer members reducing mass. Triangular form efficiently distributes forces in axial members. Area selection based on target max stress 15 and load -10N at -45°, moderate member lengths. Cross member (1-2) weakest area to reduce mass as it primarily resists bending moments. Members 1 and 2 slightly bigger area for direct load transfer. Total mass under 30 expected. Member stresses expected well within limits 15. No complicated diagonals or extra nodes to optimize.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: 1-3 = 2m, 3-2 = 4m, 1-2 = 6m. Areas: 0.782, 0.782, 0.195. Mass approx sum(length*area): 2*0.782=1.564 + 4*0.782=3.128 + 6*0.195=1.17 total 5.862 << 30. Stress check: load -10 at 45° = -7.07 vertical and horizontal components.
