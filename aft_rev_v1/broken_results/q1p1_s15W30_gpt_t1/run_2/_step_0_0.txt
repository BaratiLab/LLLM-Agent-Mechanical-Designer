Must form closed truss (all nodes connected), max stress ±15, max mass 30 (length×area sum). Area options given. Need minimal stress truss with these nodes fixed.",\n  "analysis": "Three nodes along x-axis only create a line, so closed truss must add at least one additional node for forming a triangle or quadrilateral. But instructions forbid changing given node positions. So we must add no new nodes; hence, must revisit definition of \'closed\'—all nodes connected and forming a loop with members. Since only 3 nodes, form triangle with members between node_1-node_2, node_2-node_3, and node_3-node_1. Load is at node_3 downward at 45° left. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) prevent rigid body motion. Stress limit ±15. Mass limit 30 from sum length×area. Area choice must be balanced for minimizing stress and mass. Assume all members have length from coordinates, assume linear elastic behavior and equal area for simplicity. Calculate member forces by static equilibrium, check stresses, adjust areas accordingly.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Closed truss: use triangle (node_1, node_2, node_3).

Load\'s x and y components: F=-10N at 45° down-left → Fx = -10*cos45° = -7.07 N, Fy = -10*sin45° = -7.07 N, direction negative x and y. Supports reaction to counteract load. Estimate member forces by method of joints or sections. Assign areas from area options, largest area first to longest member to reduce stress, then smaller for shorter members.",\n  "reasoning": "Assume linear elastic, members only carry axial loads. Calculate support reactions at node_1 and node_2. By static equilibrium: sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, sum moments=0. Calculate member force ranges. Assign largest area to the member carrying highest force to keep stress below 15. Use smaller areas for less stressed members to save mass. Check sum of length×area <=30. Prioritize minimal total mass and stress under 15. With given geometry, triangular truss is simplest closed structure. No new nodes allowed, so geometry fixed.
