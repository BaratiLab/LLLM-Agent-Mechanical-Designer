Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Max stress ±15, max mass 30. Need closed truss (all nodes connected, forming a cycle). Areas from predefined set. Node positions fixed. Single load case.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The three nodes are collinear on the x-axis, forming a degenerate truss line if only connected as is. To form a closed truss, add a new node above the line, creating a triangular truss with the existing nodes plus this new node. Triangular truss yields good stiffness, reduces member stresses via triangulation. Optimize position of new node to minimize member length (thus mass) while maintaining strength under load. Select cross-sectional areas to balance stress ≤15 and mass ≤30. Load at node_3 downward-left (45°), induces tension and compression in members connected there. Node_1 pinned restrains both x and y, node_2 roller restrains y only.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2.7, 3.5) creating members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4 plus existing members node_1-node_2, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3. Use minimal areas on longer members and moderate on short highly stressed ones. Assume member member_1 = node_1-node_4 is mostly tension, node_2-node_4 mostly compression. Approximate member lengths via Euclidean distance. Use static equilibrium for forces, axial force divided by area with allowable stress ±15.

Members: chords at base and diagonals to node_4. Members shaped as a triangle-based truss with complete connection making closed structure (triangle plus base chords). Assign areas selectively: longer members lighter sections, short members moderately thicker to keep stresses low. Simplify stress calculation using P = 10N approx tension/compression. Calculate lengths as sqrt(dx²+dy²). Weigh total mass as sum of (length × area). Optimize areas so total mass <=30 and max stress ≤15.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths in m: L_1-2=6.0, L_1-3=2.0, L_2-3=4.0; New node_4(2.7,3.5); L_1-4=√((2.7-0)²+(3.5-0)²)=√(7.29+12.25)=√19.54=4.42; L_2-4=√((2.7-6)²+3.5²)=√(11.0+12.25)=√23.25=4.82; L_3-4=√((2.7-2)²+(3.5-0)²)=√(0.49+12.25)=√12.74=3.57m.
