Supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller. Max stress ±15 and mass ≤30. Area sets range 0.195 to 19.548. Need a closed truss: all nodes connected and forming loops. Don’t move nodes 1, 2, 3. Choose member connections and areas to minimize stresses under load and mass constraints.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The truss is on a horizontal baseline between (0,0), (6,0), and (2,0). Load is downward and horizontal at 45° on the middle node. The structure lacks vertical height nodes - so consider adding a fourth node above node_3 to form a triangle (closed shape) providing stability and better stress distribution. This extra node breaks line colinearity, reduces bending moments, saves stress, potentially reduces area and warning mass. Members should connect all four nodes to form at least two triangles. Assign areas based on approximate stress estimates using axial forces. Use static equilibrium and truss structures to allocate areas.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 above node_3 for vertical depth at around x=2.0, y positive. Connect node_4 with node_1, node_2, and node_3 to create triangles. Member count: node1-3, 2-3, 1-2 already exist potentially. Add 3-4, 1-4, 2-4 members. Estimate member lengths by distance formula. Assume axial force in members by static equilibrium. Select areas so calculated stress = Force/Area ≤ 15 . Check mass = sum(length * area) ≤ 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Truss stability demands closed loops for load distribution. The load at 2,0 downward at -45° means members "above" should resist tension and compression. With node_4 roughly 2.0 up from 2.0,0 gives an equilibrium triangle. Members connecting node_4 to base nodes split forces effectively. For stress, smaller max allowable stress 15 limits minimal section area. Heavier areas increase mass and must be balanced. Geometry changes improve stress distribution. Using truss equilibrium, total vertical reaction at supports sums load vertical component. Node positions fixed for existing nodes, only new node_4 introduced. Member areas 0.195 and 0.782 appropriate for small forces; heavier loaded members can use larger areas. Sum of length*area must stay ≤ 30 to respect mass constraint.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumed members: [1-2 baseline], [1-3 left diagonal], [3-2 right diagonal], [3-4 vertical/up], [1-4], [2-4].

Approx force guesses: members connecting node_4 resist tension, node_1,2 resist reaction. Assign larger areas on heavier load members (e.g. 3-4 and 1-3), smaller on base members 1-2, 2-3 to limit mass. Calculate mass=sum(length*area_id).
