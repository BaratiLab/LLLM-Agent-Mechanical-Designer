To ensure closure, connect nodes as triangle plus consider adding a strategically placed 4th node above or below line for closure. However, input forbids changing node positions, so add no new nodes. Closure so use the three nodes in triangle by adding member_3-1, member_1-2, and member_2-3. All three sides form a triangle closure. Select member areas balancing mass and max stress constraints.
