Load at node_3 (-10k at -45°). Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Current max stress 24.9 > 15 with total mass 19.43 < 30.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current design has one highly stressed member (member_8) at 24.9 > 15; this member (node_1 - node_6) uses smallest area but still is over stress limit. Mass is acceptable but stress constraint violated. Node_6 near node_3 with connecting members raises tension, causing over-stress. Many members use small areas making some overstressed. Structure topology is extended from supports and loaded node up through intermediate nodes 6 and 7 to distributed load transfer. Current max stress occurs near support node_1 so load path from node_3 to node_1 must be strengthened. Adding or repositioning nodes near load or critical links can provide alternate load path and reduce stresses in elements. Member areas must be upgraded in highly stressed members, reduce area on low-stress ones if needed to stay under mass limit. Avoid bending moments by triangular stable arrangements. Connections over longer lengths increase area and mass, so node positioning is crucial.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Key stress-critical path: node_3↔node_6↔node_1, especially member_8. Let\'s move node_6 upwards and closer to node_1, and add one node near load node_3 to create stiff triangles to spread loads. Upgrade area sizes for critical members. Ensure not to exceed mass. Plan fewer high-area members by efficient load path.",\n\n    "proposal": "Keep fixed nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Add node_6 at (1.3,1.7) closer to supports, node_7 at (3.5,3.5), remove node_7 (old at 2.8,3.0) and define simpler stiff triangles node_3-node_6-node_1, node_6-node_7-node_5-node_2 connectivity with revised members. Select higher area members directly in high load path and smaller where low stress is expected.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Moving node_6 upward and closer to support reduces length times moments in bottom chord member_8 (node_1-node_6). This shortens critical members and breaks stress concentration. Introduce node_7 midway top side to create triangles among load node_5 (3,4.5), adjacent nodes and supports, reducing member length and distributing forces. This splits load path and reduces stress. Upgrade critical members area_ids from lower values to 4 or 5 where stress needs reduction, and keep mid-member areas at 2 or 3 for lighter paths. Keeping adjacent triangles reduces bending. Final check on member selection for minimal mass to satisfy constraints.", \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Start estimating lengths (hypotenuse between points). node_1-node_6 length ~ sqrt(1.3²+1.7²)=2.15m; node_6-node_7 = around sqrt((3.5-1.3)²+(3.5-1.7)²)=3m; node_3-node_6= sqrt( (2-1.3)²+ (0-1.7)² )=1.83,.
