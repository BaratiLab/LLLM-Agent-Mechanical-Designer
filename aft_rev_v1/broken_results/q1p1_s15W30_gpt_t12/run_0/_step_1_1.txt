Total mass 18.57 < 30 allowed. Load is -10 at 45°. Members around node_3 must resist high compressive stress. Current member_1 area 0.195 is too small for the compressive load.",\n\n    "analysis": "The main issue is member_1 overly stressed in compression (-60.44 Pa). Current design under safe mass but stress fails. Member_1 is short between node_1(0,0) and node_3(2,0). Member_3 and member_4 have large section (area id 3), carry less stress. Node_4 placed at (3,3) helps triangular bracing but not enough to reduce compression at member_1. Existing load at node_3 pulls down-left; compression in member_1 is caused by horizontal reaction forces. To reduce stress, increase area of member_1 and adjust nodal positions to optimize load path, possibly raising node_3 vertically or adding intermediate node to reduce load on member_1. Adding/relocating intermediate nodes for better geometry might help. Since node_1, node_2, and node_3 are fixed positions per instructions (node_3 is load node can\'t move), only node_4 can be moved or a new node introduced.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Raising node_4 higher than 3 to provide better load path needed. Possibly move node_4 upward (e.g. y=4~4.5) and repositionally connect with node_3 to distribute stress better. Increase member_1 cross-section to higher area id. Consider adding node_5 above node_3 to split forces and reduce compression load in member_1.",\n\n    "proposal": "Maintain nodes 1,2,3 fixed. Move node_4 upward to (3.0,4.5). Add new node_5 at (2.0,2.7) above node_3 to add a vertical support link.

This geometry forms more triangles, reducing compression in member_1 and equalizing load paths.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Increasing the height of node_4 to 4.5 improves the vertical stiffness, redistributing forces in the truss. Adding node_5 above node_3 forms additional load path members (node_5-node_3 and node_4-node_5), mitigating excessive compression at member_1. Member cross-sections chosen to meet ±15 stress and keep mass under 30. Areas selected from lookup to balance weight and strength. Used larger sections (area 4:3.128) on diagonal load-bearing members, moderate sections (area 2:0.782, area 3:1.759) on secondary load paths.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Member length calculated with distance formula.
