Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Constraints require max stress ±15 and total mass ≤30. Current design has mass=43.11 and stress max=8.83 but exceeds mass constraint.",\n  "analysis": "Current structure node placement seems reasonable with nodes fixed at supports and load. Stress levels are acceptable, but total mass is significantly over limit, mainly due to large member areas and/or lengths. Large mass concentrates on members 3,4. Member areas need reduction and geometric changes to balance forces efficiently, reduce redundant members, and decrease mass. Additional nodes may help distribute load and reduce individual member length. Removing or reducing member_3 and member_4 areas needed.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Reduce length and area of heavy members. Introduce top bracing node near load (around y=2.0-2.5) to share stresses and allow smaller members. Optimize member layout to avoid member_6 and member_7 large areas leading to mass and stress build-up. Potentially remove redundant diagonal member_6 (node_1-node_4). Use smaller area IDs for longer members and allow tension/compression balanced arrangements.",\n  "proposal": "Add additional node to better triangulate load: node_6 near mid-span/load at (2.7, 2.1). Update members connecting from node_3 and node_5 to node_6, and from node_6 to node_4. Remove member_6 (node_1-node_4). Adjust member_3 and member_4 area IDs to 2. Lower areas on some members from 3 or 4 to 1 or 2 to reduce mass. Reconnect members to form favorable load path: node_1 to node_3 (area 2), node_3 to node_6 (area 1), node_6 to node_4 (area 1), node_4 to node_2 (area 1), node_3 to node_5 (area 2), node_5 to node_2 (area 2), node_1 to node_5 (area 1), node_5 to node_6 (area 1). Remove member_6. This will reduce mass and maintain stress within limits.",\n  "reasoning": "Removing the direct diagonal member (node_1 to node_4) which carries significant mass and stress and replacing it with a triangulated layout incorporating node_6 redistributes load with shorter members, enabling smaller cross sections. Reducing area indices on longest members decreases total mass markedly. Keeping nodes fixed at supports and load ensures problem constraints are met. Introducing node_6 aligns with effective truss topologies and avoids secondary moment loads. Area mappings lead to mass reduction. Expected max stress remains ≤15 due to better force paths. The total mass will reduce below 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Length calculations: nodes around (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), (3.72, 3.4), (2.7,1.1), (2.7,2.1). Use lengths × area indices for mass estimate. Check area dict values: ID 1=0.195, 2=0.782, 3=1.759, 4=3.128 etc. Aim for members mostly area 1 and 2, possibly some 3. Prior large areas 4 and 0 (1) reduced.
