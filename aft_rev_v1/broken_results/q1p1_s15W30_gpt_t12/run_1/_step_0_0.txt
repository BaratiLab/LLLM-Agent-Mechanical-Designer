Load applied downward-left at node_3. Form a closed truss by adding members connecting existing nodes, ensuring no duplicates, selecting proper member areas to minimize stress and mass.",\n  \n  "analysis": "With 3 nodes fixed at (0,0), (6,0), and (2,0) all colinear, the structure is currently a line, not a closed truss. Closed means all nodes inter-connected forming at least one triangle or polygon. To ensure closure, a node above the line is needed or diagonals. Introducing node_4 overhead to form a triangle is impossible as not allowed by user constraints. So checking adding connections among node_3 and node_1 and node_2 sufficiently forming a triangle: but node_1 & node_2 are at base, node_3 at (2,0) colinear. That produces zero area triangle. We must only connect given 3 nodes, no new nodes—so closed means in this context, all nodes connected mutually. Add members (node_1-node_3), (node_2-node_3), (node_1-node_2) - this forms a rigid triangular truss in a linear shape but still closed in terms of connectivity. Under load at node_3, members carrying tension and compression can be balanced using area selection avoiding overstress while minimizing mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "No additional nodes → closed truss means triangle formed by edges (1-2), (2-3), (3-1). Calculate member lengths: member (1-2)=6m, (1-3)=2m, (2-3)=4m. Load is 10 N at -45°, resolve loads into X and Y components. Supports pinned and roller provide reactions for static equilibrium. From force equilibrium and assumed member forces, approximate stresses assuming uniform cross-section area in each member. Adjust cross sections from available areas to keep stresses within ±15 units while total mass (sum length × area) ≤ 30. Prioritize smaller areas for longer members due to mass effect unless stress demands larger cross-sections.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Members (1-2), (1-3), (2-3) create a triangular truss inherently stable. Load on node_3: resolve force (magnitude -10, angle -45°) into components Fx = -10*cos(45°)= -7.07 N, Fy = -10*sin(45°)= -7.07 N downward and left. Support at node_1 pinned restrains both X,Y. Node_2 roller restrains vertical only. Reactions calculated via equilibrium equations. Member forces assumed axial. Selecting areas to satisfy stress constraint (force = stress × area) and mass constraint (length × area).
