Areas need suitable sizing and better load path.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Extreme stress in members linked to node_7 and node_6 suggests this sub-truss addition is ineffective. High compressive stress (member_9) and tensile (member_8/7) exceed limits >100 times. Mass slightly above 30 (30.56) but mainly site corrective action on stress. Prior simpler designs with fewer nodes reduced mass but failed stress tests. Need more triangular bracing to distribute stresses within limits. Area sizes too small in critical members.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_7 to eliminate stress concentration. Adjust node_6 vertically to optimize force flow. Provide full triangulation between supports and load node_3 passing through node_4 and node_6 with self-stabilizing topology.
