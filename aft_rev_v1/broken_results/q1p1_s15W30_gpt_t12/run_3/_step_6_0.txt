Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Previous structure stresses exceeded constraints. Max stress -39.4 on member_4, mass 16.44 < 30 but high stress fails. Areas used: mostly 1,3. Design must reduce max stress and maintain or reduce mass.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design uses four members with some fabric members under excessive compressive stress (-39.4). Boundary nodes cannot change; node_4 mass center is high but stress on member_4 (node_1->node_3) is critical. Need to add bracing or redistribute forces. Also, member 1 mass is very high (area 3) but zero stress implies oversized member. Potential optimization: reduce oversized members, add a new truss node to balance forces and reduce high stresses in main chords.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Hypothesis: Add one or two nodes above node_3 in web to form a more efficient load path. Increase area in tension/compression along primary diagonals and lower areas in others to reduce mass. Remove member_4 or reduce its area since it has high compressive stress.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add one new node (node_5) above node_3 around (2.5, 3.8) to form upper web. Modify members: connect node_1 to node_5, node_5 to node_3, node_5 to node_4, node_3 to node_2 remain. Reduce area in highly stressed member_4 by removing or replacing with new members through node_5. Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 support & load nodes fixed.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 redistributes high compressive demand on member_4 by redirecting forces into nodes 4 and 5 webs, lowering max stress values below 15 absolute. Using area ids: larger 3 or 4 sections on key diagonals to handle stress, low areas 1 or 2 on shorter members. Removing direct node_1-node_3 (member_4) completely avoids high compressive stress. Tight perimeter members maintain geometry and load transfer.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node positions: node_5 around x=2.5, y=3.8 (just beyond node_4\'s y=3.75).
