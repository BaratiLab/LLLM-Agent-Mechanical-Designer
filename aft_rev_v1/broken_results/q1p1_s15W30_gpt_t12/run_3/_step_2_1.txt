Supports: pinned (node_1), roller (node_2).",\n\n    "analysis": "Current design (iteration 1) fails stress constraint (max ~56.46 > 15) and mass exceeds (44.9 > 30). Large mass member areas for longer links cause this. Current nodes: fixed supports and loads fixed at x=0,6,2; added top nodes (node_4 at 3.0,3.0; node_5 at 2,5) for stiffness but mass is high. Stress in member_4 very high compressive (~-56.5), indicating load path issue through node_3 to node_2.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "stresses too high, long members with large area cause high mass and stress. Need simpler, lighter topology with better triangulation and optimized member areas.",\n\n    "proposal": "Remove node_5 to reduce complexity and mass; add node, node_4, higher and correct positioned for good load transfer; assign smaller cross sectional areas. Link supports and load node with an efficient triangular truss form preserving stiffness but with reduced mass and limited member areas to meet stress limits. Use nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0 - load), new node_4 at about (3.5, 3.5). Member connections: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_4-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_3. Assign areas from smaller allowed values carefully targeting limits.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Removing node_5 reduces member lengths and complexity. Node_4 creates symmetrical truss triangle to distribute load efficiently from node_3 load to supports at node_1 and node_2. Using smaller cross-sectional areas where possible reduces mass. Assign smallest (area_id=1 or 2) to tension members, slightly larger (up to 4) for compression or critical members. The top node shifted moderately rightwards increase member angles for better force transfer and lower axial force magnitude. The rectangular geometry Thrust triangle with minor right triangle formations enhances stiffness and reduces internal stress norms.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Use members lengths from new node positions; estimate areas from available set so that sum_of(length*area) < 30; max stress <= ±15 by force redistribution.
