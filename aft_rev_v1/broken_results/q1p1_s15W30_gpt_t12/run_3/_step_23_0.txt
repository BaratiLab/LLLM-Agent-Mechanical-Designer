Load at node_3, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller).",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_1": "Maximum stress is hugely exceeded (±1170 vs ±15). Total mass 24.23 < 30, so mass is acceptable. Need to reduce member stresses drastically. High compressive stress in member_6 (node_6-node_1), tensile on member_1. Current nodes mostly align low with height ~3.5 max. Load is downward and left at node_3, which is supported mid-span. Distributing load better with stiffer triangulation and avoiding long slender highly loaded members is needed. Areas mostly small (0.195 to 1.759). Increase redundancy and add tension-compression balanced members. Avoid direct long members at small areas in heavily stressed members. Avoid relocating load/support nodes. Introduce intermediary nodes to split forces. Design should keep light mass but significantly reduce stress."\n\n  "analysis": "Current design has heavy over-stressing especially at members connected to node_6 (new intermediary node), mostly under compression. Member_6 stresses of -1170 shows a buckling or under capacity issue. Suggest replacing node_6 position downward to increase effective height and redistribute forces. Currently node_6 is at (2.2,2.3) forming these long compressive-heavy members. Changing geometry and member sizes to balance axial forces and ensuring pin-jointed triangular bracing can achieve stress limits. Use thicker profiles for short members holding big loads. Use thinner profiles for low force long members. Add diagonal members to share load. The tension on member_1 implies pulling away from support, so remove some direct long compression lows before it buckles too much."\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Small mass headroom of ~6 before hitting 30 mass max. Priority is stress reduction by changing node_6 location and member connections, favor thicker members with shorter spans in compression. Try a 3-node upper truss between nodes 1-4-5-2 with node_6 closer to node_3 but lower height to share compressive force path. Maintain essential load path from node_3 to supports with multiple triangular frames."\n\n  "proposal": {\n    "node_dict": {\n        "node_1": [0.0, 0.0],\n        "node_2": [6.0, 0.0],\n        "node_3": [2.0, 0.0],\n        "node_4": [3.2, 3.8],          \n        "node_5": [4.8, 3.2],\n        "node_6": [2.5, 1.4]           \n    },\n    "member_dict": {\n        "member_1": ["node_1", "node_4", "4"],  \n        "member_2": ["node_4", "node_5", "3"],\n        "member_3": ["node_5", "node_2", "3"],\n        "member_4": ["node_4", "node_6", "3"],   \n        "member_5": ["node_6", "node_3", "3"],\n        "member_6": ["node_6", "node_1", "3"],\n        "member_7": ["node_6", "node_2", "3"],\n        "member_8": ["node_1", "node_3", "1"],   \n        "member_9": ["node_3", "node_5", "1"],   \n        "member_10": ["node_3", "node_4", "2"]   \n    }\n  },\n\n  "reasoning": "Raising node_4 slightly to 3.8 (from 3.5) and repositioning node_5 to 4.8, 3.2 creates more ideal triangle shapes improving load distribution.

Assign areas 3 to all critical compressive members adjacent to node_6 to avoid buckling (> area_id \'3\' = 1.759) while using smaller profile for less compressed members on long spans (areas 1 or 2). Added member (node_3-node_4) as diagonal brace with lower area (2) to stabilize member forces in upper truss. Node 3 stays fixed for load, nodes 1 and 2 fixed supports.
