Constraints: max |stress| ≤ 15, mass ≤ 30.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Load on node_3 diagonally downward left. Supports fixed as pinned and roller at nodes 1 & 2; node_3 fixed by load and cannot move. Current max stress and members have major violations; member_6 with extreme compressive stress (-1170). Mass under limit but stress grossly exceeds. Current members over-sized or stress concentrations.",\n  \n    "analysis": "Severe compressive stress in member_6 (node_6-node_1) suggests too small cross-section or poor geometry/stiffness. Need stiffer load path to support inclined load at node_3. Member 6 area = \'1\' = 0.195 too small, but increasing area adds mass, risking limit. Also long diagonal members with high internal forces. Consider relocating internal node_6 upwards or shifting nodes / adding new intermediate node to redistribute load better into pinned and roller supports. Triangulation needed to reduce moment effects.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding node near vertical projection from node_3 towards node_4 and adjusting connectivity can form stable triangular substructures. Aim to reduce member_6 length and stress. Possibly adding a new node (node_7) near (2.2, 2.7) to split member_6 and nearby ones. Trade-off is extra node and members, but can reduce max stress significantly and fit areas into lowest cross sections within allowable stress limits.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Add node_7 at (2.2, 2.7). Connect node_7 to node_1, node_3, and node_6. Update member areas for better stress distribution using smaller area indices where forces are low and moderate indices along primary load paths. Remove highly stressed current member_6, split tension/compression loads into smaller members. Optimize member connections: members between node_1/node_7, node_7/node_3, node_7/node_6, node_6/node_4, node_4/node_5, node_5/node_2, and diagonal node_3/node_5. Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed;",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulated layouts reduce bending and excessive stress; placing intermediate node reduces length of heavily stressed member_6 and distributes load on more members with moderate cross-section areas within allowed mass and stress. Target stresses <15, preferably <10 margin. Use areas from 0.195 to 1.759 depending on stress demand from shorter members. Shift load paths for less eccentricity. Avoid direct long members that cannot carry such large compressive stress.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculations for member length and forces: approximate member stresses assume axial loads proportional to lengths and load components, reduce length of node_6-node_1 by splitting into node_6-node_7 and node_7-node_1, leverage triangle 1-4-7 and 3-7-6 for load transmission.
