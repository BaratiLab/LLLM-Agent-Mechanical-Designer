Current design overweight and overstressed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure added node_5 high, increased mass and stresses didn\'t meet constraints. Member stresses peak -56 to 25 vs allowed ±15; total mass 44.9 >30. Forced areas big especially on long members resulting in too much mass. Member 4 highly stressed in compression indicating load path inefficiency.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce oversized members, adjust geometry to direct loads in simpler triangular topology. Reduce vertical height to lessen long member mass. Reduce number of members or assign smaller area section along low stress members.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove extraneous node_5, reposition node_4 lower and relocate node_3 slightly right to form stable triangular frame. Use minimal allowed cross sections on compression members and slightly larger on tension members to balance stresses and mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Single load mostly downward-left transferred through node_3. By forming a triangle between pin (node_1 at origin), roller (node_2 at (6,0)) and load node_3 slightly above the baseline, the truss can balance the force with fewer members and less mass. Each member length and section area chosen to keep stress within limits ±15. Triangular frame inherently stable in 2D with pinned and roller points provides efficient load transfer. Using minimum adequate areas reduces mass to within limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Positions: keep node_1 and node_2 fixed, move node_3 to approx (3.5,1.5). Members: node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_2 all needed. Assign area 2 or 3 to longer compression members and area 1 or 0 to shorter/tension. Calculate member lengths for mass sum: e.g. length(node_1-node_3) ~ 3.9, area 3 => 3.9*1.759=6.86, similarly for others to keep total mass under 30. Check stress ratios proportional to load components, adjust area if stress magnitude exceeds 15",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node positions: node_1= (0.0,0.0), node_2= (6.0,0.0), node_3= (3.5,1.5).

Assign areas: member_1 and member_2 area_id=3(1.759), member_3 area_id=1(0.195). Estimated total mass=3.54*1.759*2 + 6.0*0.195 = 12.44 + 1.17 = 13.6 <30. Expected axial stresses balanced under inclination and reduced section size to ±15 limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Simple triangular frame with minimal members achieves stability, load transfer with low mass and stress under limits.
