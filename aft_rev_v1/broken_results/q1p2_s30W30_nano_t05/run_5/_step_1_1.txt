Total mass 19.18 < 30 max. Load at node_3 downward-left. Supports fixed at nodes 1 and 2. Node_3 can move horizontally only, node_4 can move freely to optimize geometry.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max compressive stress at member_1 (-28.78) is critical. Member_1 is from node_1(0,0) to node_3(2,0) with smallest area 0.195. Member_6 (node_3 to node_4) has largest area 1.759 and low stress. Members 4 and 5 (node_1 to node_4 and node_4 to node_2) have areas 0.782 and moderate stress. Member_3 (node_1 to node_2) has large area 1 and low stress. Load at node_3 causes high compression in member_1. Moving node_3 horizontally closer to node_1 or node_4 may reduce stress in member_1. Adjust node_4 position to reduce bending and stress concentration. Possibly reduce area in low-stress members to reduce mass or redistribute areas to critical members.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try shifting node_3 closer to node_1 to reduce member_1 length and compressive stress. Move node_4 slightly right and down to make triangle more equilateral and distribute forces evenly. Adjust member areas: increase area in member_1 to reduce stress, reduce areas in low stress members to save mass. Check mass after area changes.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Reducing length of highly stressed member_1 reduces stress. Moving node_3 left from 2.0 to ~1.2 reduces compression. Moving node_4 right from 2.0 to ~3.0 and down from 3.0 to ~2.0 improves force distribution. Area of member_1 can be increased from 0.195 to 0.782 or 1 to reduce stress. Areas of members with low stress (member_6) can be reduced to save mass. Ensure total mass < 30 and max stress < 30.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculations: member_1 length ~ distance(node_1 to node_3) = |x3 - 0|. Reducing x3 from 2.0 to 1.2 reduces length by 40%. Member_4 and member_5 lengths adjusted by moving node_4. Areas: member_1 from \'1\' (0.195) to \'2\' (0.782) or \'0\' (1). Member_6 area reduced from \'3\' (1.759) to \'1\' (0.195). Calculate mass = sum(length * area). Check stress proportional to load / area.
