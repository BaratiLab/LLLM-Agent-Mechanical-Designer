Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_3 can move vertically only to reduce stress. Members have mixed areas; largest stress in member_1 (-28.78).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_1 is highly stressed in compression (-28.78). Member_3 has low stress (-4.60) but large mass (6). Members 4,5,6 moderate stress and mass. Load at node_3 (-10, -45 deg) implies vertical and horizontal components causing bending. Node_3 is currently on bottom chord at (2,0). Elevating node_3 vertically should reduce bending and compressive stress in member_1 by distributing load better. Also, member_3 area can be reduced to lower mass if stress is low. Member_6 area is largest (3), can be optimized as well. The structure is a trapezoid with a diagonal member_6. Moving node_3 up slightly to form more of a triangle with node_1 and node_4 could reduce stress in member_1. Check if member lengths and areas keep mass < 30 and stresses within ±30.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try moving node_3 from (2.0,0.0) to (2.0,1.0) or (2.0,1.5). Reduce member_3 area from \'0\' (1) to \'1\' (0.195) if stress allows. Adjust member_6 area from \'3\' (1.759) to \'2\' (0.782) if stress is low. Check stress in member_1 after moving node_3. Maintain node_1 and node_2 fixed due to supports and loads.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Raising node_3 will reduce axial compression in member_1 by changing force distribution. Smaller areas on low-stress members reduce mass. Member_3 is currently area \'0\' (1), large mass. If stress is low, area can be reduced. Member_6 area can be reduced similarly. Member_4 and 5 moderate stress, keep area \'2\' (0.782) or increase if needed. Member_2 area \'1\' (0.195) is low, acceptable as stress is low (7.49). Member_3 can be reduced if stress low. Member_1 area \'1\' (0.195) is small but stress high; consider keeping or increasing area if stress too close to limit after node move.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate new lengths: node_3 at (2,1.2). Length member_1: sqrt((2-0)^2 + (1.2-0)^2) = sqrt(4 + 1.44) = sqrt(5.44) ≈ 2.33. Mass member_1 = length * area. Area \'1\' = 0.195, mass = 2.33 * 0.195 = 0.454. Slight increase from 0.39 but stress should reduce. Member_3 length = 4.0 (node_1 to node_2, fixed). Area reduce from 1 to 0.195 mass from 6 to 1.17 approx. Member_6 length: from node_3(2,1.2) to node_4(2,3) = 1.8, area reduce from 1.759 to 0.782 mass = 1.8 * 0.782 = 1.41, down from 5.28. Total mass reduction expected. Check max stress with these changes, expect member_1 stress to reduce, member_3 stress low, member_6 stress low. Total mass approx 19.18 - (6-1.17) - (5.28-1.41) + (0.454-0.39) ~ 19.18 - 4.83 - 3.87 + 0.06 = 10.56 approx, well below 30.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Update node_3 to (2.0, 1.2).
