Mass is 19.18 < 30. Load at node_3, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Node_3 position can be adjusted to reduce stress. Member areas can be optimized for stress distribution.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_1 is highly stressed in compression (-28.78). Members connected to node_3 bear load. Node_3 is currently at (2.0, 0.0) on base line which may cause high compression in member_1. Moving node_3 vertically upward should reduce compression in member_1 and redistribute load. Member_6 with largest area (3) is moderate in stress (-4.02). Members_4 and 5 have moderate tensile stress, could reduce by adjusting node_4 or node_3. Node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) fixed. Node_3 can move only in y-direction since x=2.0 is fixed to avoid duplicate nodes.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try moving node_3 upward from y=0.0 to ~1.0-1.5 to reduce compression in member_1. Adjust member areas to reduce stress in member_1 and balance others. Possibly reduce area of member_1 from \'1\' (0.195) to \'0\' (1) is higher area, so keep \'1\' or increase if needed. Use area \'1\' or \'2\' for members with moderate stress. Member_3 has low stress (-4.6), area 0 (1) is large, can reduce area to 1 (0.195) to save mass if stress allows. Check mass after adjustments.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Raising node_3 reduces axial compression in member_1 by increasing member length and changing force angle. Reducing area of low stress members saves mass allowing increasing area for high stress members if needed. Maintaining closed truss shape and supports fixed.

Node_3 moved only vertically to maintain structure integrity and avoid node overlap.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate new member lengths with node_3 at (2.0, 1.2). Member_1 length = sqrt((2-0)^2 + (1.2-0)^2) = sqrt(4 + 1.44) = sqrt(5.44) ≈ 2.33. Member_2 length = sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-1.2)^2) = sqrt(16 + 1.44) = sqrt(17.44) ≈ 4.18. Member_6 length = sqrt((2-2)^2 + (1.2-3)^2) = 1.8. Member_3 length = 6.0 (unchanged). Member_4 length = sqrt((0-2)^2 + (0-3)^2) = sqrt(4 + 9) = 3.605. Member_5 length = sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-3)^2) = 5.0.
