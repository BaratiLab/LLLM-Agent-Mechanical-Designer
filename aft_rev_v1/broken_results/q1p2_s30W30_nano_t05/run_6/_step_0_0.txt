Must add members to form closed loop and select areas to minimize stress and mass.",\n\n  "analysis": "The given nodes are colinear on x-axis at y=0: node_1 at 0, node_3 at 2, node_2 at 6. To form a closed truss, must add at least one additional node off the line to create a triangle. Adding a new node (node_4) above the line will create a triangular closed truss: members (1-3), (3-2), (2-1) plus members connecting node_4 to nodes 1, 2, and 3. But instructions say no new nodes, so must form closed truss with given nodes only. Given only 3 nodes, the minimal closed truss is a triangle formed by connecting all three nodes: members (1-2), (2-3), (3-1). This is a triangle, closed loop. So members: member_1 (node_1-node_2), member_2 (node_2-node_3), member_3 (node_3-node_1).",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Check lengths of members: 1-2 length = 6, 2-3 length = 4, 3-1 length = 2.

Supports: node_1 pinned (both directions fixed), node_2 roller (vertical fixed). Use static equilibrium and truss analysis to find member forces. Then calculate stress = force / area.

The load at node_3 causes tension/compression in members. Assign areas starting small to minimize mass, increase only if stress limit exceeded. Mass = sum(length_i * area_i). Use areas: start with area=1 for all, check stress, then increase areas selectively.
