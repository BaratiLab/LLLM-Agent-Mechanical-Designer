First iteration, no prior data.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Three nodes aligned on x-axis. To form a closed truss, need at least a triangle. Current nodes form a degenerate triangle (collinear). To close truss, add one new node above line between node_1 and node_2 to form a stable triangle, allowing load transfer and minimizing stress. Load at node_3 is downward-left, so placing new node above should help distribute forces. Use minimal area members to reduce mass but ensure stress limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 above (between node_1 and node_2) at y > 0. Connect node_4 to all existing nodes for closure.
