Member_3 area too small (area_id=1=0.195), causes high stress. Member_4 area also small (area_id=1). Member_2 area large (3), but low stress - can reduce area to save mass. Member_5 area large (3), stress moderate (-4). Member_1 area moderate (2). The vertical node_4 at (2,3) creates high stress in members connecting to it. To reduce stress, increase cross-sectional area for highly stressed members or optimize node_4 position to reduce member length and force.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Options: (1) Increase area of member_3 and member_4; (2) reposition node_4 to reduce force; (3) add intermediate nodes for load path; (4) reduce area of low stress members to save mass.

Reduce area of member_2 from 3 to 1 (0.195) to save mass. Increase area of member_3 and member_4 to 3 (1.759) to reduce stress. Member_5 area reduce from 3 to 2 (0.782). Member_1 keep area 2 (0.782).
