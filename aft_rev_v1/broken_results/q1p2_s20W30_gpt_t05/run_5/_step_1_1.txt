Supports fixed at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current design max stress 29.05 > 20, mass 15.555 < 30. Need to reduce stress, especially member_3 (29.05) and member_4 (20.15).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has a vertical node_4 at (2,3) connected to node_1 and node_2 and node_3. Member_3 (node_1-node_4) is overstressed in tension (29.05). Member_4 (node_4-node_2) is also slightly over max stress (20.15). Member_5 (node_3-node_4) is under less stress (-4.02). Members connecting node_3 to supports have low stress. The vertical height of node_4 may cause high tension in member_3. Also, the member areas are relatively large (area_id 3 for member_2 and member_5) contributing to mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, consider lowering node_4 to reduce tension in member_3 and member_4. Possibly add a diagonal member from node_1 to node_2 to better distribute load. Adjust member areas, reduce large areas where stress is low, increase where stress is high but within limits. Possibly remove or relocate node_3 to better distribute load. Keep node_1 and node_2 fixed, node_3 can be moved along x-axis but not y=0 to avoid load node change. Alternatively, move node_4 horizontally to reduce tension in member_3.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Move node_4 lower and slightly right to (3.0, 1.5) to reduce tension in member_3 and member_4, add diagonal member from node_1 to node_2. Move node_3 to (3.0, 0.0) for better load path. Adjust member areas: use area_id 2 or 1 for low stress members, area_id 3 or 4 for higher stress members but keep max stress < 20.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Lowering node_4 reduces vertical span and tension in member_3. Adding diagonal member_6 (node_1-node_2) will create a triangular truss improving load distribution. Moving node_3 to center between supports balances the load path. Reducing member areas in low stress members reduces mass. Increasing areas in high stress members up to constraint reduces stress without excess mass. Triangular truss is statically stable and efficient.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(3,0), node_4(3,1.5).

Max stress expected < 20 due to reduced vertical height and added diagonal. Member_3 and member_4 stress reduced by shorter length and better support.
