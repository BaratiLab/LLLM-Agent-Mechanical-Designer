Load at node_3, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_1 has highest compressive stress (-13.06). Member_2 and member_5 have low stress. Member_4 and member_3 moderate. Area sizes range 2-4. Member_1 area=2 (0.782), member_2=3 (1.759), member_3=3 (1.759), member_4=4 (3.128), member_5=2 (0.782). Mass concentrated in member_4. Node_3 can be moved vertically to reduce compression in member_1 and tension in member_5.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_3 upwards slightly to reduce compression in member_1. Possibly shift node_4 slightly for better geometry. Maintain node_1 and node_2 fixed. Check member lengths and areas to keep mass under 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing vertical height of node_3 reduces axial compression in member_1 by increasing member_1 length and changing load path. This may also reduce tension in member_5. Slight adjustment of node_4 in vertical direction can optimize triangle shape for stress distribution. Keep areas same initially for mass control. Recalculate member lengths and estimate stress reduction accordingly.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: m1 = distance(node_1, node_3), m2 = distance(node_3, node_2), m3 = distance(node_1, node_4), m4 = distance(node_3, node_4), m5 = distance(node_2, node_4). Current: node_3 at (2.0,0.0). Move node_3 to (2.0, 0.5). Recalculate lengths and estimate stress changes.",\n  \n  "calculation": "New lengths (approx): m1 = sqrt((2-0)^2 + (0.5-0)^2) = sqrt(4+0.25)=2.06, m2 = sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-0.5)^2)=sqrt(16+0.25)=4.03, m4 = sqrt((2-2)^2 + (3-0.5)^2)=2.5. Mass roughly unchanged, slight increase in member_1 length balanced by stress reduction. Estimated stress reduction in member_1 from -13.06 to ~-10.5. Slight reduction in member_5 tension expected. Node_4 shifted slightly to (2.0, 3.2) to improve force distribution. Areas maintained for mass control.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Check total mass with new lengths and areas: sum(length * area) approx 28.5 < 30. Max stress estimated below 13.
