Member_2 length will increase slightly but stress is low, so acceptable. Increase area of member_1 to \'3\' (1.759) from \'2\' (0.782) to reduce stress. Decrease member_3 and member_5 area to \'2\' (0.782) from \'3\' (1.759) to save mass. Member_4 area can remain \'3\' as stress is lowest. This balances mass and stress within constraints.
