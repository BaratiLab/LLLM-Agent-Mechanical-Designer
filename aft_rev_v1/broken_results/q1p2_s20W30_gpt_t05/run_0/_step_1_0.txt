Load at node_3, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Node_3 and node_4 can be adjusted.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_1 (-13.06) which is compressive and high. Members connected to node_3 carry significant load. Node_3 is currently at (2,0), node_4 at (2,3). Members_1 and 2 have small cross-section (area_id=2, area=0.782), members 3,4,5 have area_id=3 (1.759). Mass is within limits but stress can be reduced by repositioning node_3 and node_4 to improve force distribution and possibly adjusting member areas within constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_3 upward and slightly right to reduce compression in member_1 and tension in member_2. Possibly increase area of highly stressed members or redistribute forces by geometry change. Maintain load/support nodes fixed.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing vertical height of node_3 reduces bending moment and axial load in member_1. Moving node_3 closer to node_2 can reduce length of member_2 and its stress. Node_4 can be shifted slightly right to balance forces in members 3,4,5. Member areas can be adjusted to reduce stress but must keep mass <30. Use area_id 3 or 4 for highly stressed members. Recalculate member lengths and estimate stress reduction by geometry improvement.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: m1: dist(node_1-node_3), m2: dist(node_3-node_2), m3: dist(node_1-node_4), m4: dist(node_2-node_4), m5: dist(node_3-node_4). Adjust node_3 from (2,0) to approx (3.0,0.8), node_4 from (2,3) to (3.0,3.2). This increases triangle height and redistributes forces.
