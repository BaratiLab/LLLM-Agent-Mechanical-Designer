Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Constraints: max stress Â±20, max mass 30. Current max stress 36.26 > 20, mass 20.36 < 30. Need stress reduction primarily.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current design has high tensile/compressive stress on member_6 (-36.26) and member_5 (34.17). Member_6 is node_3-node_1, a bottom chord member. Member_5 is node_5-node_1. The structure has 5 nodes plus one added node_5. The load at node_3 is causing high stress in bottom chord members. The top chord members have lower stresses. The mass is acceptable but stress exceeds limits. The current topology has some redundancy but stress concentration at bottom chord. The truss is asymmetric with node_5 near node_3 and node_4 above.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stresses, consider adding a vertical member at node_3 or reposition node_5 to better triangulate and redistribute forces. Possibly add a member from node_3 to node_4 or node_2. Adjust member areas to reduce high stress members by increasing area or redistributing load paths. Maintain support and load node positions. Avoid large areas to keep mass under 30. Possibly reduce member_1 area to save mass and increase critical members area.",\n\n    "proposal": "Add a new node_6 above node_3 at (2.0, 4.0) to form a higher triangle. Connect node_6 to node_4 and node_3. Add member node_3-node_6 and node_6-node_4. Remove member_6 (node_3-node_1) to reduce high stress bottom chord member. Adjust member areas: top chords area_id=2 (0.782), vertical and diagonals area_id=3 (1.759), bottom chord area_id=1 (0.195) to reduce mass but maintain strength. This creates a stiffer truss with better load path and reduces stress on bottom chord.",\n\n    "reasoning": "By adding node_6 above node_3, the truss height increases locally, improving load transfer from node_3 to top chord. Removing member_6 (high stress) avoids overstressed member and redistributes forces. New members with moderate area maintain strength. Using smaller area in bottom chord reduces mass and stress. The new topology is a modified Warren truss with verticals and diagonals, known for efficient load distribution. This should reduce max stress below 20 and keep mass under 30.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_1(0,0)-node_4(3.2,3.5): ~4.78; node_4-node_2(6,0): ~4.28; node_3(2,0)-node_5(2,2.5): 2.5; node_5-node_4: ~1.56; node_5-node_1: ~2.69; node_3-node_1 removed; new node_6 at (2,4); node_3-node_6: 4.0; node_6-node_4: ~1.56.
