Max stress ±20, Mass ≤ 30. Areas discrete from given set. Need closed truss (all nodes connected in closed loop).",\n  \n  "analysis": "The 3 nodes are colinear along x-axis, which cannot form a closed truss. To form a closed truss, an additional node off the line is needed to create a triangle. The simplest closed truss is a triangle. Load is at node_3 (2,0) with downward-left force. Supports at ends. Adding node_4 above the line near node_3 to form a triangle will improve stability and distribute load. Members will connect all nodes forming a triangle: (node_1-node_4), (node_4-node_2), (node_1-node_2), and also (node_3-node_4) to include loaded node_3. This forms a closed structure with all nodes connected. The area selection will balance stress and mass. Assume linear elastic behavior and static equilibrium. Use simple trigonometric relations to estimate member forces and lengths. Stress = Force / Area. Mass = sum(length × area).",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2, y) with y>0 to form triangle. Members: (1-4), (4-2), (1-2), (3-4), (1-3), (2-3). But to minimize mass, avoid redundant members; minimal closed truss is triangle with all nodes connected. Node_3 is colinear, so connect node_3 to node_4 and node_1 or node_2. Possibly form triangle: nodes 1,2,4 and connect 3 to 4. Members: (1-4), (4-2), (1-2), (3-4).",\n  \n  "reasoning": "To minimize stress, the truss should distribute load efficiently. A triangle is the simplest stable shape. Since node_3 is loaded and on the base line, adding node_4 above node_3 creates two triangles sharing base (1-2). Members (1-2), (1-4), (4-2) form the main triangle. Member (3-4) connects loaded node_3 to node_4, transferring load upward. Areas selected to keep stress ≤ 20 and mass ≤ 30. Member forces estimated by static equilibrium. Use areas from set to balance mass and stress. Approximate member length by Euclidean distance.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic, axial forces only, static equilibrium.

Supports reaction forces calculated assuming equilibrium. Member forces from method of joints or sections. Stress = Force / Area.

Lengths: L_14 = sqrt((2-0)^2 + (3-0)^2) = sqrt(4+9)=3.6056, L_42 = sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-3)^2) = sqrt(16+9)=5.0, L_12=6.0, L_34 = sqrt((2-2)^2+(3-0)^2)=3.0.

Approximate forces: member (3-4) force ~ load magnitude 10N, stress = 10/area ≤ 20 => area ≥ 0.5. Choose area_id=2 (0.782) for member (3-4). For (1-4) and (4-2), assume forces ~8N, area_id=1 (0.195) insufficient, choose area_id=2 (0.782). For (1-2), force ~5N, area_id=1 (0.195) sufficient.
