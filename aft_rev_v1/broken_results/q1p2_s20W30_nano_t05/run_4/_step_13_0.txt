Current max stress 250 exceeds ±20 limit, mass 16.65 < 30. Need to reduce stress drastically, keep mass controlled.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high stress in members 2, 3, 6, 7 with low area members (area_id=1). Members near load and top nodes are overstressed. Load node_3 at bottom center. Supports at ends. Current nodes cluster near center top (node_14, 15) but members with low area cause stress spikes. Mass is low but stress violates constraints. Need to redistribute load paths, add nodes and members to create effective load transfer and reduce stress concentration.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding nodes between load and supports, forming triangulated patterns to spread forces. Increase areas on critical members. Avoid long slender members with small areas. Keep mass under 30 by using small areas where possible.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add two nodes: node_16 at (1.0, 1.5) and node_17 at (4.0, 1.5) to create stable triangles between load node_3 and supports node_1 and node_2. Connect members: node_1-node_16, node_16-node_14, node_14-node_3, node_3-node_17, node_17-node_2, node_14-node_15, node_15-node_6, node_6-node_2, node_15-node_17, node_6-node_17, node_3-node_6. Assign areas carefully: higher area for members directly under load and load transfer paths (area_id=3 or 4), smaller areas (1 or 2) for secondary members. Keep members short and triangulated.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "By adding nodes 16 and 17 horizontally aligned with node_14 (2.0,1.5) and between load and supports, the load path is spread through multiple triangles reducing stress concentration. Increasing areas on members directly transferring load reduces stress. Triangulation assures stability and reduces bending/moment effects. Mass remains under 30 by limiting high-area members and using smaller areas on less critical members.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths calculated from node coordinates. Mass = sum(length * area factor). Stress estimated to reduce from ~250 to below 20 by area increase and better load path. Members near load with area 3 or 4; others area 1 or 2.
