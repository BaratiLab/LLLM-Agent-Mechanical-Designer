Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current max stress 84.7 > 20, mass 25.1 < 30. Need to reduce stress significantly, especially on member_7 and member_3.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current design has high tensile/compressive stress on members connected to node_3 and node_2 (member_7: -84.7, member_3: 53.2). Member_7 is the direct member between loaded node_3 and support node_2 with minimal area (area_id=1). Stress exceeds limits. Mass is acceptable but can be optimized. Node_8 added at (2,4) did not reduce stress sufficiently. Members with high stress are long or have small cross-section areas. Need better load path and triangulation to distribute loads and reduce stress peaks.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding a node between node_3 and node_2 to create a truss with better load distribution. Also add diagonal members to reduce bending and shear. Increase cross-section area on critical members. Possibly relocate node_8 or add a new node near (4,3) to form a stable triangular pattern with supports and load node. Avoid overly long members without intermediate supports.",\n\n    "proposal": "Add node_9 at (4.0, 2.5) to improve triangulation between node_3, node_2, and node_6. Connect members: node_3-node_9, node_9-node_2, node_9-node_6. Remove member_7 (node_3-node_2 direct) to reduce high stress. Adjust areas to reduce stress below 20. Keep existing nodes for load/support fixed. Use higher area for members under high stress but keep mass under 30.",\n\n    "reasoning": "By adding node_9 at (4.0, 2.5), we create additional load paths reducing stress concentration on member_7. Removing direct member_7 eliminates the highly stressed direct diagonal. New members form smaller triangles distributing forces. Increasing area on members connected to load and supports reduces stress. Using area_id=3 or 4 for critical members balances mass and strength. Shorter members reduce bending moments. This approach aligns with classical truss optimization principles.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and assign areas. Members with length ~2-3 m get area_id=3 (1.759) or 4 (3.128). Keep lighter members at area_id=2 (0.782). Check stress approximation by reducing load path length and increasing area. Sum member masses to verify total < 30. Target max stress < ±20.",\n\n    "calculation": "Member lengths (approx): node_1-node_4: 3.0 m, node_4-node_6: 1.0 m, node_6-node_2: 3.0 m, node_3-node_8 removed, add node_9 (4.0, 2.5). New members: node_3-node_9 ~2.06 m, node_9-node_2 ~1.80 m, node_9-node_6 ~0.71 m. Assign areas: node_1-node_4: 4 (3.128), node_4-node_6: 2 (0.782), node_6-node_2: 3 (1.759), node_3-node_4: 2 (0.782), node_3-node_9: 3 (1.759), node_9-node_2: 3 (1.759), node_9-node_6: 2 (0.782). Approximate mass: sum(length*area) ~ 3*3.128 + 1*0.782 + 3*1.759 + 2*0.782 + 2.06*1.759 +1.8*1.759 + 0.71*0.782 = 9.384 + 0.782 + 5.277 + 1.564 + 3.62 + 3.17 + 0.556 = ~24.35 < 30. Expected reduced max stress due to better load path and increased area.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate members or nodes. Load/support nodes fixed. Areas selected from given set.
