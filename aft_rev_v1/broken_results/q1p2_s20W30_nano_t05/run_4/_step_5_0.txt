Max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current max stress 84.7, mass 25.1. Need to reduce stress and keep mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high stress on member_7 (node_3-node_2) at -84.7, exceeding ±20 limit. Members near node_3 and node_2 are overstressed. The current node_8 at (2,4) added to reduce stress but insufficient. The direct member_7 is heavily loaded. Mass is within limit but stress is not. The structure lacks sufficient triangulation and load path to distribute force effectively.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, add nodes to better distribute load, especially near node_3 and between node_3 and node_2. Avoid direct long members under high load. Use smaller area members where stress is low and larger area where stress is high. Possibly remove direct member_7 or reduce its area and add alternate load paths.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add two new nodes between node_3 and node_2 and above node_3 to form a triangular load path. Remove direct member_7 and replace with members routing load through new nodes. Optimize member areas to keep stresses within ±20 and mass under 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Direct member from loaded node_3 to roller node_2 is overstressed. Introducing intermediate nodes creates shorter members and multiple load paths, reducing stress per member. Triangulation improves stability and distributes forces. Using moderate area sizes balances mass and strength. Node positions chosen to maintain geometry and optimize force distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "New nodes: node_9 near (3.5,1.5), node_10 near (2.5,2.5).
