Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current max stress 125 and mass 33.17 exceed limits.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high stress in member_8 (node_3-node_6) at 125, exceeding ±20. Total mass 33.17 > 30. Members with large areas (4 and 3) contribute to mass. Load node_3 is mid-span, causing high stress in diagonal members. Structure has nodes clustered near load but lacks sufficient triangulation and load path efficiency.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce max stress by redistributing forces via added nodes and members. Use smaller area members where possible. Add a node between node_3 and node_6 to reduce length and stress in long diagonals. Possibly add a node above node_3 to create a more stable triangular load path. Keep supports fixed and load node fixed.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_12 at (2.5, 1.5) between node_3 and node_6. Add node_13 at (1.5, 2.5) above node_3. Connect node_3 to node_12 and node_13, node_12 to node_6 and node_4, node_13 to node_4 and node_12. Use moderate area sizes to balance stress and mass. Remove high stress member_8 (node_3-node_6) replaced by shorter members with smaller areas. Maintain pinned and roller supports at node_1 and node_2.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding intermediate nodes reduces member length and stress concentration. Triangulation ensures load path distributes forces evenly. Smaller areas on shorter members reduce mass. Larger areas on main compression/tension members keep stresses within limits. Avoid direct long diagonal from node_3 to node_6 with high stress. This approach balances mass and stress constraints effectively.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_3-node_12 ~0.707, node_12-node_6 ~1.802, node_3-node_13 ~2.061, node_13-node_4 ~0.707, node_12-node_4 ~1.118. Assign areas: main members area 3 (1.759), smaller members area 1 (0.195) or 2 (0.782). Estimate mass and stress to keep total under 30 and max stress under 20.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Sum member lengths × area: members with area 3 and lengths ~1-2 add ~5 mass each; members with area 1 or 2 add less. Total estimated mass ~28-29. Max stress estimated by shorter members and better triangulation reduces stress below 20. Remove member_8 reduces high stress concentration. Members connecting to supports sized larger for load transfer.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes or members. Load/support nodes unchanged. Areas from allowed set.
