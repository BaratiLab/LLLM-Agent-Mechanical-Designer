Current max stress 68.5 > 20, mass 5.13 < 30. Need stress reduction mainly on member_4 and member_5. Areas currently mostly small, some members overstressed in tension/compression.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has a short top chord (node_1 to node_3) highly stressed (-68.5), and member_2 (node_2-node_4) stressed 34.4. Members connected to node_4 have moderate stress. Structure is minimal but stress limits exceeded. Member areas are small (area_id 1 or 2). Load direction causes bending and tension in bottom chord. Node_4 height reduced from prior iterations to 1.5m, possibly insufficient vertical support. No intermediate nodes between supports and load node except node_4. Members connecting node_3 to supports are overstressed.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, increase vertical support height or add a new node to create a triangular truss with shorter members under tension/compression. Increase member areas in critical members, use larger areas (3 or 4). Avoid large span members under tension. Keep mass under 30 by optimizing member lengths and areas. Remove direct diagonal member with high stress (node_1-node_3).",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add an intermediate node above node_3 at (2.0, 3.0). Connect node_3 to new node_7, node_7 to node_4, node_7 to node_1 and node_2. Keep supports and load nodes fixed. Use larger area for members from supports to node_7 and node_4 (area 4 or 5). Remove overstressed member_4 (node_1-node_3). Use triangular bracing to distribute load and reduce stresses.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_7 at (2.0,3.0) creates a truss apex above the load node, distributing forces into smaller members. This reduces stress in bottom chord and direct diagonal member. Using larger cross-section areas for vertical and diagonal members reduces stress. Removing direct member from node_1 to node_3 removes highly stressed member. Total member length increase is moderate; mass remains under 30 with careful area selection.
