Load: -10 at 45° down-left at node_3. Supports fixed at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Current max stress 68.5 > 20, mass 5.13 < 30. Need to reduce max stress drastically.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high tensile stress (-68.5) in member_4 (node_1-node_3) and compressive in member_2 (node_2-node_4) (34.4). The truss is minimal with 4 nodes and 5 members, no diagonal bracing between supports and load node except node_4 overhead. The height of node_4 (1.5) is low, causing large bending and stress in bottom chord members. Areas for members are small (1 or 2).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, increase vertical height of node_4 or add intermediate nodes to form more triangles distributing load. Increase cross-sectional area on high-stress members. Avoid increasing mass too much. Use higher area for tension members and add bracing between node_3 and node_4 or node_4 and supports.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add one new node (node_5) above node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) to increase height and form a truss with two triangles sharing node_4 and node_5. Connect node_5 to node_1, node_2, and node_4. Use larger area (4 or 5) for members connecting load node and supports to reduce stress. Adjust areas on bottom chord to reduce stress. Keep existing nodes for load and supports unchanged.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing height of truss reduces bending moments in bottom chord and distributes load better. Adding node_5 creates two triangular sub-trusses improving force paths. Using larger cross-section for high-stress members reduces stress. Using area id \'4\' (3.128) or \'5\' (4.887) balances stress reduction and mass increase. Keep mass under 30 by limiting large areas to critical members only.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculations: node_1-node_4 = sqrt((2-0)^2+(1.5-0)^2)=2.5, node_4-node_5=1.5, node_5-node_2=sqrt((6-2)^2+(0-3)^2)=5.0 approx. Cross-section area selection: bottom chord (node_1-node_3) area 3, diagonal members area 4 or 5. Mass approx sum(length*area). Stress estimation: larger area reduces stress proportionally.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Mass estimate: member_1 (node_1-node_4): length=2.5, area=3.128; mass=7.82. member_2 (node_2-node_5): length=5.0, area=3.128; mass=15.64. member_3 (node_3-node_4): length=1.5, area=4.887; mass=7.33. member_4 (node_1-node_3): length=2.0, area=1.759; mass=3.52. member_5 (node_4-node_5): length=1.5, area=1.759; mass=2.64. Total mass approx 36.95 (slightly above 30), reduce some areas to 2 (0.782) or 1 (0.195) to lower mass. Adjust member_2 area to 2 (0.782), mass=3.91. New total mass ~25.16.
