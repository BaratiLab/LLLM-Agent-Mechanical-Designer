Max stress Â±20, max mass 30. Current max stress 36.26 and mass 25.68 exceed stress limit. Nodes fixed at supports and load. Need to reduce stress on critical members, especially \'member_8\' (node_1-node_3) with -36.26 stress, and optimize member areas and connections.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high compressive stress on member_8 (node_1-node_3) and relatively heavy members with large areas. The load at node_3 is causing large bending and tension/compression in members connected to node_3 and node_1. The existing node_6 at (2.0,3.0) and node_5 at (3.0,1.5) help distribute forces but stress still too high. Member areas are large for some members, increasing mass. The structure can be improved by adding a node above node_3 to create a more direct load path to supports, reducing stress concentration, and adjusting member areas to meet constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing area of highly stressed members, adding a node above node_3 to create a vertical load path, connecting it properly to supports and load nodes. Use smaller areas where stress is low. Maintain pinned/roller supports. Check mass and stress iteratively.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_7 at (2.0, 2.5) above node_3. Connect node_3 to node_7, node_7 to node_4 and node_6, node_7 to node_1 and node_2. Remove direct node_1-node_3 member to reduce high stress. Adjust member areas: use area_id \'2\' or \'3\' for main load paths, smaller areas \'1\' or \'0\' for less stressed members. This creates a truss with better load distribution and reduced max stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_7 vertically above load node_3 creates a more direct vertical load path to supports, reducing bending in members. Removing the high-stress direct member_8 (node_1-node_3) avoids stress concentration. Connecting node_7 to node_4 and node_6 helps triangulate the structure and distribute forces. Using moderate areas on main load members balances mass and strength. Smaller areas on secondary members reduce mass. This approach is consistent with truss optimization principles to reduce member stresses and total mass within constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas estimated: node_3-node_7 ~0.5, node_7-node_4 ~0.5, node_7-node_6 ~1.0, node_7-node_1 ~3.0, node_7-node_2 ~4.0. Assign area_id \'3\' (1.759) for critical members, \'2\' (0.782) or \'1\' (0.195) for others. Expected mass under 30.
