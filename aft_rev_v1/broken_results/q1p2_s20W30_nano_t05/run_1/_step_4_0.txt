Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Existing nodes fixed for load/support. Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass 30.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current design max stress 34.19 > 20 and mass 25.8 < 30. Stress exceeds limits mainly in members connected to node_4 and node_3. Member_4 has max tensile stress 34.19. Member_3 compressive stress -30.85 also high. Member_1 and others near limits. Structure is lightly triangulated but stress too high on some members. Need to reduce stress by better load path and possibly reduce member areas or add nodes to redistribute forces.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Removing member_4 or reducing its area is risky due to load path. Adding a node above node_4 to create better triangulation and shorter members may reduce stress. Also, adjusting member areas to smaller cross-sections where stress is low can reduce mass. Avoid member_4 area 1; reduce or redistribute forces. Improve geometry to reduce bending and axial loads on critical members.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Add one node (node_6) above node_4 at (2.0, 3.0). Connect node_6 to node_4, node_5, and node_3 to form stable truss triangles. Remove member_4 (node_1-node_4) to reduce high tensile stress. Use smaller area for members under low stress and moderate area for high stress members. Maintain all load/support nodes fixed.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Adding node_6 at higher elevation creates more direct load paths from node_3 to supports through shorter members, reducing stress concentration. Removing member_4 (high tensile stress) forces load redistribution through node_6. Triangulation with node_6 reduces bending and axial overloads. Selecting areas carefully based on member length and expected stress will reduce mass and keep stress within ±20.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Areas chosen from given set: use area 2 (0.782) for main load carrying members, area 1 (0.195) for less stressed members. Calculate lengths and estimate stresses roughly by member force/area. Check total mass < 30. Verify max stress ≤ 20 by design.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node positions: node_6 (2.0, 3.0).
