Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Current max stress 36.26 > 20 limit. Mass 25.68 < 30 limit. Need stress reduction mainly on member_8 (node_1-node_3).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has high tensile stress on member_8 (-36.26), violating ±20 constraint. Mass is acceptable but close to limit. Members near load node_3 and support nodes need redesign. Existing nodes at load and supports fixed; internal nodes can be repositioned or added. Current design uses a complex member set with varying areas. Stress concentration on member_8 suggests load path imbalance. Adding vertical support member or redistributing load path can reduce peak stresses.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding a vertical member from node_3 upward to reduce stress on member_8. Possibly add node above node_3 for load transfer. Optimize member areas to reduce stress below 20. Use smaller areas for low-stress members to reduce mass. Avoid large single members with high stress. Reconfigure members around node_3 and node_4 for better force distribution.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_6 at (2.0, 2.5) above node_3 to create vertical load path. Connect node_3 to node_6, node_6 to node_4, and node_6 to node_5 (3.0, 1.5). Keep members from node_1 and node_2 to node_4. Remove direct member_8 (node_1-node_3) to reduce high stress. Use areas to balance mass and stress: assign area_id \'3\' (1.759) to main load carrying members and smaller areas to secondary members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_6 above node_3 creates a vertical load path, reducing bending and tensile stress in member_8. Removing member_8 reduces direct high stress. Connecting node_6 to node_4 and node_5 redistributes forces. Using area_id \'3\' balances strength and mass. Keeping supports at node_1 and node_2 unchanged maintains boundary conditions. This layout improves force flow and reduces peak stresses while keeping mass under 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths estimated: node_3 to node_6 ≈ 2.5 units, node_6 to node_4 ≈ 0.5 units, node_6 to node_5 ≈ ~1.12 units.
