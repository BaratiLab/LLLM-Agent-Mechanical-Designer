Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current max stress 68.5 (too high), mass 5.13 (acceptable). Need to reduce stress by redesign.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has 5 members connecting nodes 1,2,3,4. High compressive stress (-68.5) in member_4 (node_1-node_3) and tensile stresses exceed limits. The structure is minimal but insufficient to distribute load safely. Node_4 is low (y=1.5), limiting truss height and force distribution. Members between supports and loaded node are overloaded.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, increase truss height, add diagonal bracing, and use larger areas in critical tension/compression members. Avoid direct long horizontal members under heavy load. Add nodes to create triangular substructures for better force paths. Keep load/support nodes fixed.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a node above node_3 at y=3.0 to increase truss height. Connect this new node to node_1, node_2, node_3, and node_4 to form multiple triangles for load transfer. Use larger cross-section areas on members carrying high load. Remove direct node_1-node_3 and node_2-node_3 members (which are overstressed).",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing height improves load path and reduces axial forces. Triangulation stabilizes structure and reduces member stresses. Removing direct horizontal members under load avoids bending and high stress. Assign areas from given set to keep mass low but strength sufficient. Estimated mass remains well below 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "New nodes: node_5 at (2.0, 3.0). Members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_3, node_5-node_2, node_5-node_1, node_3-node_4. Areas chosen to balance mass and stress (e.g., area_id 3 or 4 for critical members).",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_4 ~1.5, node_2-node_4 ~4.0, node_4-node_5 ~1.5, node_5-node_3 ~3.0, node_5-node_2 ~4.12, node_5-node_1 ~2.24, node_3-node_4 ~1.5. Assign area_id 3 (1.759) to high load members, area_id 1 (0.195) to lighter members. Estimated mass sum < 20. Max stress expected < 20 due to triangulation and increased height.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes or members, load/support nodes unchanged, areas from allowed set, mass <30, max stress ±20.
