Current max stress 68.5 exceeds limit; mass 5.13 is acceptable. Load is -10 N at node_3 at -45°. Supports fixed. Node_4 at (2,1.5) connects others. Members with area IDs 1 or 2 mostly. Need to reduce stress, especially on member_4 (-68.5).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure is lightweight but highly overstressed, especially in member_4 (node_1-node_3). Members directly connected to load node_3 show high stress. Structure is minimal with only 4 nodes. Lack of additional vertical or diagonal bracing leads to stress concentration. Increasing member areas or adding nodes can reduce stress. However, increasing area too much increases mass. Adding node above node_3 to redistribute forces can help reduce stresses. Keep load and support nodes fixed. Use areas from given set, favor moderate areas to balance mass and strength.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_4 is critical, length 2.0 m (node_1 to node_3). Area currently 1 (0.195). Increasing area to 3 (1.759) or 4 (3.128) reduces stress. Alternatively, adding node above node_3 and connecting to node_1 and node_2 can create truss action, reducing stress on member_4. Member_2 (node_2-node_4) has high stress (34.4), area 1 (0.195), can increase area or redistribute forces. Member_5 (node_2-node_3) also stressed (-32.2).",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node_5 above node_3 at (2.0, 3.0). Connect node_5 to node_1, node_2, and node_4. Increase member areas on critical members, especially those connected to load node_3 and node_4. Use area IDs 3 or 4 for main load paths. Keep existing nodes and supports fixed. Remove member_4 (node_1-node_3) to avoid direct overstressed member. New members: node_1-node_5, node_2-node_5, node_4-node_5, node_3-node_5.

Removing member_4 avoids direct high stress. Increasing areas on members connecting node_5 to supports and node_4 reduces stress by increasing cross-sectional area.
