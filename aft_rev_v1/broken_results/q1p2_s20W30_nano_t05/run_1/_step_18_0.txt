Existing design has max stress ~194, exceeding ±20 limit. Total mass ~23.8 under 30. Need to reduce stress significantly and keep mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current max stress member_5 is -193.6, far exceeding allowable ±20. High stress likely due to load transfer path and member sizing. Mass is acceptable but stress violation critical. Members with large cross-section areas still overstressed, indicating geometry and connectivity need change. Node_1 and node_2 fixed; node_3 load fixed. Nodes 4,5,6 can be repositioned or replaced. Members 7,8,9 with small areas have moderate stresses but don\'t solve main stress peak at member_5.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress, need better load path from node_3 to supports, more triangulation, and possibly larger cross-section members in critical members. Adding intermediate nodes to distribute forces and create stiffer truss. Avoid overly long or heavily loaded members. Use areas from set for efficient sizing. Keep total mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Maintain nodes 1,2,3 as is. Add two new nodes: node_7 at (3.0, 2.0) and node_8 at (1.5, 1.5) to improve triangulation and load path. Connect members: node_1-node_8, node_8-node_4, node_4-node_7, node_7-node_2, node_3-node_8, node_3-node_7, node_5-node_7, node_5-node_2, node_4-node_5, node_8-node_3. Assign areas to keep stresses ≤20 and mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_7 near middle top between node_2 and node_4 helps distribute forces from node_3 load to supports. Node_8 near node_1 and node_4 helps triangulate bottom left region. Members from node_3 to node_7 and node_8 provide alternate load paths, reducing stress concentration on member_5. Using mid-range areas (2 or 3) on critical members balances mass and strength. Shorter members reduce bending and stress. Triangular substructures improve stability and reduce peak stresses.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and assign areas: node_1-node_8 ~2.12m, node_8-node_4 ~0.71m, node_4-node_7 ~1.0m, node_7-node_2 ~3.16m, node_3-node_8 ~1.58m, node_3-node_7 ~1.8m, node_5-node_7 ~1.12m, node_5-node_2 ~2.24m, node_4-node_5 ~2.24m, node_8-node_3 ~1.58m. Assign areas mostly 2 or 3, except some 1 for less stressed members. Total mass estimate below 30. Max stress checked by force redistribution and member sizing.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Sum member length × area: approx (2.12*3)+(0.71*1)+(1.0*2)+(3.16*2)+(1.58*3)+(1.8*3)+(1.12*2)+(2.24*1)+(2.24*2)+(1.58*2) = 6.36+0.71+2+6.32+4.74+5.4+2.24+2.24+4.48+3.16=37.65 (over 30). Reduce some areas to 1 or 0.782 where possible. Adjust node_8 y from 1.5 to 1.2 to shorten members. Recalculate mass: (2.12*2)+(0.71*1)+(1.0*1)+(3.16*1)+(1.58*2)+(1.8*2)+(1.12*1)+(2.24*1)+(2.24*1)+(1.58*1)=4.24+0.71+1+3.16+3.16+3.6+1.12+2.24+2.24+1.58=22.05 <30.
