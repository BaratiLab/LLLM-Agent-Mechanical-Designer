Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) provide vertical and horizontal restraint. Need to add at least one new node to close the truss and ensure structural stability against the angled load. Area selection critical to limit stress and mass.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current nodes are collinear: node_1(0,0), node_3(2,0), node_2(6,0). Load is -10N at node_3 at -45°, leading to vertical and horizontal components of equal magnitude (~7.07N). Without vertical nodes forming a triangle, structure cannot resist load properly and manage stress. For closed truss, add node above, create two additional diagonal members connecting node_3 to new node and new node to node_1 and node_2, producing triangles. Select minimal areas on long members, increased area on highly stressed near load. Estimate forces via static equilibrium assumptions. "+\n  "To limit mass, choose mi-sized areas — mass = sum(length * area_i), area mapping given. Select area IDs close to 1 or below 1 if possible to reduce mass while controlling stress.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 above node_3 at y ~3 for triangle height for good force distribution. Final members: (1-3),(3-2),(1-4),(2-4),(3-4) to form closed stable truss with well-triangulated shape. Approximate member lengths and forces, choose areas filtered by length-force to keep stress in ±15 range. Sum mass, compare with 30 limit. Adjust top beam areas.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Stress = Force / Area (simplified). Forces approximated by resolving load into reactions, then internal member axial loads via static analysis with assumed geometry. Use length from node distances, mass approx = sum(length * area_id). Key assumption: linear elastic axial behavior, no bending. Ensure connection arcs to maintain stability and stress limits. Minimize max stress by assigning larger area to members with higher forces, limiting mass by choosing lower area for longer members where stress is low.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: (1-3)=2, (3-2)=4, (1-4), (2-4), (3-4); node_4 approx at (2.0,3.0).
