A fourth node placed above node_3 will form triangles, sacrificing minimal length. Load on node_3 downward at 45°, stress should be balanced. Mass constrained to 30, so limit member lengths*areas. Areas can vary from 0.195 up to 19.548. Stresses capped ±15, so cross-section must be chosen proportional to expected force.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 ~ (2.0, 3.5) forming two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_3, node_2, node_4).

Existing members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, and node_1-node_2. But current node_1-node_3 length=2, node_3-node_2=4, node_1-node_2=6.
