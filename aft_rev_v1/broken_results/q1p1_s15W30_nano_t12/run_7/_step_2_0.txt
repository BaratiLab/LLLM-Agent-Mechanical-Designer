Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Existing nodes and members cause max stress 43.35 > 15 and mass 18.96 < 30, so stress constraint violated without exceeding mass. Node_5 added last iteration did not resolve stress issue.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High stress on member_6 (node_1 to node_5) over limit implicates design flaw spreading load improperly. Current member_6 area = 1 (0.195), light area correlates with high stress. Also member_2 and member_3 with large areas (3 and 3) may cause high mass despite low stress. Need reconfiguration to distribute load effectively, reduce member length and use areas fit to stress bounds. Node_5 position at (4,4) creates large levers. Load node is on the base line with no directly vertical member from load to supports to counterbalance. Current approach ineffective.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reconsider node arrangement to form stable triangles effectively absorbing force from node_3 diagonally. Introduce nodes above base line to create triangulated truss events. Consider removing node_5 or relocating, introduce optimized middle joint (node_4) for effective bridging of forces. Maintain load and support nodes fixed. Assign optimal member areas from catalog to limit stress and minimize excess mass. Avoid redundancy in members, keep geometry focused on triangular stability for efficient force paths.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep nodes node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0) fixed. Add node_4 at (2.5, 3.5) to form apex above load node_3. Add node_5 at (4.0,3.0) right apex toward node_2. Define members connecting: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_3-node_5, node_4-node_2. Assign member areas selected to keep stress ±15 and total mass <= 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "By lifting node_4 and node_5 above base line, we create triangles transferring loads properly toward supports, reducing peak stress on any member. Distribute tension and compression through triangulated members effectively. Addition and repositioning of intermediate nodes enable better stress distribution and area balance usage. Using intermediate node near load transfers force vertically as well as sideways. Avoid overly large members to control mass. Thin members near supports, moderate size toward load paths.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approx: node_1-node_3 ~2.0, node_3-node_4 ~3.2, node_4-node_5 ~1.8, node_5-node_2 ~3.162, node_1-node_4 ~4.3, node_3-node_5 ~2.24, node_4-node_2 ~3.2. Tentative areas selected to cap max member force impact to stress limit 15MPa approx, mass = sum(length × area).
