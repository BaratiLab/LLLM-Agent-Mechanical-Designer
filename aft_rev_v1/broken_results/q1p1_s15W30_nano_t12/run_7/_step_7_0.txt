Max stress magnitude ≤15; mass ≤30. Current design violates stress on member_3(53) and member_5(-16.6), and member_7(-30.6). Load/stress off main compression stressed members. Need to revise members forming main load path.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has excessive compressive stress on member_5 (node_1-node_7) and tensile stress on member_3 (node_4-node_7), and high compression on member_7 (node_8-node_9). This indicates load path is forcing some members in high stress beyond allowable limits. Mass is below max. Members from node_1 to node_7 carry significant loads; connecting node_3 and nodes off vertical gives potentially inefficient force paths. The load at node_3 at 45° downward left needs leaner and more balanced lattice with nodes at correct elevation for load transfer. Existing design creates long members with big length mismatch and sizes leading to high member stress concentrated on single members. Node_8 and node_9 are close thus minimal contribution.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce load path lengths to distribute force better; especially reduce stressed members length or remove/replace high area members with possibly more members of optimal smaller cross sections. Potentially move node_7 slightly, add an extra node near load for better force distribution. Replace large area members causing stress concentration with multiple members. Add diagonal members to create triangular subnetworks in loaded area for better stress distribution.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node \'node_10\' near load node_3 at position (2.3, 1.5) to distribute load. Move node_8 driveway closer to (2.7,2.1), join node_10 with node_4 and node_8 to create a triangular load transfer network. Strengthen the load area using small area member sets (area_id \'2\' or \'1\') to reduce stress in main compression member (node_1-node_7). Remove existing very stressed member_5 (node_1-node_7) with area 3 and split load via node_10 and diagonals. Set cross-section areas carefully by matching ≤ moderate values to keep stress within ±15 and mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular substructures distribute load uniformly; adding node_10 allows splitting the large compression path from node_1 to node_7 into smaller segments reducing excessive axial force. More members efficiently share the load, allowing smaller individual cross-section on members and less mass. Reducing length of high stress members reduce stress magnitudes. Connections adjusting to formation of simpler triangular trusses increases stiffness and reduces stress.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assume force in direction -10N at -45°, equally distributed from node_3 via nodes 10, 4, 7, building multi-triangle framework. Calculate member length times area sum to stay under mass constraints (max length approx sum 15 * worst area). Stress checked to stay ≤15 using factors. Use area_id up to \'3\' for larger compression members only, mostly \'1\' or \'2\' for diagonals to reduce overall mass. No members exceeding limits can remain.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Mass approx calculation (length * density) check: let main members (node_1-node_10), (node_10-node_4), (node_4-node_7) have area_id \'3\'=1.759 and rests diagonals \'1\' 0.195 or \'2\' 0.782.

Stress estimated distributed better due to smaller compression length and multiple load paths.\n  \n  Replace highly stressed member_5 area 3 with members of smaller area along shorter length members with distributed load path.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_final": "Ensure no overlapping members, support & load nodes fixed, new node added only near load.
