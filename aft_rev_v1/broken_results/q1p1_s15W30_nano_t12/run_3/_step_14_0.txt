Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Current max stress too high (167.4), mass ~11 <30 constraint.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure has elements (member_5,6,7) exceeding ±15 stress limit causing violation mainly due to under-sized members or stress concentration. Mass is within limit but stresses indicate unstable or inefficient load paths. Direct connection between node_4 and node_5 leads to excessive compression, members near load show excessive stresses. Need better triangulation near load and path from load to supports to distribute forces evenly. Adding a new node strategically above load to better transfer load can reduce stress.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Member 5 has compressive stress -167 largely violating constraints; reduce load path length CA steady distribution. Maybe reinforce bottom chord with optimized section or replace some members by smaller sections to reduce mass while maintaining strength. Avoid hanging node_5 in tension; reconfigure to optimal triangles.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Modify structure: keep support and load nodes fixed. Add one node \'node_6\' vertically above node_3 at ~y=2.2m, creating two triangles for load transfer. New members: node_3-node_6, node_6-node_4, node_6-node_5; remove node_5-node_3 direct member. Use moderate to high area indexes for main compression (3 and 2), low area for tension members near load and supports to limit stress and mass. Resulting changed member topology is more stable with redistribution. This distributes force and reduces large compressive stress on single member.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Adding node_6 above node_3 near load point helps spread load path up to supports, while removing direct short high-stress member decreases concentrated compressive stress. By using areas 3 for main supports and 2 or 1 instead of 1 directly, balance strength and mass. Triangulation should prevent failure. Prior iteration success shows areas 2 and 3 manage stresses appropriately. Structure mass expected below 30 with improved maximum stress below ±15.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Use length calculation: Distances approx: node_3(2,0), node_6(2,2.2) length=2.2; node_6(2,2.2)-node_4(2,3) length=0.8; node_6(2,2.2)-node_5(3.5,1.4) length~1.72. Mass estimate sum length*area with areas mostly <=3 should keep mass under 30. Stress distribution improves by load spreading via node_6.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Calculate member lengths and mass: member_1 node_1-node_4 (area 3): length ~3, mass ~ 3*1.759=5.28; member_2 node_4-node_2 (area 3): length 4 approx, mass ~7.037; member_3 node_1-node_3 (area 1): length 2, mass ~2*0.195=0.39; member_4 node_3-node_2 (area 1): length 4, mass 0.195*4=0.78; member_5 node_4-node_6 (area 2): length 0.8, mass ~0.626; member_6 node_6-node_5 (area 2): length 1.72, mass ~1.344; member_7 node_5-node_2 (area 2): length 3.5, mass ~2.737.
