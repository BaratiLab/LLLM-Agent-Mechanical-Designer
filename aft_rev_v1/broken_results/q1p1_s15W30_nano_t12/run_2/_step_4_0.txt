Supports are pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Original structure violates mass constraint (mass > 30). Members have varied stress levels, below max stress. Need to reduce mass mainly by downscaling cross-section areas, and adjust geometry slightly for better load paths. Current max stress is fine (9.23 < 15). Areas chosen must be from given set, coordinate positions precise.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current mass 40.56 > 30 max. Max stress 9.23 < 15 (OK). Heavy members: member_7 (13.13 mass, area 3), member_6 (7.05 mass, area 3). These are longest links. Area 3 (1.759) might be oversized. Node_6 high in Y (7.4) results in long members from nodes 3 & 4 to 6. Adding node_6 dramatically increased mass. Proposal: remove node_6, shorten structure or move node_4 for better height and distribution, reduce cross-sectional areas to lighter ones while maintaining stress ≤ 15, increase the height slightly for load path, keep supports fixed, adjust node_4\'s position for better triangulation.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Trying removing node_6, advance node_4 slightly up and stretched horizontally for better load transfer, use area sizes between 1 and 3 (preferably 1, 2 or smaller to reduce mass). Consider creating triangle between nodes 1,2,4 with node_3 as lower support node connecting. Create members from node_3 to node_1/2 for load distribution.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_6. Use nodes 1, 2, 3, 4 only. Positions: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(3,0) moved to center, node_4 at (3,4) higher to balance truss. Members: (1-3), (2-3), (1-4), (2-4), (3-4). Assign areas balancing mass and stress: low values for shorter members, higher for longer or more stressed members within limits. Use area code \'2\' (0.782) for main members; minimal cross section \'1\' (0.195) for minor tension members. Estimated total mass under 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Simplifying truss reduces total length, mass. Height adjustment improves stress distribution. Using symmetrical layout to balance loads. Centralized load at node_3 inline reduces bending stresses. Areas chosen to limit mass and maintain stress limits by stiffness in key members. Remove node_6 avoids excessive member length and mass.

Choose area 2(0.782) for longer members to save mass with enough capacity, area 1(0.195) for smaller tension members.
