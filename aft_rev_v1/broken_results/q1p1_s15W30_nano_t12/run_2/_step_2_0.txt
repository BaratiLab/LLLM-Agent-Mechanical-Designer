Max stress ±15, max mass 30. Prior stresses exceed limits and low area members cause overload in member_2.",\n\n    "analysis": "Member_2 overstressed (-32.67 vs ±15). Member area too small (area 1 = 0.195) under load. Member_4 light area but carries load. Node_4 position influenced stress. Larger cross section or better triangulation needed. Current max stress on member_2 too high. Need to revise nodes or members.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Increase member areas on tension/compression paths. Adjust node_4 position for better load distribution. Add node between node_3 and node_4 possibly for extra bracing. Remove horizontal member_1 or reduce its load. Try area sizes for critical members to max area class 3 or 4 first to check stress.",\n\n    "proposal": "Keep nodes 1, 2, 3 fixed. Add new node_5 near (4.0,1.0) to help triangulate between node_2 and node_4, and to lighten forces on member_2 and member_4. Members connecting: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_4-node_5 all with areas adjusted to not exceed stress. Increase areas for highly loaded members (3 or 4).",\n\n    "reasoning": "Additional node improves load path, reduces long direct spans carrying load. Triangular formations improve stability and distribute forces. Increasing cross-sectional area reduces stress. Keeping node_3 at 2.0,0 maintains load, node_5 at (4, 1) introduces support between node_2 and node_4, better balancing tension and compression. This arrangement minimizes large stress concentration in member_2 and member_4.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Check length of members for mass: mass = length × area. Areas tried mostly 1-4 range. Keep total mass well below 30 to accommodate moderate increase of member areas. Calculate element lengths based on coordinates. Apply 2D truss formulas or heuristic approximation for expected stress distribution.",\n\n    "calculation": "Lengths: node_1-node_3 ~ 2.0 m, node_3-node_5 ~ sqrt((4-2)^2+(1-0)^2)=2.236m, node_5-node_2 = sqrt((6-4)^2 + (0-1)^2)=2.236m, node_1-node_4 ~ sqrt((2.7)^2 + (3.4)^2)=4.38m approx, node_2-node_4 ~ sqrt((6-2.7)^2 + (0-3.4)^2)=4.5m approx, node_4-node_5 ~ sqrt((4-2.7)^2 + (1-3.4)^2)=2.73m; approximate mass sum using areas ≤ 4 (3.128), typical:\n\n- member_1 (node_1-node_3): area 3 (1.759) mass ~2.0m ×1.759=3.52\n- member_2 (node_3-node_5): area 3 (1.759) mass ~2.236×1.759=3.93\n- member_3 (node_5-node_2): area 4 (3.128) mass ~2.236×3.128=7.0\n- member_4 (node_1-node_4): area 2 (0.782) mass ~4.38×0.782=3.42\n- member_5 (node_2-node_4): area 2 (0.782) mass ~4.5×0.782=3.52\n- member_6 (node_4-node_5): area 3 (1.759) mass ~2.73×1.759=4.8\n\nTotal mass ~approx 26.2, below 30.
