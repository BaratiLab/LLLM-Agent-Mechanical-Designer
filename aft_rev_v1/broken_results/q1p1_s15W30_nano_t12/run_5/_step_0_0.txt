Load: -10 at 45° down-left on node_3. Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Constraints: max stress ±15, max mass 30. Structure must be closed (all connected).",\n    \n    "analysis": "To create a closed truss with given nodes, add members forming a triangle connecting all nodes. With a load at node_3 downward-left, members should share load to keep stress low. Area must support max stress ±15 with min mass under 30. Using linear elastic axial load, assume truss members only axial forces. Optimal shape: triangle formed by nodes 1-2-3, minimal additional nodes to keep target mass low.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Members: (1-3), (3-2), (1-2). Lengths: (1-3)=2m, (3-2)=4m, (1-2)=6m. Try to assign areas prioritizing low mass but enough capacity for stress. Use largest area for shortest members, smaller to longer to balance tension/compression. Calculate approximate forces with static equilibrium and assign accordingly.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "To minimize stress and mass, the design uses a triangle (closed), assigning areas to members balancing internal forces. Load on node_3 at -10 (-45°) implies axial members carry axial force accordingly. Compression and tensionShared by (1-3), (3-2). (1-2) stabilizes horizontal displacement. Use assumptions: axial force F = P projected along member direction. Stress σ = F/A, so A=F/σmax conservatively. Mass approx sum(length * area).",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate forces in triangle members via equilibrium. Load: Force vector @ node_3: Fx = -10*cos(45°) = -7.07, Fy = -10*sin(45°) = -7.07. Apply static equilibrium at nodes with reaction forces unknown; internally solve assuming cable triangle. Member lengths given. Use hypotenuse formulas for connection angles and member force components.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Calculate member lengths: L_13 = 2.0, L_32 = 4.0, L_12 = 6.0. Assume forces internally and estimate: Member (1-3) oriented horizontally right; member (3-2) horizontal right; member (1-2) horizontal. Given load at node_3, member (1-3) tension ~7.07, member (3-2) ~7.07 (to balance vertical), member (1-2) compression to oppose horizontal displacement. Assign areas: for 7.07 force, area = force / max stress = 7.07/15 ≈ 0.472. Choose nearest area above 0.472: id \'2\' → 0.782. For (1-2), a longer, compressive member resisting horizontal, force ~7.07, use area id \'2\' as well. Mass = sum length*area: 2*0.782 + 4*0.782 + 6*0.782 = 9.36 which is <30. Stress under limit.
