Current mass 5.51, max stress 65.27 above ±15 limit. Max member area options known. Need lower stresses, keep total mass ≤30.",\n     \n    "analysis": "Current max stress is too high mainly in member_1 (-65.27). Member areas mostly equal 1 (0.195), 2 (0.782), or 3 (1.759). Current structure shows member_1 is overstressed in compression. The structure is simple and light but unstable under load; adding nodes and changing geometry can distribute forces better, reduce stress. The key is avoiding very high compressive stress in member_1 and tensile stress in member_3. The plastic hinge or long slender members cause stress spikes. Adding a node above node_4 to make the truss triangulation more uniform and ensuring triangulation from the supports to force may help. Also upgrade areas for members critical in tension/compression to handle higher forces."\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Add one more node \'node_5\' at (3.0, 4.0) to increase vertical depth. Make members from node_1 and node_2 to node_5 and to node_4 and node_3. Use larger area in primary load bearing members. Limit member lengths to avoid buckling. Connect all nodes to form several triangles. Expected stress will drop below 15 and mass remain below 30 by selective larger areas in main load path and smaller areas on minor members",\n\n    "proposal": "Add node_5 at (3.0,4.0). Maintain support and load nodes as is. Define members: node_1-node_3 (area 2), node_3-node_5 (area 3), node_5-node_2 (area 2), node_1-node_5 (area 2), node_3-node_4 (area 1), node_4-node_5 (area 1), node_4-node_2 (area 1), node_1-node_4 (area 1). This provides more triangular substructures giving better load distribution. Use areas between 0.782-1.759 for load-carrying members to lower stress. Keep small areas for secondary members to limit mass.",\n\n    "reasoning": "The added node_5 increases vertical stiffness and creates multiple triangular load paths. Enlarging certain member areas reduces stress. Areas chosen balance mass vs strength. Distributing stress over more members reduces max stress below 15. Member connections form stable triangulated truss avoiding bending stress. This leads to reliable support under force at node_3 at angle -45°. Buckling risk minimized by keeping member lengths shorter via node_5.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_3:2.0m, node_3-node_5:sqrt((3-2)^2+(4-0)^2)=~4.12m, node_5-node_2:sqrt((6-3)^2+(0-4)^2)=5m approx, node_1-node_5:sqrt(3^2+4^2)=5m, node_3-node_4:sqrt((3-2)^2+(2.5-0)^2)~2.69, node_4-node_5:1.5m, node_4-node_2: sqrt((6-3)^2+0-2.5)^2=~3.0, node_1-node_4:3.0m.
