Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Current structure too light but has high compressive stress at member_1 (-65.27) far above limit. Objective is to reduce stresses and distribute load better, keep mass within 30 units. Node_4 position at (3, 2.5) seems suboptimal for load transfer with current members all small area 1 or 2. Added mass capacity (max 30), so some members can have bigger area for stress control. Possibly add one more node higher to alleviate stresses and introduce triangular substructure. Maintain support/load nodes positions, move or add internal nodes selectively to reduce stress in members especially from node_1 to node_3 and to node_4.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max compressive stress of -65 in member_1 (node_1-node_3) results from load path concentrating forcing this member to hold large compressive force. Other members have smaller stress and mass at small areas, some underutilized. Structural system insufficient to dissipate combined tensile/compressive forces when load acts at 45° downward at node_3. Lightweight design causes very thin members leading to infeasibility. Need better load triangulation and balance between tension and compression. Addition of intermediate node above node_4 should reduce member_1 compression by splitting axial force and adding stiffness.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding node_5 above node_4 near (3.5,4.0) to form upper triangle with nodes 4 and 2, redistributing forces; let\'s assign appropriate member areas from given discrete set [0:1,1:0.195,...] ensuring member_1 area not minimal to prevent overstress, switch it to area 3 or 4. Check length of members and choose corresponding mass impact. Example: member lengths calculated with distance formula for mass. Optimize all areas to reduce max stress within ±15 limits.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (3.5, 4.0). Connect member_6 (node_4-node_5), member_7 (node_2-node_5), member_8 (node_3-node_5) and revise areas. Increase members from node_1 to node_4, and to node_3 to larger area 3/4. Keep loads at node_3 and supports fixed. Member dict resets accordingly. Aim redistributed force paths prevent member 1 from excessive compression, plan areas as area_id \'3\' or higher for high force members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Placing node_5 above node_4 increases height allowing upper triangulation reducing load on node_1→node_3. Members linking node_5 to node_2 and node_3 anchor forces spreading load over multiple paths. Larger cross section areas selected on members closer to supports or carrying higher stress reduce stress intensity and reduce mass by optimizing slender members elsewhere. Members to node_5 must support combined axial loads; set these at area approx 3 to 4 to manage stress. Avoid too large area for mass constraint within 30 units.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Dist(node_1,node_3)=2m, dist(node_3,node_4)=~2.6m, dist(node_4,node_2)=sqrt((6-3)^2 + (0-2.5)^2)=~3.9m. New lengths: node_4-node_5 = 1.5m, node_5-node_2 = approx 2.06m, node_3-node_5 = ~4.0m. Calculate member mass = length*area with respective areas. Total mass constraints require fine-tuning areas: member_1 area 3(1.759) mass=2*1.759=3.518 unit across 2 m length ×1.759 = mass ~3.518 etc. Add up total to check <30, adjust.
