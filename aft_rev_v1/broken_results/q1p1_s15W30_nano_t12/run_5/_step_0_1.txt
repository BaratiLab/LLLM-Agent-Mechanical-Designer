Direct members connecting node_1-node_3 and node_2-node_3 exist by default. A closed truss with 3 nodes needs at least a triangle (all pairs connected). To improve_LOAD distribution and minimize stress, add member node_1-node_2 across bottom (length 6). This forms a triangle. Assigning cross-sectional areas to minimize stress and mass without exceeding constraints. The longest member is node_1-node_2 = 6 units; others shorter.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangle with side lengths: n1-n2=6, n1-n3=2, n2-n3=4. Each member will be sized to maintain stress limits.

Areas chosen from given filepath to pass stress and mass constraints. Stress = Force/Area ≤ 15. Calculate forces via equilibrium. Simplified trigonometry: forces approximate assuming axial loading.

Since node_3 load is small, use smaller areas on shorter members and larger on longest member node_1-node_2, which carries more load horizontally.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: L_1_2=6, L_1_3=2, L_2_3=4.
