All nodes on x-axis; structure is currently a line, not closed. Need to add at least one intermediate node off-axis to create a triangle (minimum closed polygon). Triangular geometry stable and good for low stresses. Truss members connecting nodes form a triangle with three members. Choose moderate areas to control stresses and mass. Load direction ~225°, affects tension/compression in members linked to node_3. Approximate load sharing via static equilibrium.

Close the structure by adding a single node_4 off the horizontal line to form a triangular closed shape to resist loads efficiently. 2. Use pinned and roller supports\' reaction force channels assuming upward/sideway for force equilibrium. 3. Estimate stresses assuming conservative uniform load sharing, load vertical component divisible between members connected to node_3. 4. Use member 1-2 with largest area to withstand max stress, smaller for the others for mass optimization. 5. Support statics ensure full stability without extra nodes. 6.
