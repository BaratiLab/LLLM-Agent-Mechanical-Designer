Current max stress ~9.54, total mass ~18.46, both well within limits.",\n  "analysis": "Current design has well-distributed members and areas (all area_id \'2\' corresponding to 0.782 area). Max stress is moderate, mass is moderate. Load and supports fixed. Node_3 can move but is currently on the baseline at y=0, causing stress concentration in members connected there. Increasing y of node_3 may reduce compressive stress on member_5 (-9.54).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Moving node_3 upward from y=0 to reduce compressive stress in members connected to it. Consider increasing node_3 y to ~1.5-2.0. Adjust member connections to maintain closed truss. Areas can remain at \'2\' to keep mass low.",\n  "reasoning": "Raising node_3 increases triangle heights, reducing stress in bottom chord members. Keeping areas uniform simplifies mass. Avoid adding members to prevent mass increase. Node_3 movement must keep structure closed and stable. Members connect node_3 to node_1, node_2, node_4 already. Node_3 at y=1.8 balances load distribution and reduces max compressive stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and expected stress reduction by raising node_3 to y=1.8. Member lengths increase moderately, mass increases slightly but still below 30. Stress in member_5 and member_4 expected to reduce due to better load path.",\n  "calculation": "New node_3 position: (2.0, 1.8). Member lengths: m5 (node_3-node_1): sqrt((2-0)^2 + (1.8-0)^2) = sqrt(4 + 3.24) = 2.69; m4 (node_3-node_4): sqrt((2-2)^2 + (1.8-3)^2) = 1.2; m6 (node_3-node_2): sqrt((2-6)^2 + (1.8-0)^2) = sqrt(16 + 3.24) = 4.23.
