Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_3 can move vertically or horizontally to optimize stress distribution.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max compressive stress is -9.54 at member_5 (node_3-node_1). This member is short and heavily loaded. Member_4 (node_3-node_4) also high compressive stress -9.04. Both connected to node_3, which is on the base line now at (2,0). Moving node_3 upward along vertical line could reduce compression in these members by changing geometry. Also member_6 (node_3-node_2) low stress. Adjusting node_3 y-coordinate upwards will increase triangle area and reduce stress concentrations. Member areas are uniform at \'2\' now; can consider reducing area for low stress members to reduce mass but priority is stress minimization first. Node_1 and node_2 fixed due to supports, node_4 fixed due to no instruction to move. Only node_3 movable.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try moving node_3 from y=0 to y=1.5 or 2.0 to reduce compressive stress in members connected to it. Check impact on mass and stress. Keep all members connected to maintain closed truss.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "By raising node_3 vertically, members_5 and 4 lengthen, reducing force per unit area and stress. This also redistributes load path improving stress balance. Member_1 (node_1-node_2) and member_2 (node_2-node_4), member_3 (node_4-node_1) form the main triangle and remain fixed. Member_6 (node_3-node_2) lengthens slightly, reducing stress. Area assignments remain at \'2\' for uniformity and simplicity, maintaining mass below limit.

Member_4 (node_3-node_4): sqrt((2-2)^2 + (1.8-3)^2) = 1.2, previously 3.0, shorter but vertical displacement reduces stress. Member_6 (node_3-node_2): sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-1.8)^2) = sqrt(16 + 3.24) = sqrt(19.24) ≈ 4.39, previously 4.0. Increased length reduces axial stress.
