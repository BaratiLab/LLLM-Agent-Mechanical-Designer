Need to reduce member stresses and mass by redesign and re-area sizing.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has max stress ~52 MPa (limit ±15 MPa) and mass ~37.5 (limit 30). Members with area 4 (3.128) and 1 (0.195) used unevenly, causing overstress. The structure topology is complex with node_6 added, increasing mass and stress concentration. Members from node_3 to node_4 and node_4 to node_6 show high stress. The load at node_3 is close to supports, so a simpler truss with direct load path and fewer long members can reduce mass and stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_6 to reduce complexity and mass. Use a triangular truss with nodes 1, 2, 3, 4 only. Node_4 elevated to 3.0m as before. Use members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_3-node_2 to triangulate. Select areas to keep stress ≤15 and mass ≤30. Use larger areas in compression members, smaller in tension. Optimize node_3 position slightly for load path.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Propose 4 nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2.5,0), node_4(2.5,3).

This forms a stable truss with good load transfer, reduced mass and stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular truss is efficient for load transfer. Moving node_3 slightly closer to center balances load path. Larger cross-section in compression members (member_2) reduces stress. Smaller areas in tension members saves mass.

Mass = sum(length*area). Check stress estimates: compression members get larger area. Total mass ~ (2.5*1.759)+(3*4.887)+(3.54*0.782)+(3*0.195)+(3.54*0.195) ≈ 4.4+14.66+2.77+0.59+0.69=23.1 <30.
