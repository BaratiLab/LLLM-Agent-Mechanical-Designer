Supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller. Current max stress 52.38 > 15 limit. Mass 7.54 < 30 limit. Need to reduce stress by redesign or member sizing.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high compressive stress in member_1 (-52.38) and high tensile in member_4 (29.05). Members near load node_3 are overstressed. Member areas are uneven; largest area member_2 (area_id 2=0.782) still low. Structure shape is a triangle with a vertical node_4. Load at node_3 on bottom chord causes high stress concentration. To reduce stress, redistribute load paths by adding a node above node_3 to form a more stable triangular truss and increase member areas strategically.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add one node above node_3 at about (2.0, 4.0). Connect node_4 to new node_5 and node_3 to node_5. Use larger area for members connecting to load node and vertical members. Reduce area for less stressed members. This will reduce member_1 compressive stress and balance load paths.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (2.0, 4.0). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_4-node_1, node_2-node_4, node_5-node_4. Areas assigned to keep stress within ±15 and total mass ≤30. Areas chosen from catalog with larger areas on critical members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 above node_3 creates a truss with two triangles sharing node_5, improving load distribution. Members connected to node_3 and node_5 carry load in tension/compression reducing peak stresses. Increasing member areas on critical members reduces stress. Keeping mass under 30 is achievable given current mass 7.54 and moderate area increases.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_2 = 4.0, node_3-node_5 = 4.0, node_5-node_4 = 1.0, node_4-node_1 = ~3.605551, node_2-node_4 = ~6.708204, node_5-node_4 = 1.0.
