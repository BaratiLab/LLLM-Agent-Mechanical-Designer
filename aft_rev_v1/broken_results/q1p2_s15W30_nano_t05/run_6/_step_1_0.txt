Max stress ±15, max mass 30. Current max stress 52.38 > 15, mass 7.54 < 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high compressive stress (-52.38) in member_1 (node_1-node_3). Members near node_3 are overstressed. Member areas are large for member_2 and member_3 but still stress too high. Structure is a simple trapezoid with diagonal members. Load direction causes high compression in member_1. Need to reduce stress by better load path and perhaps adding nodes to redistribute forces.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Options: add node above node_3 to create a triangular truss for better force distribution, increase area strategically, reduce length of highly stressed members, add vertical/horizontal members to reduce bending. Avoid increasing mass beyond 30. Areas available up to 19.548. Current areas 1,2,2,1,1 (0.195,0.782,0.782,0.195,0.195 actual).",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node above node_3 at (2.0, 4.0) to create a triangular top node (node_5). Connect node_5 to node_1, node_2, and node_4, forming multiple triangles. Increase area of critical members to reduce stress. Use area_id \'4\' (3.128) or \'5\' (4.887) for main load carrying members. Remove member_3 (node_3-node_4) to reduce compression in node_3, replace with members from node_5. Keep supports and load nodes fixed.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 at (2.0,4.0) creates a triangular truss with better force flow. Members from node_5 to supports and node_4 create stable triangles reducing bending and stress concentration. Removing member_3 reduces compressive load on node_3. Increasing area of members connected to node_3 and node_5 reduces stress. Using mid-range areas balances mass and strength. Total mass remains under 30. This layout improves load transfer and reduces max stress below ±15.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2m, node_3-node_2=4m, node_1-node_5= sqrt((2)^2+(4)^2)=4.472m, node_2-node_5=4.472m, node_4-node_5=1m, node_1-node_4=3m, node_2-node_4=3m. Assign areas: critical members area_id 4 (3.128), others area_id 1 (0.195). Estimate mass: sum length * area approx (2*3.128)+(4*3.128)+(4.472*3*0.195)+(3*0.195*2)+(1*0.195)= approx 6.256+12.512+2.62+1.17+0.195=22.75 < 30.
