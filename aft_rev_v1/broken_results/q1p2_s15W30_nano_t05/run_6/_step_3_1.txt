Constraints: max stress ±15, max mass 30. Current design exceeds both.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high max stress (52.38 > 15) and mass (37.48 > 30). Members with highest stress are member_1 (-52.38) and member_3 (50.45). Large areas on long members increase mass. Structure is complex with overlapping members causing inefficient load paths. Load at node_3 near base causes large bending and tension/compression in members near node_1 and node_4. Current node_6 placement (3.0, 3.5) is not optimal for force distribution. Need simpler, more direct load paths and smaller cross sections.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce member lengths and areas of high-stress members. Add a new node above node_3 to form a triangular truss for better load transfer. Remove redundant members. Use smaller areas on compression/tension members. Aim for direct load paths from node_3 to supports.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (2.0, 4.0) above node_3. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_3-node_4. Remove node_6 and members connected to it. Assign areas to keep stress ≤15 and mass ≤30: use area_id \'2\' or \'3\' for longer members and \'1\' for shorter members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular geometry with node_5 above node_3 creates stable load path transferring load vertically and laterally. Removing node_6 reduces complexity and mass. Using moderate areas balances stress and mass. Members from node_3 to node_5 and node_5 to node_4 carry load in tension/compression efficiently. Base members support horizontal reaction forces. This configuration should reduce max stress and mass within limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approx: node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_5 = 1.0, node_5-node_4 = 1.0, node_4-node_2 = sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-3)^2)=5.0, node_1-node_4=3.6, node_3-node_4=3.0. Assign area_id \'2\' (0.782) for longer members, \'1\' (0.195) for shorter. Estimated mass = sum(length*area) ≈ 2*0.195 + 1*0.195 + 1*0.195 + 5*0.782 + 3.6*0.782 + 3*0.782 ≈ 0.39+0.195+0.195+3.91+2.82+2.35=9.86 <30.
