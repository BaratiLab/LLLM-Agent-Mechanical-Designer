Max stress ±15, max mass 30. Current design mass 31.996 > 30, max stress 5.8 < 15 (OK). Need to reduce mass below 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has 4 nodes (2 supports fixed), 5 members with areas mostly large (2 to 4). Mass slightly above limit due to thick members (areas 3,4). Stress is safe. Node_3 is between supports on bottom chord, node_4 at (2,3). Members form a basic truss with a triangle at left and right. To reduce mass, reduce member areas or lengths, or remove redundant members. Node_3 at (2,0) is close to node_1 (0,0) and node_2 (6,0). Possibly remove node_3 and form direct members from node_1 to node_4 and node_2 to node_4 to reduce member count and mass. Or move node_4 slightly to optimize geometry. Keep load and supports fixed. Use smaller areas where possible without exceeding stress limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Removing node_3 simplifies structure, but need to check if load transfer is effective. Alternatively, keep node_3 but reduce member areas and adjust node_4 position to reduce member lengths and mass. Use areas 2 or 1 on bottom chords and 3 or 2 on diagonals. Check lengths and stresses accordingly.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_3 to simplify. Use nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_4(3.0,3.0) (moved slightly right for symmetry). Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_2 (bottom chord). Areas: bottom chord smaller area (1 or 2), diagonals moderate area (3). Load at node_3 removed, so apply load at node_4 instead (since node_3 removed). Alternatively, keep node_3 but move it to (3.0, 0), align with node_4 at (3.0,3.0) to form a simple vertical member and reduce length. Then members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2. Use smaller areas to reduce mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing node_3 is not allowed since load is applied there. So keep node_3 at (3.0, 0.0) to reduce member lengths. Move node_4 to (3.0, 3.0) for vertical member above node_3. Bottom chord members node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2 have length 3m each, vertical member node_3-node_4 length 3m, diagonals node_1-node_4 and node_4-node_2 length approx 3.6m. Assign areas: bottom chord area 2 (0.782), vertical member area 3 (1.759), diagonals area 2 (0.782). This reduces mass and keeps stresses low due to shorter members and moderate areas.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: node_1-node_3 = 3m, node_3-node_2=3m, node_3-node_4=3m, node_1-node_4=√(3²+3²)=4.2426m, node_4-node_2=√(3²+3²)=4.2426m. Member masses = length * area. Sum mass: (3*0.782)*2 + 3*1.759 + 4.2426*0.782*2 = 4.692 + 5.277 + 6.636 = 16.6 approx, well below 30. Stresses expected to be below limit due to reduced lengths and moderate areas.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Mass calculation: member_1 (node_1-node_3): 3*0.782=2.346, member_2 (node_3-node_2): 3*0.782=2.346, member_3 (node_3-node_4): 3*1.759=5.277, member_4 (node_1-node_4): 4.2426*0.782=3.318, member_5 (node_4-node_2): 4.2426*0.782=3.318.
