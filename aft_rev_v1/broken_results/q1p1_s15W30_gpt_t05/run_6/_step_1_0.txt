Stress is main issue. Members with high stress: member_6 (-36.26), member_4 (27.84), member_5 (18.36). Areas currently 0 or 1 mostly; must increase areas in high stress members or redesign to reduce stress.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure is a simple 4-node truss with a horizontal base and one node elevated at (2, 3.5). Load at node_3 (-10N at -45°) causes high stress in diagonal members connected to node_4. Member_6 (node_4-node_3) is overstressed in compression (-36.26). The base member_1 (node_1-node_2) has low stress (-4.23). Members between node_1, node_2, and node_3 are low stress. The triangular shape is insufficient to resist load within stress limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, increase cross-sectional areas on high stress members or add nodes to better distribute load. Moving node_4 upward or adding an intermediate node may reduce stress. Avoid increasing areas too much to keep mass low. Possibly remove member_5 if it is less effective or adjust its area. Maintain supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller).",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add one new node (node_5) between node_3 and node_4 vertically to reduce length and stress in member_6. Adjust member areas: increase area of member_6 and member_4 to area \'3\' (1.759), and member_5 to area \'2\' (0.782). Keep base members smaller (area \'1\' or \'0\'). Members: connect node_1-node_3, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_4-node_1, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_2. This creates a stiffer, better distributed structure.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 reduces long diagonal member length and stress concentration on member_6. Increasing areas on critical members reduces stress. Keeping base members smaller saves mass. The new member connections form smaller triangles, improving load path and reducing max stress. The total mass remains under 30 given moderate area increases and limited new members.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_5 placed at (2.0, 2.0) between node_3 (2,0) and node_4 (2,3.5). Member lengths: node_3-node_5 = 2.0m, node_5-node_4 = 1.5m. Member_6 split into two shorter members with less stress. Areas chosen: member_6 and member_4 at 1.759, member_5 at 0.782, others at 0.195 or 1.
