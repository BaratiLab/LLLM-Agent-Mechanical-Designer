Node_3 and node_4 can be moved. Members have uniform area_id=2.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress is close to limit in member_1 (-13.06). Load at node_3 pulls downward-left, causing high compression in member_1. Member_5 also has significant compression (-9.04). Mass is low, so area sizing can be adjusted. Current geometry has node_4 at (2,3) causing relatively high stress in members connected to it. Moving node_4 and node_3 slightly upward and right may reduce compression in member_1 and balance forces. Also, consider reducing area in low-stress members to reduce mass or increase area in high-stress members to reduce stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_3 is load node, fixed at x=2.0, y=0.0 currently. We can move node_3 vertically only. Node_4 can be moved freely. Members: 1,2 connect node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2; 3,4 connect node_1-node_4 and node_4-node_2; 5 connects node_3-node_4. Consider moving node_4 upward and right to reduce member_1 compression, possibly raise node_3 slightly to share load better.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing height of node_4 increases vertical stiffness, reducing bending moment on node_3. Raising node_3 slightly reduces compression in member_1. Adjust member areas selectively: increase area in member_1 and member_5 to reduce stress, decrease in low-stress members to keep mass under limit. Area_id=3 (1.759) or 4 (3.128) for high-stress members, area_id=1 (0.195) for low-stress. Maintain closed truss with 5 members. Node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_3 y can be raised from 0 to ~0.5.

Increasing node_4 y increases m3 and m4 length, increasing mass but may reduce stress. Balance needed. Use area_id 3 (1.759) for members 1 and 5, area_id 1 (0.195) for members 2,3,4.

Stress reduction expected in members 1 and 5 due to increased area and slightly increased length, stress in member_1 reduces from -13.06 to ~ -10, member_5 from -9.04 to ~ -7.
