Constraints: |stress| ≤ 15, total mass ≤ 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design fails due to member_2 overstressed (-38.28 < -15). Total mass 11.4155 is acceptable. Members with area \'1\' and \'2\' used. Node_3 is between supports on baseline, node_4 above forming a triangle. Member_2 (node_1-node_3) overstressed likely due to load transfer and geometry.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce stress by adding more load paths or adjusting geometry. Possibly add a node above node_3 to better distribute load. Increase cross-section area selectively to reduce stress. Avoid increasing mass beyond 30.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node (node_5) above node_3 at (2.0, 4.0) to create a stronger triangular bracing. Remove member_2 (node_1-node_3) which is overstressed. Add members connecting node_5 to node_1, node_2, and node_3. Use larger area for critical members to reduce stress, smaller for others to reduce mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 above node_3 creates a truss apex to better carry load from node_3. Removing overstressed member_2 and redistributing forces through new members reduces stress concentration. Using area \'3\' (1.759) for new vertical and diagonal members balances stress and mass. Keep baseline members with area \'1\' (0.195) or \'2\' (0.782) to reduce mass where stress is low.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_1-node_5 ≈ 4.472, node_2-node_5 ≈ 4.472, node_3-node_5 = 1.0. Assign areas to keep stress ≤ 15. Calculate approximate mass = sum(length × area). Verify total mass < 30.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Baseline members: node_1-node_2 length=6.0, area=1 (0.195), mass=6×0.195=1.17. Members node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2 length=2.0 each, area=1 (0.195), mass=2×0.195=0.39 each. New members: node_3-node_5 length=1.0, area=3 (1.759), mass=1×1.759=1.759; node_1-node_5 and node_2-node_5 length=4.472, area=3 (1.759), mass=4.472×1.759=7.86 each. Total mass approx 1.17 + 0.39×2 + 1.759 + 7.86×2 = 1.17 + 0.78 + 1.759 + 15.72 = 19.429 < 30. Stress should reduce due to load redistribution.
