To form a closed truss, we must add at least one more node off the line to create a triangle or polygon. Since no new nodes allowed, closed truss means all nodes connected pairwise forming a triangle: node_1-node_2, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_1. This triangle is minimal closed shape. Load at node_3 downward-left requires members sized to keep stress ≤15. Supports at ends provide boundary conditions.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Closed truss with 3 nodes is a triangle.
