Mass increased from last iteration signaling heavy area 5 on member_5. Moving node_4 closer to line between nodes 1 and 2 may reduce member_4 stress and balance internal force distribution. Reducing area on member_5 might help mass but risk increasing stress; thus balanced reposition needed.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_4 connects node_2 to node_4 (roller support). High stress implies relative placement gives large bending/shear forces. Member_5 with largest area likely compensates for triangulation at node_4. Shift node_4 slightly downward and toward node_3 to reduce force in member_4. Adjust member_3 or member_5 areas accordingly.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Shift node_4 horizontally closer to node_3 (from 3.3 to ~3.0 for x) and vertically from 2.3 down to ~1.9 to reduce moment arm increasing tension in member_4. Keep member connections unchanged to preserve closure. Keep areas same except lower member_5 from \'5\'->\'4\' area to reduce mass while maintaining structural integrity.
