No nodes at load and support can be moved. Current node_3 and node_4 positions well-balanced for force distribution. Member areas are assigned to control stress; areas are relatively low preventing excess mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Moving internal nodes could reduce stress but risk higher stress elsewhere or mass increase. Load node_3 fixed at (2,0), support nodes fixed at (0,0) and (6,0). Node_4 vertical position at 3 optimizes force flow. Minimizing max stress below current 20.15 may not be cost-effective given the constraints.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Max stress within ±30 allows margin but node displacement limit (nodes with load/support fixed) restricts geometry optimization. The truss is minimally indeterminate, with direct load path nodes and diagonal bracing. Reducing area of high stress member_4 may cause stress overload, increasing area increases mass beyond limit. Current design balances area and member size effectively. Further area tuning unlikely to reduce max stress significantly while respecting mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Areas from set {0-10} chosen to keep member_4 minimal area 1; members with lower stresses use suitably smaller areas balancing mass. Nodes 3 and 4 positioned to achieve near optimal force flow. Small shifts in node_4 vertical position may increase stress elsewhere.",\n\n  "calculation": "Stress(max)=20.1455 <30 constraint met.
