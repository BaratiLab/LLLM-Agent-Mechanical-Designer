Current max stress ~17, total mass ~21.8. Load at node_3, supports fixed as per instructions.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design meets constraints with large mass and stress far below limit. Better shape may redistribute forces more evenly and allow smaller cross-sections. node_5 at (2.5,1.5) can be optimized to reduce member_4 stress (17.094, highest tensile). Next largest stresses member_2 (-12.087), member_7 (-5.53). Member_4 area is smallest (0.195), which causes high stress. Increasing area somewhat for member_4 or reducing its force by node_5 reposition could help. node_3 is fixed at load, node_1 and node_2 are supports, node_4 can move but better keep near the load path.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try lowering node_5 closer towards node_4 and node_3 line to reduce member_4 load. Slight move down to decrease tensile force while increasing from compression on members_1 and 3 is acceptable. Rebalance cross-sections: member_4 area from 1 to 2, reduce member_1 slightly to compensate, member_6 and member_7 area adjusted to 1 to lower mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Minimizing max stress by repositioning node_5 closer to centroid of members 3,4,5 reduces axial forces in high-stress members. By increasing member_4 area one step (area \'2\' = 0.782) the stress reduces proportionally near allowable limit for safety and stress margin. Simultaneously reduce member_1 area so total mass stays under 30. Members with very low stress allocated smaller area for mass reduction. Positioning node_5 at optimized coordinate balancing axial lengths reduces stress concentration. Network remains closed with existing members.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate node_5 new coordinate coordinates: current (2.5,1.5). Move to (2.57,1.25). Member lengths re-approx: m4 shorter, m6, m7 marginally change. Adjust areas member_4:(2), member_1:(3), member_6 & 7:(1). Total mass check ~22.5 less than 30. Estimate max stress reduction in member_4 to ~12 smaller by ~30%. Members others slightly adjusted, max <17 continue safe.",\n\n  "calculation": "New node_5: (2.57, 1.25).
