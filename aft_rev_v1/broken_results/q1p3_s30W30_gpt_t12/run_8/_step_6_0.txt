Design stable and feasible.",\n  "analysis": "Stress is minimized effectively, no members near stress limits. Member areas sized reasonably. Geometry forms a stable closed truss with efficient load distribution. Minor repositioning nodes could marginally reduce stress; however, impact is very limited given current low stress levels.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Changing node positions except loads/supports risks increasing stresses or complexity. Current member layout provides a good balance of tension and compression.",\n  "reasoning": "Max stress well within limits; further reducing stress would require larger masses thus heavier structure. Mass limit is not tight but current mass is still moderate. All constraints met with comfortable margin. Trying to reduce max stress more may tradeoff mass increase or stability.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Both load-bearing members and diagonals handle stress well. Node_6 addition stabilizes structure with limited member sizes. Current areas and node geometry near optimal within constraints.",\n  "calculation": "Total mass = sum member lengths × area indices values (matched 25.14). Max stress = 6.93 < 30.
