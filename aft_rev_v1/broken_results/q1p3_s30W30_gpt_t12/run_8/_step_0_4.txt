Problem: add nodes and members to form closed truss and distribute forces to meet stress and mass constraints.",\n\n    "analysis": "Given only three nodes all on x-axis,0 y, truss is colinear and thus unstable and can\'t form closed structure. Need to add at least one node above nodes 1, 2, or between to create area (triangle or quadrilateral). Load is at node_3 (x=2) downward-left direction magnitude 10 N at 45°. Reactions at pinned and roller supports. To control stress and mass, areas must be chosen to balance force distribution. Maximum mass allowed 30, mass=sum(member length × area_i). Assume members take axial loads only. Stress = Force / area. Use rated areas,{0:1 to 10:19.548}. Optimize member topology (triangular likely minimum). Node position designs can be any floats, must not change existing node coordinates.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 above line to form triangle with node_1 and node_2 or between node_2 and node_3 to reduce max length. Connect members to close truss and transfer load. Preview member lengths, attempt to minimize length to save mass. Stress checks for each member from approximated axial force considering static equilibrium. Added areas based on proportional stress safety. Also consider load path from node_3 to supports.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Adding one node, say node_4 with positive y to make triangle node_1-node_4-node_2 closes triangle (closed truss). Connect node_3 to node_4 or node_1/2 to form triangulated structure transferring load. Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_2, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_4. Approximate member lengths using distance formula. Assume static load path: force from node_3 distributes to supports via members; calculate forces by resolving equilibrium equations. Select areas so stresses = force/area ≤ 30 units. Mass=sum(length×area) ≤30. We try to minimize heavy areas and excessive member lengths. Preliminary guess: areas mostly between 1-4, some members carrying less load area=1 or 0.195., major members edge members get area like 3 or 4 (1.759,3.128).",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths L for proposed members; list members below.
