Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Initial max stress 48.35 > 30 allowed, total mass 16.13 < 30, so primary issue is stress. Current areas (1,2,3) lead to high stress in member_1 (compressive).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_1 excessive compressive stress (-48.35 > -30) suggests it is undersized or too slender. Other members are within stress limits. Overall mass is below limit, capacity to increase member area selectively. Node_3 at middle lower edge under load, supported ends at node_1 and node_2 along support line y=0. Node_4 is upper joint at (2,4). Current design is a simple trapezoidal truss but member_1 too small area (0.195) yields high stress.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Strategy: increase area in high compressive members or change geometry to reduce compressive loads. Also consider changing geometry by re-positioning or adding node to reduce member stresses. Cannot move node_1,node_2,node_3 or support nodes due to constraints. Could add a new node near load to better distribute stresses. Also reduce area in under-stressed members to keep total mass less than 30.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 above node_3 to form dual triangle topology better load distribution. Increase area of member_1 and newly added members appropriately to reduce stress. Remove member_5 (diagonal node_3 to node_4) to simplify load path and reduce tension in less needed members. Maintain support nodes and loads. Remove or reduce member_5 to reduce length×area mass associated with 7.036.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 vertically above node_3 creates better triangular bracing dividing load, reducing compressive force on member_1 via load path through node_5 to top node_4 to node_1 and node_2. Increasing area of member_1 and adjacent members balances stress. Removing member_5 lowers excessive mass there. Areas chosen from available discrete set. Length×area mass recalculated to keep total ≤ 30. Selecting higher areas only where stress critical helps mass control.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: member_1: node_1(0,0) to node_3(2,0)=2m, member_2: node_3 to node_2(6,0)=4m, member_3: node_1 to node_4(2,4)=sqrt(2^2+4^2)=4.472m; member_4: node_2 to node_4= sqrt(4^2+4^2)=5.657, member_5 removed. New member_5: node_3(2,0) to node_5(2,2.5): length=2.5m; member_6: node_5 to node_4 length=1.5m. Area assignment per member based on stress demand: member_1 area=6 (7.037), member_5 and member_6 area=3 (1.759), others reduced to 2 (0.782) if stress permits to save mass.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Estimate stresses reduce by triangulation; member_1 expected max compressive stress divided by 2 by new member.
