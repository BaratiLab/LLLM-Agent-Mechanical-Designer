The truss can be a triangle by adding a diagonal member between node_2 and node_3 or node_1 and node_3. Check forces for tension/compression and minimal total length × cross-section area sum.

Members have lengths and unit vectors allowing axial force calculation. Axial forces checked, then areas selected from set to keep stress ≤30 (stress = force / area). Also total mass: sum of lengths × areas ≤30.
