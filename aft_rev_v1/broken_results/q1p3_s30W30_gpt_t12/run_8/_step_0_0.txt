Load at node_3 with supports at ends requires that (3) be supported through members with appropriate axial area to keep stress <= 30. Member forces resolved by static equilibrium: sum force x and y at node_3. Use standard member force formula with approx assumptions: axial force = load projected / sin or cos of angles. Then compute stress = force / (area). Force proportional to anticipated stress; pick areas large enough to maintain stress limits and sized minimally to keep mass <=30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculations assume linear elastic axial stress states only.
