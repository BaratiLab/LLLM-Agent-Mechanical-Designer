Constraints: max stress ±30, max mass 30 (area × length), areas discrete from set.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Degree of freedom: since node_3 is loaded and lies between node_1 and node_2, truss must be closed — must connect all nodes, adding at least one member from node_3 to supplement. Currently, nodes colinear on x-axis, this is critical for stress. To stabilize out of plane/buckling, we add node lower or upper node to create 2D triangle or a quadrilateral with one extra node to stay closed. Adding one node to create triangular shape allows better force distribution, reduce stress. However, new node not allowed; so truss must be closed with existing 3 nodes only. Given constraint 5: No node position changes for existing nodes, assume members can be made between nodes forming a triangle: member_1: (node_1-node_3), member_2: (node_3-node_2), member_3: (node_1-node_2). Mass and stress will depend on area selection. Optimal design minimizes stress via diagonals handling load directly, forces balance by triangulation.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Three member triangle, direct load transfer from node_3. Better to allocate area sizes to members subject to max stress ±30 and mass ≤30. Longer members likely have smaller area. member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2m, node_3-node_2 = 4m, node_1-node_2 =6m.

Load of -10 at 45° on node_3 implies force can be decomposed to Fx= -10*cos45= -7.071, Fy= -7.071 downward and leftwards. Supports provide vertical and horizontal reactions. Triangulation divides forces evenly so axial stress remains in bounds. Calculate member axial forces via static equilibrium at node_3 on x and y directions. Since right side bearing (roller) only vertical reaction, left (pinned) both UX,UY.

Approximate forces: axial forces act along members. Assume linear-member forces throughout using static equilibrium. Reaction at node_1: R1x, R1y; node_2: R2y; load at node_3. Sum Fx=0 => R1x + F13x (+ other) = 0 sum Fy=0 similarly. Member forces calculable via geometry (angles between nodes), use cosine laws. Areas selected inversely proportional to member force to keep stress ≤30. Mass calculation sum(length*area) must be ≤30.
