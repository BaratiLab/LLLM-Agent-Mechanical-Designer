Members 1 and 2 under compression with moderate stress. To reduce stress magnitude, enhancing load transfer by repositioning node_4 and slightly repositioning node_3 without altering load/support nodes may reduce lever arm effects causing high local stresses. Increasing member areas is constrained by mass limit but since usage is low concern, can upscale areas for high stress members carefully coupled with geometry refinement.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_3 at (2,0) can be shifted horizontally within limits while keeping it on base line (since load applied here) to redistribute forces. Node_4 at (2,3) can be moved vertically or horizontally to optimize geometry. Keep closed truss topology with 5 members connecting same nodes.

Moving node_4 upward increases length members 3 and 4, possibly reducing stress in bottom chords normalized stress due to better force angles. Shifting node_3 toward node_2 slightly redistributes force, reducing compression in member_1.
