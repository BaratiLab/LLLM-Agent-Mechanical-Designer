Objective: closed truss, min stress ≤ ±30, mass ≤ 30, fixed node positions, selected cross-sectional areas from discrete set.",\n    \n    "analysis": "With nodes colinear on x-axis at (0,0), (2,0), and (6,0), adding an extra node elevated to form a triangle can reduce bending and generate a closed truss. Load (-10, -45°) corresponds to components approx. Fx=-7.07, Fy=-7.07 at node_3, causing tension/compression in members. Supports at node_1 pinned (restrains translation and rotation), node_2 roller (restrains vertical translation). Members connecting nodes 1-2, 1-3, 2-3 form a closed triangle for load transfer. Need cross-sectional areas per member to regulate stress ≤ 30 and minimize mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Add fourth node elevated above x-axis near node_3 for better load distribution? However, cannot move given nodes. Using only nodes 1,2,3, truss is closed. Check simple triangular truss 1-2, 2-3, 3-1 with areas adjusted for stress and mass constraints.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangular truss is shortest closed structure with minimal mass. Calculated member lengths: L_1-2=6m, L_1-3=2m, L_2-3=4m. Split load at node_3 into components for member stress approximation. Use linear axial force relations from basic truss statics approximated here. Choosing larger area on heavily loaded members and smaller area on less loaded helps stay under stress limit. Use stress = Force / (Area × material factor) assumed linear for simplicity (unit unknown), area selected from discrete options and member length considered for mass calculation (mass = length × area_id assuming density 1).",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Stress_max ≤ 30, mass_max ≤ 30. Lengths: L_1-2=6, L_1-3=2, L_2-3=4. Total mass = Σ length×area_id. Assign approximate forces: node_3 loaded; force in member 1-3 approx equals load Fx component (tension), 2-3 transfers Fy component (compression), manage member 1-2 for equilibrium reaction forces. Areas: assign 4 (3.128), 2 (0.782), 3 (1.759) for members for balanced stress/mass. Approximate stress = Force / Area (biggest force on 1-3 with 3.128 area reduces stress below 30).",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths: 1-2=6, 1-3=2, 2-3=4.
