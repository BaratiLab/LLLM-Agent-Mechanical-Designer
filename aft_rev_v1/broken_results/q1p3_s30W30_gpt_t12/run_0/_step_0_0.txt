Supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller). Objective: Closed truss => all nodes connected and member loops formed. Constraints on max stress ±30 and mass ≤30 with discrete cross-sectional areas. Need to add extra nodes only if necessary, avoid moves in node positions. Use approximations to estimate stress and mass. Area selections from given discrete values.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Only 3 nodes now: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), and node_3(2,0). These 3 lie colinearly on x-axis edge; no initial vertical member exists. Load applied at node_3 at magnitude 10, angle -45° (down and to left). To form a closed truss, we must have at least a triangular configuration. Current nodes are colinear; members between node_1-node_2, node_1-node_3, and node_2-node_3 form line segments only. A triangle with non-zero area requires a node off the line or creating a node on y-axis off current 3 nodes. To create structural stability and enable load paths, add one node with y > 0 or y < 0, e.g., node_4 at (2, h) for some h (height). This creates a triangle with node_1, node_2, node_4 creating a vertical component to resist load at node_3. Connect node_3 also to new node_4 for triangulation and stress distribution. Add members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4. Close the loop with members node_1-node_3 and node_2-node_3. Total 6 members, closed polygon. Resolving load path and stress distribution possible.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Must check masses: lengths × area must sum below 30. Estimating member lengths and stressing that included area for vertical members is sufficient but minimal. For loads assumed linear axial forces, estimation based on simple statics. Stress ≤ 30, so choose areas for members based on force / allowable stress. Keep area small if force is low; increase for those transferring major forces.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "1. Create node_4 at (2, 3.0) to enable good height for triangular support (chosen 3.0 to balance stiffness with mass). 2. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2 (base line members), node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4 (upper sides of triangle), node_3-node_4 (diagonal tie). This ensures triangular closed loop formed at node_3. 3. Calculate member lengths: base members ~2m and 4m segments, sides calculated by Pythagoras. 4. Estimate forces from load magnitude 10 at node_3 angled -45°, decompose load to x and y components: Fx = -10*cos45= -7.07 left, Fy= -7.07 downward. 5. Use static equilibrium to estimate axial forces in members.(simple assumption: vertical components resisted by node_4 members, horizontal transmits left clamp for reaction at node_1). 6. Calculate needed area for each member force dividing by stress limit ≤30 to keep stress safe. 7. Sum all member lengths × assigned areas, map areas to closest allowable standard areas from set while keeping total mass ≤ 30. 8. Verify maximum member stress ≤ ±30. 9. Confirm all nodes connected (closed structure).",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Forces: F = 10 @ -45°, Components Fx= -7.07 N, Fy = -7.07 N.
