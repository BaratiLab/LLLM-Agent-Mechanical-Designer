Current design max stress ~70 exceed limit, mass slightly above 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current max stress in members is 70.43, above ±20 allowed. Mass is 30.11, just above limit. Large tensile stress in member_4 connecting node_4 to node_1 likely due to long diagonal member. Also, presence of large cross-section areas (e.g., area 4 for member_1) causes mass penalty. The load is on node_3 at (-10 N, -45°), supported by node_1 pinned and node_2 roller at ground. Current node layout has nodes 1,2 fixed, node_3 at midspan bottom, nodes 4 and 5 above. Overly stressed member_4 and member_5 indicate poor load path. To reduce stress and mass, simplify the structure, reduce large members or area, and lengthen or position nodes for better force distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Relax areas on low-stress members, reduce overload from member_4 by rearranging upper nodes. Consider symmetric configuration with 2 nodes above base line, connected triangularly to support bottom nodes and loaded node. Possibly remove node_5 (loads spread triangle easier).",\n  \n  "proposal": "Use a simpler truss with nodes: node_1 (0,0) pinned, node_2 (6,0) roller, node_3 (2,0) load, node_4 (1.8,2.8), node_5 (3.8,2.8). Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_3-node_5, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2. Assign areas based on anticipated stress spatially increasing in bottom chord and diagonals. Use moderate areas from 1 to 3 for members under load, smaller areas (1 or 0.195) for the tension smaller members as possible. Ensure no highly stressed member exists, and total mass ≤ 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "A butterfly-like truss with two upper nodes distributes the load well, reducing high tension/compression spikes in diagonals. Adding node_5 laterally offers alternate load transfer to roller support. Removing unnecessary large members and lowering area on lightly stressed members reduces mass. Assigning small areas on bottom chords will keep mass under limit while ensuring stresses within bounds.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths computed roughly: bottom chord sides 1-3=2, 3-2=4, left and right diagonals roughly ~3.2-3.9; top chord 4-5=2.
