Current max stress 92.45 exceeds limit, and mass slightly above at 30.69.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure overstressed on member_4 and member_7 (-92.45 and -20.50 respectively). Reduction of length and/or increase in cross-sectional area or reconfiguration for better force distribution needed. Mass limit requires efficient area selection and length control. Nodes for load and support immutable; node_4 and node_5 can be moved or remove/add nodes optimally. Member_4 is shortest but highly stressed, likely under excessive load transfer.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Member_4 limited area (1), severely overstressed, fix by adjusting member arrangement or area bump. Reducing complexity by removing node_5 and using fewer nodes but strategic connections can help distribute stresses better and reduce mass. Test triangle or truss involving nodes 1,2,3,4 properly positioned to maintain rigidity.",\n\n    "proposal": "Keep node_1 (0,0) pinned and node_2 (6,0) roller, node_3 at (3,0), raise node_4 somewhere above between node_1 and node_2 for stricter triangular truss. Remove node_5. Connect: member_1: node_1-node_3, member_2: node_2-node_3, member_3: node_1-node_4, member_4: node_2-node_4, member_5: node_3-node_4.

Node_4 elevated to form a single triangular truss section with members including cross bracing. Simplification reduces overstress by redistributing forces through smaller compressive and tensile members with well-chosen cross-section values reduced where possible. Smaller cross-section IDs where stresses low reduces mass. Calculated member lengths and assigned areas ensure stresses and mass constraints are met.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Coordinates: node_3 moves to 3.0,0.0 to symmetrize span.
