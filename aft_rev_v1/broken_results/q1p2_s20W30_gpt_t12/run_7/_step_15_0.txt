Mass 15.873 is under limit 30. Load at node_3 downward left (-10N, -45°). Supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller. Node_3 load node cannot be moved. Members #6 and #7 overstressed. Reduce stress by adding/reconfiguring members for load path clarity.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_7 (node_4-node_2) stress -45.4 is highly overstressed in tension. Member_6 (node_1-node_4) stress +27.4 tension also exceeds limits. Member_5 is slightly over limit -17.4 close to -20 allowable. Strategy: reinforce bottom chord span and add diagonal bracing to reduce vertical member stresses. Improve triangulation with added nodes near load path. Current layout missing optimal load transfer to supports under angled load at node_3.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider redistributing forces - lower diagonals taking tension, vertical members reduced in load. Area IDs mostly 1-3 used; avoid oversizing for mass control. Add short horizontal/diagonal members with small to medium area sections to offload tension/compression. Hold fixed nodes for supports, add 1-2 auxiliary nodes near load and midway in span for better triangulation. Replace overloaded members with multiple smaller members in parallel or retarget area assignments.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add new node_6 near middle span (3.0, 1.5) below node_4-5 line; connect it to node_3 and node_4 with diagonal members with moderate area 2-3. Also connect node_6 to node_1 with moderate-low area member 2 to relieve node_1 to node_4 member. Keep node_5 shifted slightly to balance forces. Adjust areas of members near overstress for strong yet mass-controlled carrying elements. Member connections to improve triangulation: remove overloaded member_7 (node_4-node_2) and add node_6, rework members joining node_2 with node_4 and node_6 for force path refinement.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_6 and redistributing members reduces load on node_4-node_2 member which was major overstressed. Diagonal from node_3 to node_6 and from node_6 to node_4 carries load more effectively. Node_1 to node_4 member area is increased modestly while adding alternate force path node_1-node_6. Members near load receive area upgrade cautiously. Removal of directly overstressed node_4-node_2 member replaced with node_6 nodal connectivity reduces local stress.
