Candidate solution: redistribute loads by altering geometry and member areas. Current design bottom chord too understressed compared to truss top chords carry less stress, implying unbalanced force flow. A more triangular stable truss is ideal. Node_3 is redundant on baseline, prone to buckling in compression. Adding a more elevated node above node_3 could help. Need to reduce area for highly stressed compression members or re-route force paths by member layout. Use higher area members only in compression zones close to stress limits. Ensure all bottom nodes keep supports.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Option 1 - move node_3 upward; option 2 - add node above node_3 to form triangular webbing with node_4; formulate new member connectivity to reduce stress concentration in member_1; select member areas judiciously for stress safety.

Changing member_1 to area 3 (1.759) supports compression safely near stress limit. Using a slightly smaller area for members expected in tension reduces mass. Keeping node_3 midway between nodes 1 and 2 horizontally creates symmetric force paths and stable triangular sections. The vertical member_5 with small area limits mass, as less stressed member.
