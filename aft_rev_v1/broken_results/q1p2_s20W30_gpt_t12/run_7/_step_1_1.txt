Current structure too stressed at member_1 (-52.38) and total mass 10.25.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current main issue is excessive stress (member_1 = -52.38 > -20) despite bearing load. Member_1 is short and lightly sized (area_id=1=0.195) resulting in high compressive stress. Members near node_4 mostly low stress max 7.25, so truss shape is inefficient. Mass is ok within limit. Solution requires redistributing loads, strengthening key members particularly near load node_3, and adding stiffness.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Potential to reduce member_1 stress by increasing area or rerouting forces via adding a node above node_3 and triangularize more efficiently, better pin connection between loaded nodes to spread compression and tension. Increase areas on high stress members; lower on low stressed members to save mass.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add one node above node_3 at (2.0, 4.5) to add a vertical member and two diagonals forming two triangles and triangular core. Upgrade member_1 area to \'3\' (1.759) to reduce stress. Keep members from supports to node_3 as baseline but adjust member_2 and 1 areas for optimal stress sharing. Members connecting new node to node_3 and node_4 as area \'2\' (0.782). Remove or reduce low stressed member areas for mass savings.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Adding vertical node adds stiffness and redistributes compression. Enlarging member_1 area reduces compressive stress. Using two triangles in top portion reduces bending, places mostly axial stresses. Areas balances stress-mass. Node placements fixed for supports-loads, added node above load improves force path.", \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: node1-node3=2, node2-node3=4, node3-node_new=1.5, new-node4=1.5 Vertices form two triangles: node1-node3-node_new and node2-node3-node_new spreads force. Max load 10N at node_3. Member forces scale with areas inversely ~stress_area=force/area.
