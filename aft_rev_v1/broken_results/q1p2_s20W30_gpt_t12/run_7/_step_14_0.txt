Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current design iteration 13 exceeds mass (32.05 > 30). Max stress acceptable (~9.69). Node_3 at 2.0,0.0 fixed; node_1 and node_2 fixed. Adjust geometry and member areas to reduce mass under 30 while ensuring stress < 20.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has excessive mass (~32). The primary mass contributors are members with area_id=3 (area=1.759) and members with lengths ~3.5 to 4.5 m. Max stress is low (~9.7), indicating potential area reduction. Concentrate on reducing cross-section area for less critical members and reposition redundant nodes slightly upward to improve force paths for lighter members. Members to consider for area reduction: member_2, member_6 (highest mass), and member_4. Node_6 seems auxiliary and placement could be optimized or node_6 could be removed to shorten truss and reduce mass without compromising stability. Maintain key triangular bracing paths for stability.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Options: reduce some area_ids from 3 to 2 or 1, reposition node_6 upward and closer to node_5/node_4, or remove node_6 and connect node_5 directly to node_4 and node_3 for simpler truss. Removing node_6 reduces number of members and mass. Members with zero stress (member_5, member_8) suggest redundancy; removing unnecessary members is beneficial. Mass formula sums length × area. Need area multipliers.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_6 fully. Keep nodes_1,2,3,4,5 fixed, adjust node_4 at (2.2, 3.9) and node_5 at (4.4, 2.8) to optimize length and force distribution. Members: node_1-node_3 (area 2), node_3-node_4 (area 2), node_4-node_5 (area 2), node_5-node_2 (area 2), node_3-node_5 (area 1), node_1-node_4 (area 1). Total of 6 members with reduced areas and concise triangled framework. This reduces member length and area and trims unnecessary elements.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Max stress was low, so cross-section trimmed safely. Removing node_6 reduces member number and total length. Raised node_4 slightly to improve angle against loads. Area_id=2 (0.782) for main tension members balances low mass and strength. Smaller area_id=1 (0.195) smaller members handles shear transfer member_3-node_5 and node_1-node_4. Stability maintained by three main force triangles: 1-3-4, 3-4-5, 5-2-4.
