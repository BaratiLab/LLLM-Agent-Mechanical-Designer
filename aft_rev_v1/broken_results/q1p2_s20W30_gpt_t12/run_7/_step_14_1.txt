Current design total mass 32.05 > 30, max stress 9.69 < 20 – mass is problem. node_1 and node_2 fixed as supports; load at node_3 with a 45° downward/left (-10N at -45°). Prior designs have 6 nodes but often exceed mass limit. We can remove node_6 to reduce complexity and mass. Use stiffer members with smaller areas where possible to reduce mass but keep safety. Consider shorter members and triangulated connections to distribute loads effectively. Avoid large area parameters that excessively add mass.",\n  "analysis": "Current design exceeded mass limit by ~2kg, max stress is safe. Members with area 3 cause bulk of mass; reducing some areas and trimming unnecessary nodes or members will reduce mass. Node_6 and associated members add mass but low stress. We can eliminate node_6. The core load path is support nodes 1 and 2, load at 3 elevated node 4 for vertical support, and intermediate node 5 for load distribution. Use areas with moderate size (e.g. area 2: 0.782 or area 3:1.759 where needed for compressive members) and smaller (area 1:0.195) for tension to save mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_6 and its members. Connect node_3 to node_4 and node_5; nodes 4 and 5 link to supports for triangulation. Keep members 1, 2, 3, 4 between supports and main nodes with minimized areas. Place nodes 4 and 5 to balance vertical load near load node 3 placement for less bending and thus less stress in members. Area sizing matches force expected in each member (1 for tension members with low force, 3 or 2 for compression). Estimate member lengths and total mass roughly to confirm under 30 aggregate. Replace large area members with smaller ones where stresses allow.",\n  "proposal": "Redesign with 5 nodes: node_1 (0,0) pinned, node_2 (6,0) roller, node_3 (2,0) load node, node_4 (2.2,4.0), node_5 (4.5,2.8).

By keeping triangulation (nodes 3,4,5) supported by nodes 1 and 2, structure distributes load effectively. Assigning appropriate member areas (1,2,3) balances stress capacity and mass. Node position selection offers vertical height to alleviate load stress in members. This truss shape has a stable geometry resisting load at node_3 in -45° direction. Member_6 as smaller area reduces mass while supporting node_4 vertical position. This design adheres to constraints with estimated total_mass ~29-30 and maximum stress within ±20.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Estimate member lengths: member_1: distance n1-n3 = 2; member_2: n3-n4 ≈ sqrt((2.2-2)^2+(4-0)^2)=4.0049; member_3: n4-n5 ≈ sqrt((4.5-2.2)^2+(2.8-4)^2)=2.796; member_4: n5-n2= sqrt((6-4.5)^2+(0-2.8)^2)=3.21; member_5: n3-n5= sqrt((4.5-2)^2+(2.8-0)^2)=4.927; member_6: n1-n4= sqrt((2.2-0)^2+4^2)=4.684; Using areas from mapping: \'1\' = 0.195, \'2\' = 0.782, \'3\' = 1.759; Mass = sum(length * area) close to sum(length*area) ~ 29.
