Current max stress ~324 is far too high, mass 19.37 is okay. Major stress violation at member_3 (-324) and member_5 (-76). Load at node_3 (-10N @ -45°). Need to improve load path and distribute forces with better geometry and area selection.",\n\n  "analysis": "High compressive stresses in members between node_5, node_4, node_2 and node_4, node_1; current small areas fail to support large stresses. Existing nodes cause stress concentrations. Excessive stress on member_3 (node_5-node_4) suggests that connectivity or area is insufficient. Members carrying compression need more cross section, tensile members thinner to save mass. Introducing an additional node between 3 and 4 or higher elevation nodes to better triangulate load path can reduce stress.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Strategy is to increase triangulation and redistribute load paths while keeping mass ≤ 30. Use thicker members in crucial compression members and optional node addition to break long compression members. Limit members to areas such that max stress ≤ 20 is achieved by member sections. Remove or reduce redundant members causing stress concentrations.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add a new node higher above node_5 to create more triangles; adjust members for distribution. Increase critical members\' area to higher permissible values. Remove overstressed members from prior layout.
