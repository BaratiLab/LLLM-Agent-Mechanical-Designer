Stress limit ±20 and max mass 30. Current iteration 22 design\'s max stress 31.13 (too high). Current mass 15.1 is acceptable below max 30. Need to reduce member max stress and possibly smaller areas in critical members. Preserve load/support nodes; may move/add intermediate nodes to improve truss force path. Reduce large compressive/tensile stresses, e.g. member_4 (-31) and member_8 (30+). Areas available are wide from 0:1 down to 10:19.548 - current areas mostly 1 to 3 range. Plan to add/shift nodes to re-balance.\n\n  "analysis": "The current 8-member structure is overweight in max stress (±31, exceeding 20 limit). The nodes are fixed on support/load positions. Stress is notably high in members directly connected to node_3 and node_6 (member_4 and member_8). Weighted area assignment with slight topology changes needed. A triangular main load path from node_1 to node_2 passing through node_4 (top middle) and intermediates can reduce bending and axial stress. Add intermediate nodes higher than current node_4 to create efficient load routes. Member cross-section adjustment to mostly area \'1\' or \'0\' (1 to 0.195) in less critical members and \'2\' or \'3\' in highly loaded younger. Remove low-stress heavy members and redistribute.\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Introduction of a new top node near the mid-span between node_3 and node_2, at a bigger height (~2.8), to shorten long members under high loading and distribute forces through multiple paths. Use lower areas in side-members. Use members with efficient load transfer mostly in triangles. Planned members: from node_1 and node_2 to new mid node, from node_3 and node_4 to mid node, smaller members for load path. Assembly in simpler, lighter format. Consider areas {\'0\':1, \'1\':0.195, \'2\':0.782, \'3\':1.759} to restrain mass."\n\n  "proposal": "Add one intermediate node \'node_7\' near (3.5, 2.8) positioned between nodes 3 and 2 at a significant height. Maintain nodes 1-6 as given except node_6 moved slightly upward (better geometry). Connect members in triangles: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_7, node_7-node_2, node_3-node_6, node_6-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_4-node_7, node_4-node_1, node_4-node_5, node_6-node_7 with selected cross-section areas adapting to force demands. Optimize member cross-sectional areas to stay below stress constraints and minimize mass. Aim for load path with triangles to share tension and compression evenly."\n\n  "reasoning": "Stress limit requires triangular stable load paths to minimize member length and force magnitude. Concentrated load at node_3 causes large stresses in members nearby; thus reorganize topology around it with node_7 as secondary support node. Minor vertical positioning to distribute forces evenly. Placement allows shorter compression members, minimizing critical buckling. Area selection focused on lowering cross-sectional areas where stresses allow but increase areas where required. Area \'3\'=1.759 sufficiently strong for compressive members, area \'1\'=0.195 and \'2\'=0.782 elsewhere to reduce mass. Estimated total mass remains well below 30, ensuring a balance. Previous designs with 7+ nodes with random topology failed constraints; a clearer load path and tighter geometry achieve compliance."\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate approximate member lengths and assign areas: \\\nNode positions fixed: \\\nnode_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(3,2.4), node_5(4,1.6), node_6(3.6,1.2), node_7(3.5,2.8). \\\nMembers: node_1-3, node_3-7, node_7-2, node_3-6, node_6-5, node_5-2, node_4-7, node_4-1, node_4-5, node_6-7. \\\nApprox lengths: \\\nm1: node_1-node_3 ~2.0, area 2 (0.782) mass ~1.56, estimated tension <20 MPa incr area if needed. \\\nm2: node_3-node_7 ~2.34, area 3(1.759), compression high load eased enough to limit stress. \\\nm3: node_7-node_2 ~3.2, area 3, similar tension focus. \\\nOthers areas lowering for mass.
