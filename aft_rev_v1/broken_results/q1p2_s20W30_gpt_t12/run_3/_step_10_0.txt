Max stress ±20, max total mass ≤30. Current mass 19.25 but max compressive stress -72.5 exceeding -20 limit.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Previous design uses many members with higher-cross sections but stress concentrates above limits esp. compressive on member_1 (-72.5238). Structure complex with 7 nodes including internal nodes near load zone. Members from lower area sections (1-3) for some small reads but stresses too high. No overload on mass though. Load pull leftward/downward on node_3 which is between supports node_1 (pinned at left) and node_2 (roller right). Members supporting load must redistribute forces to supports without over-stressing members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress concentration near node_3 is from long member_1 and related members. Some tension members have mild overstress but compressive are severe, especially shorter members near load. Reducing length or adjusting angles to reduce compression load needed. Area adjustments have limited effect due to member force magnitude. Need stronger truss action possibly by relocating internal nodes upwards and leftward of node_3 to better triangulate and share compression and tension.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Retain supports and load node positions. Remove some members causing stress spikes. Add extra internal nodes elevated and left-shifted to enable multiple load paths. New internal nodes node_8 and node_9 strategically above node_3 for bracing. Connect node_3 to node_8 and node_9, node_8 and node_9 to node_4, node_4 to node_2, node_1 to node_8 and node_9. Optimize areas with mostly 1~3 area ids to reduce mass but allow higher area (4~5) in high compression members at critical links. Overall new member layout forming multiple triangles to spread load and avoid overstress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Using two upper internal nodes (node_8 and node_9) above node_3 to divide stresses helps reduce compression in long members connected directly from node_1 or node_3, creates shorter compressive members with less buckling length and smaller force magnitude. Selecting area sizes 2 and 3 mostly for light members, but area 4 on critical diagonals to avoid compressive failure. Node_3 load distributed along multiple member paths. Ensure no node movement of loads/supports (node_1,2,3). Expected mass lower than 30 with load paths shorter than previous iterations. Multiple triangles increase redundancy and stress distribution, decreasing max stress. Some area increase accepted to reduce peak stress but balanced to keep mass under limit.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check key members length and area * length for approximate mass.
