Mass is currently well below limit, so stress is primary constraint.",\n  "analysis": "Current max stress 36.98 on member_2 exceeds tensile/compressive limit ±20. Support nodes and load node fixed. Node_4 placed at (2.5, 2.5) causes geometry producing high stresses. Members 2, 3 oval triangle likely concentrates stress. To fix, increase redundancy for force paths or reposition node_4 higher/laterally. Areas on many members are 1 or less, suggest increasing critical members\' cross-sectional area selectively.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Options: add node higher to spread load path, rearrange member connections to reduce stress peaks. Members connected to node_4 carry mixed stresses. Node position placement affects member length and angles, so optimal node_4 placement is key.",\n  "proposal": "Add one node between node_3 and node_4 vertically higher to spread forces. Connect new node with node_4 and node_3 appropriately. Increase cross-sectional area on highly stressed members, especially member_2 and member_3, to area \'3\' or \'4\'. Adjust node_4 placement slightly higher and right to improve load path.",\n  "reasoning": "Raising node_4 and adding new node distributes load more evenly, reducing maximum member force.
