Load of -10 N at 45° down-left on node_3. Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Objective: closed truss (all nodes connected in a loop). Constraints: stress ±30, mass ≤30 with given area choices. No node position change allowed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Given nodes are collinear at y=0, which cannot form a closed truss without introducing at least one new node off the line. But instruction states do not change given node positions and no duplicate nodes, so we must form closed truss only with these 3 nodes. This means forming triangle. Currently nodes are (0,0), (6,0), (2,0) all on x-axis, collinear, so no area - invalid as closed truss. Hence, add auxiliary node(s) off line? Instruction forbids adding nodes. So closed truss with 3 nodes must have non-collinear nodes. Since node positions can\'t be changed, only 3 nodes, and must be closed - no option but to use only these nodes connected as triangle (impossible here). Reconsider: Is node_3 actually at (2,0)? Yes, because given. So closed truss impossible with 3 collinear nodes. Perhaps an edge case: allow members connecting node_3 to node_1 and node_3 to node_2 and node_1 to node_2 as members forming a single line, but the truss is not closed, no area enclosed. So, minimally add diagonal member or introduce eccentricity? Must comply with instructions: no change in nodes, no duplicate nodes. So closed truss here must mean closed polygon formed by members using given nodes only. So \'closed\' means triangle formed by nodes 1,2,3. But impossible since nodes 1,2,3 are collinear on x-axis. We must challenge this. Maybe minimal off-line placement is introduced by node_3 to create a triangle, but given nodes fixed. So truss cannot be truly closed polygon. Could the instruction mean closed truss with all nodes connected such that no disconnected parts? Then \'closed\' meaning connected graph, not necessarily polygon enclosed area. Then connecting members 1-3, 3-2, and 2-1 forms a loop. So three members forming triangle, even if nodes are collinear, is useable. But it is structurally singular and unable to support load in-plane moments. So assumptions: treat node_3 at slightly off-line position with small y ≈ 0.01 to create area? Instruction forbids changing node position. So let\'s assess simplest approach: connect nodes 1-3, 3-2, 2-1, areas chosen to remain within stress/mass constraints. Calculate stress assuming load and static equilibrium. Approximate member length straightforward. Mass = sum(length*area) capped at 30.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Closed truss interpreted as closed loop connecting the given nodes. Node positions fixed.

Compute member forces by equilibrium. Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_2 = 6.0, node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_2-node_3 = 4.0. Use method of joints at node_3 with applied load. Forces in members must balance load. Since all three nodes collinear, members are collinear; assuming truss designed as a triangle for loading, but here effectively a 1D truss. Large stresses expected in members along x-axis due to load and geometry. To keep stress under ±30, increase member areas accordingly. Mass is sum(length*area). Areas chosen from provided lookup. Iteratively select smallest areas that keep stress under limits and total mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: L12=6.0, L13=2.0, L23=4.0. Assume line forces only. Load at node_3 = Fx=-7.07N, Fy=-7.07N but in x-axis truss only, vertical member not present. So inclined load creates bending, but truss resists axial forces. We\'ll approximate force path along horizontal members. Assuming reactive vertical and horizontal forces at supports. Axial force in members: analyzing node_3, the axial member forces must balance load vector. Since axial members collinear, truss may be insufficient for vertical loads. However, follow instructions. Stress = Force / Area. Force calculated from static equilibrium. Area selected from given discrete values.",\n  \n  "calculation": "At node_3: sum forces horizontally Fx = -7.07 N, activity involves members 1-3 and 2-3. Let forces in members be F13 and F23 (tensile positive). At node_3: F13 + F23 + Fx = 0 -> F13 + F23 = 7.07 N. Vertically, no members vertical, so support reactions must carry Fy = -7.07 N. At supports: node_1 pinned (Rx1,Ry1), node_2 roller (Ry2). Sum vertical forces: Ry1 + Ry2 = 7.07 N (upwards). Sum moments about node_1 horizontal: Ry2 × 6.0 - Fy × 2.0 = 0 => Ry2 = (7.07 × 2.0) / 6.0 = 2.36 N. Ry1 = 7.07 - 2.36 = 4.71 N. Horizontal equilibrium at node_1: Rx1 = - (force in member 1-2) - (force in member 1-3). Member 1-2 is along x-axis from 0 to 6, member 1-3 along x-axis length 2. We did not connect 1-2 and 1-3 only; members are 1-2, 1-3, 2-3. So force in 1-2 labeled F12, unknown. At node_1: F12 + F13 + Rx1 = 0. Assuming members only axial forces. To simplify, assume symmetrical load distribution: F13 = F23 = 3.535 N (half load). Then F12 balances horizontal reaction: F12 + F13 + Rx1=0. Rx1 unknown, solve equilibrium of whole truss horizontally: sum horizontal load is -7.07 N, so Rx1 must be +7.07 to balance (roller at node_2 allows vertical only), so Rx1 = 7.07 N. Then F12 + F13 = -7.07. Substitute F13=3.535, F12 = -10.605 N (compressive). Check stresses: Stress = Force/Area. Choose areas to keep stress <30. For member 1-2: length=6, force=10.605 N (compressive), area A12≥ Force/Stress_limit = 10.605/30=0.3535, select area 0.782 (id 2). For member 1-3: length=2, force=3.535 N, area≥3.535/30=0.118, select 0.195 (id 1). For member 2-3: length=4, force=3.535 N, area≥0.118, select 0.195 (id 1).
