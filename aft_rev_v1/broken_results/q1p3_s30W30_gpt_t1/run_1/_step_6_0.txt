Current design fails mass slightly, stress okay.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current max stress is 8.53 < 30 (good), but total mass = 31.59 > 30 (fails). Areas mostly 2 or 3 (0.782 or 1.759) for members, some mid-sized cross members high mass. Nodes fixed at supports and load, some interior nodes (node_4, node_6) movable. Existing topology complex, dense member usage causes high mass. History shows attempts with larger members and additions didn\'t reduce mass sufficiently.", \n    "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce mass, lower cross-sectional areas where stress allows, possibly remove redundant members or shorten members by repositioning interior nodes closer to load/support lines; keep stable triangulated structure to maintain stress limits.",\n\n    "proposal": "Modify topology slightly: remove member_7 (node_2-node_4) to reduce mass, move node_6 closer to node_2 and node_4 (adjust y down from 1.8 to 1.5), reduce some areas from \'3\' (1.759) to \'2\' (0.782) for less stressed members, and keep main load paths intact. Reduce member_5 area from \'2\' to \'1\' (0.195) to save mass where stress is low.

Lower cross-sectional areas for members with stresses well below limit, especially member_5 from 2 to 1 area, member_3 and member_4 reduced to \'2\' area from \'3\'.
