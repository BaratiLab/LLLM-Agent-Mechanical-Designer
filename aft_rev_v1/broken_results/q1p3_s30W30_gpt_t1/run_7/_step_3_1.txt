Stress is safe, so can reduce member areas and optimize geometry for efficiency. Nodes fixed at supports and load (node_1, node_2, node_3) and load node_3 on bottom. Key is to reduce heavy long members (member_4, member_5 connecting node_1 and node_2 to node_5) which are large area (4). Also current node_5 is at y=3.8; lowering it or adjusting position may reduce lengths and mass. Consider adding an intermediate node to redistribute forces more efficiently.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce areas on heavy members; relocate or add node near load to reduce forces in large members; possible triangle geometries with less area on long members; keep supports fixed.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep nodes 1,2,3 fixed. Add node_4 near node_3 but above, at (2.5,2.0). Connect node_4 to nodes 1,2,3,5 to form stable triangle with better load transfer. Move node_5 lower to (2.0,3.0) to shorten members. Reduce areas on longer members. Proposed members: node_1-node_3 (2), node_2-node_3 (2), node_3-node_4 (1), node_4-node_5 (1), node_1-node_4 (2), node_2-node_4 (2), node_5-node_4 (1). This geometry reduces long member lengths, uses smaller areas, and redistributes load paths.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_4 closer to load splits load-carrying members, reducing length and required area. Lowering node_5 reduces member length and thus mass. Using smaller areas on shorter members saves mass while meeting stress limits. Connections form efficient triangulated frame minimizing bending, optimizing axial force paths. Area selections consider mass and strength balance.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_3=2.0m, node_2-node_3=4.0m, node_3-node_4=2.0616m, node_4-node_5=1.4142m, node_1-node_4=2.6926m, node_2-node_4=3.9051m. Estimated mass sum with area factors and lengths yields < 30 kg with areas selected. Stress expected to remain < 30 given reduced lengths and redistributed loads.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Mass = Σ length * area factor; approximate sum: (2*0.782)+(4*0.782)+(2.0616*0.195)+(1.4142*0.195)+(2.6926*0.782)+(3.9051*0.782) ≈ 1.564 +3.128 +0.402 +0.276 +2.107 +3.055 ≈ 10.53 total, well below 30.
