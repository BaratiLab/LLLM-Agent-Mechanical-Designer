Mass 23.4755 <30. Problem: high compressive stress on member_1. Node_3 between supports causes stress concentration. Load at node_3 down-left. Supports pinned at node_1, roller node_2 fixed. Need stiffer load path, reduce member_1 stress.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_1 (node_1-node_3) highly stressed due to load at node_3 close to support. Current layout shortens load path but increases stress on member_1. Members_4 and 5 in tension/compression low stress and have large area profiles. Mass is acceptable but stress violation critical. Reposition node_4 to better distribute stresses and add additional member(s) to reduce member_1 load.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Move node_4 slightly closer to node_3 but higher, create members from node_4 to node_2 and node_1 for triangular stability. Add member from node_2 to node_3 to reduce stress in original member_1. Choose smaller areas for low stress members, larger areas for compression/tension high stress members. Aim for 3 triangular panels for load distribution.",\n\n  "proposal": "Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Move node_4 to (3.2, 4.5). Add member_6 from node_2 to node_3 to share load previously in member_1 and 2.
