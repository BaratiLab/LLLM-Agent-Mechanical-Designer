Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Current mass 40.3 > 30 allowed. Max stress 9.04 < 30, so stress acceptable. Need mass reduction primarily.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has 5 members connecting 4 nodes (one internal node at 2.0,3.8). Members 4 and 5 are heavy (areas 4), contributing large mass. Stress is low but mass overshoot is significant. Current node placement allows load transfer but mass is high due to large cross-sectional areas. Load is on node_3 (2,0). Supports fixed at ends 0,0 and 6,0. Strategy: reposition internal node slightly lower to reduce member lengths, decrease member areas while maintaining stress limit, and possibly add one more diagonal member for better load distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing member areas on longest members (members 4 and 5) and adding one more diagonal member from node_2 to node_5 to triangulate. Relocate node_5 closer to line between node_3 and supports to reduce lengths and mass.",\n\n  "proposal": "Keep existing nodes node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), relocate node_5 to (3.0, 2.5).

Area ids chosen to reduce mass but keep structural integrity. Total 6 members with smaller areas.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Shorter lengths and smaller cross-sectional areas reduce mass. Adding a diagonal from node_2 to node_5 aids load path. Areas chosen to keep member stresses under 30. Node_5 lowered to reduce vertical span thus member lengths.
