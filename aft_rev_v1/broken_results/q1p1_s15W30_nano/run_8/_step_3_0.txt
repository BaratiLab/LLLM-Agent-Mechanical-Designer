Load is -10 at node_3 at -45°. Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current max stress ~50, mass ~27.5 close to limit but stress too high.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current structure has high compressive stress (-50) on member_1 (\'node_1\' to \'node_3\'). Members_6 and 7 have large areas (4) and large mass contributing to total mass. The node at (2,3.5) with diagonal members to node_3 and node_4 cause uneven force distribution. The truss is top-heavy and not efficiently channeling forces to supports.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Need to reduce the length and stress on member_1 by revising layout. Member_1 carries too much load, so reduce force or increase alternative load paths. Possibly add an intermediate node between node_1 and node_2 to create stronger triangulation. Use smaller areas to reduce mass where stresses are low. Remove redundant members or very large area members causing heavy mass and increase stress.",\n\n  "proposal": "Modify node_5 position lower and closer to span centerline for better force distribution at about (3.0, 2.0). Add one intermediate node between node_1 and node_2 offset vertically (node_6) at (4.0, 1.0) to create better triangulation. Adjust member areas to keep within stress and mass limits, use areas mostly ≤3.128 except for critical members which need up to area 4. Remove member_7 (diagonal from \'node_4\' to \'node_3\') to reduce redundancy and mass.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Triangulated layout with intermediate vertical node splits load paths and reduces stress on \'node_1\'-\'node_3\'. Reduced member lengths and lower area assignments optimize mass. Removing redundant members reduces stiffness excess and mass. The position adjustments maintain support constraints and load point fixed. This layout should reduce the peak compressive stress < 15MPa and keep mass ≤30.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: member_1 (node_1-node_3, 2m), member_3 (node_1-node_5, ~3.605m), member_4 (node_5-node_4, ~1.414m), member_5 (node_4-node_2, ~1.414m), new member_6 (node_5-node_6), new member_7 (node_6-node_2), member_8 (node_6-node_4). Internal diagonals facilitate force distribution. Choose areas for compression members larger than tension for optimal mass. Avoid excessive large areas.",\n\n  "calculation": "Total mass weighted sum of (length × area) with area in {0..10}. Member lengths ~2-3.6m; assign area values mostly between 1 and 3 to fix stress <15MPa and keep mass <30. Member_1 area=3 (0.782), member_3=2 (0.782), member_4=1 (0.195), member_5=1 (0.195), new members 6 and 7 area=3 (0.782), member_8 area=1 (0.195). Sum mass estimated <30. Max stress estimated below limit by distributing load and shortening critical members.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicated nodes or members. Node positions fixed for supports and loads. Added node_6 only. Removed member_7 from iteration 2. Areas consistent with stress limits. Mass under 30.
