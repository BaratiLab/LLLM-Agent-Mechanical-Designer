Need to relieve high stress member (member_5 at 24.17) and balance load paths.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High stress in member_5 between node_10 and node_11 (area 1, small area but high stress). Current design lacks sufficient triangulation to distribute load from node_3 downward. Members 1 and 2 use large area 3 to reduce stress but mass penalty is acceptable. Nodes 10 and 11 placed close and low. Triangulation through these nodes causes stress in member_5. Load is diagonal downward left on node_3, mainly tensile/compressive. To reduce stress, increase support to load node_3 by adding node higher than node_10 and node_11 to form stiffer triangular elements. Also, distribute forces more directly from load node_3 to supports via longer members with medium cross-section areas. Avoid too many small members with high stress."\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add new node at (2.5,3.0) above node_10 and node_11. Connect node_1, node_2, node_3, node_10, node_11, and new node_12. Use areas 2 or 3 in diagonal and vertical members to reduce stress. Check mass impact and avoid over-large areas. Remove member_5 and replace with two members connecting new node_12 to node_10 and node_11 to share load."\n\n  "proposal": {\n    "node_dict": {\n      "node_1": (0.0, 0.0),\n      "node_2": (6.0, 0.0),\n      "node_3": (2.0, 0.0),\n      "node_10": (1.5, 2.0),\n      "node_11": (3.5, 2.0),\n      "node_12": (2.5, 3.0)\n    },\n    "member_dict": {\n      "member_1": ("node_1", "node_3", "3"),       # length ~2.0, area 3 (1.759)\n      "member_2": ("node_3", "node_2", "3"),       # length ~4.0, area 3\n      "member_3": ("node_1", "node_10", "2"),      # length ~2.5, area 2 (0.782)\n      "member_4": ("node_10", "node_3", "2"),      # length ~2.23, area 2\n      "member_5": ("node_10", "node_12", "2"),     # replaces original member_5, area 2\n      "member_6": ("node_11", "node_3", "2"),      # length ~2.69, area 2\n      "member_7": ("node_11", "node_2", "2"),      # length ~2.69, area 2\n      "member_8": ("node_11", "node_12", "2"),     # new diagonal from node_11 to node_12, area 2\n      "member_9": ("node_12", "node_3", "2")       # new diagonal from node_12 to node_3, area 2\n    }\n  },\n\n  "reasoning": "By adding node_12 higher than nodes 10 and 11, and connecting it with diagonals to both node_10 and node_11, we introduce additional load paths that reduce stress concentration on any single member. The new member from node_12 to node_3 further diverts the load upward and spreads forces more evenly. Areas 2 (0.782) are sufficient to reduce stress below 15 based on member lengths and load distribution, and total mass remains below 30 due to moderate areas mostly. No member uses max large area 3 unnecessarily to save mass while satisfying strength. The design triangulates loads efficiently between supports and applied load. No node moves or removal of support/load nodes."\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths roughly - m_1: 2.0, m_2: 4.0, m_3: 2.5, m_4: 2.23, m_5: 1.12, m_6: 2.70, m_7: 2.69, m_8: 1.80, m_9: 1.80.

Stress reduction expected by extra load path through node_12."\n\n  "calculation": "Total mass estimated as: member_1: 2*1.759=3.518, member_2:4*1.759=7.036, members_3,4,5,6,7,8,9 length*0.782 (area 2). Sum = 3.518+7.036 + (2.5+2.23+1.12+2.7+2.69+1.8+1.8)*0.782 = 3.518+7.036 + 14.85*0.782 = 10.55 + 11.6 = ~22.1 < 30. Maximum stress expected <15 due to improved triangulation and spread load paths.
