Load at node_3 is -10 N at -45°. Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Current max stress 65.27 exceeds limit. Total mass 22.36 < 30, so room to increase mass by changing member areas and topology.",\n  "analysis": "High compressive stress (-65.27) in member_3 (node_1 to node_3) is critical. Stress distribution is uneven, indicating need to redistribute load paths. Current nodes: Load and supports fixed at nodes 1,2,3. Node_4 added above with connected members not effective enough. Member areas mix small and large, but large stress in small area member_3. Propose to add a new node above node_3 to create a triangular truss to reduce member_3 stress and create alternate load path.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Avoid very high stress on member_3 by adding a new node (node_5) at about (2.8, 2.5). Connect node_5 to nodes 1,3,4(3,2.5) and 2 to form multiple triangles. Use larger cross-sectional area for members under highest axial force. Optimize member areas focusing on reducing lengthened members to manage mass. Calculate approximate member lengths and assign areas from given set.",\n  "proposal": "New nodes: node_5 at (2.8, 2.5). Members: member_1: node_1-node_5, member_2: node_5-node_2, member_3: node_5-node_4, member_4: node_4-node_3, member_5: node_3-node_1, member_6: node_3-node_2. Use cross-sectional areas: 4 (3.128) for crucial longer members, 2 (0.782) for shorter/high-stress members, 1 (0.195) for low-load members to balance mass and stress.",\n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 creates better load distribution through multiple triangular substructures. New topology reduces load on member_3 in current design. Selected cross-sectional areas are moderate to keep mass under 30 while reducing stress below ±15. Structure geometry prioritizes shorter members where possible. The rearrangement avoids direct long compression members under large stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Approximate lengths (m): node_1-node_5 ~ 3, node_5-node_2 ~ 3.5, node_5-node_4 ~ 0.8, node_4-node_3 ~ 2.5, node_3-node_1 ~ 2, node_3-node_2 ~ 4.
