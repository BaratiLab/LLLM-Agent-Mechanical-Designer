Current max stress too high (55.6 > 15), mass 26.2 close to limit 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has high compressive stress in member_1. Large cross-section (area_id 1=0.195) on member_1 but still overstressed. Members connecting node_4 have large areas contributing to mass. Member lengths with heavy cross-section cause mass surge. Load direction induces bending in current 3-node high design.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce stress by enlarging truss height or changing member topology. Possibly add node to create better load paths and reduce length of highly stressed members. Use more slender members where stress is low to reduce mass.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add one intermediate node higher above node_3 along vertical line to increase truss height and distribute forces better. Connect this new node (node_5) to node_1, node_2, and node_3, forming a Warren style truss with triangular topology. Select areas to keep stresses within ±15 and mass <30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Raising node_5 increases inclined member lengths reducing axial force magnitude. Triangular topologies provide good force distribution - compression and tension alternate reducing peak stress. Using lower area members on less stressed chords saves mass. Members carrying load from node_3 moved up to node_5 for better leverage. Selecting areas from catalog to approximate needed stiffness.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_5 at (2.0, 4.0) approx double previous height. Members: node_1-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_3-node_5 added. Remove direct heavy member_1 (node_1-node_3) to reduce large compressive stress path and mass. Areas chosen as follows: heavy compressive members area 3(1.759), lighter tension members area 1(0.195).",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths: n1-n5 ~4.472, n5-n2 ~4.472, n3-n5 ~1.5. Mass approx sum(length * area) should remain <30. Max stress estimated reduced by balanced triangular load path. Compression and tension alternation reduces peak. Mass calcs: (4.472*1.759)*3 + (1.5*0.195)*1 + (6*0.782)*1 ~ 29.5 < 30.
