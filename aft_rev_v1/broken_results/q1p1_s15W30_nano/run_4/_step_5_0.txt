Constraints: max stress ±15, max mass ≤30. Current structure exceeds max stress (44.4) on member_7 and total mass close to limit (28.8).",\n\n    "analysis": "Current design has high stress on member_7 (-44.4), possibly due to insufficient bracing or member selection. Members directly connected to supports carry excessive loads. The existing node_5 location and member configuration lead to stress concentration. Some members use large area sizes, increasing mass but not effectively reducing stress.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Rearranging members for better force distribution and better triangulation is critical. Adding a strategically placed intermediate node can help to share load more evenly and reduce individual member stress. Areas should be chosen judiciously from given discrete set, preferring smaller areas where stress is lower to minimize mass. Avoid very large area on single member that causes stress concentration.",\n\n    "proposal": "Add a new intermediate node (node_6) elevated, between node_3 and node_2 to create additional triangular bracing. Reconfigure members to form triangulated truss paths from load to supports. Assign areas to keep max stress within limit ±15 while keeping total mass < 30. Use smaller area indices (1 to 4) for lighter members with smaller stresses.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Improved triangulation distributes stresses evenly preventing overstressed members. Intermediate node placement splits long members into shorter ones, reducing bending and axial forces. Choosing areas closely matching required capacity avoids material waste. Keeping existing support and load nodes fixed ensures boundary conditions respected. Adding one new node balances complexity and structure stability.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Node_6 tentative at (3.5, 2.5).
