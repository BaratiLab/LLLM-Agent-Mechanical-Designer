Objective to generate closed truss with minimal stress within constraints.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Initial structure is a line of 3 nodes on x-axis. To achieve a closed truss (all nodes connected to form at least one closed loop), a new node is needed off the line. The load at node_3 acts downward-left. To optimize, add one node above node_3 to form a triangular closed truss (tetrahedral would be 3D, not allowed). Triangular truss optimally shares loads and reduces max stress. Calculate member lengths with proper node placement. Assign member areas from given set to minimize mass while keeping stress ≤±15.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 vertically above node_3 for triangular shape. Connect members: (node_1-node_4), (node_4-node_2), (node_3-node_4), and base members (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), completing triangle(s). Calculate approximate stress and member areas iteratively.

Assume axial force and use F = σ × A to size members (σ ≤ 15). Compute length using Euclidean distance. Approximate member forces using method of joints. Use low area values for longer members bearing low stress and increase area where stress is higher. Keep total mass ≤ 30. Balance load transfer from node_3 to supports via the new node_4. Pick node_4 y-coordinate to roughly balance vertical forces, say 3 units above node_3 (from 2,0 to 2,3).",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Static equilibrium at nodes, linear elastic behavior.
