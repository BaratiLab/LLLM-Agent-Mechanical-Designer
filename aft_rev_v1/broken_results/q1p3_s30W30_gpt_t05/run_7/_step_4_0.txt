Current max stress ~27.35 at member_2 (tension). Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 movable only.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress is high in member_2 with smallest area (area_id=1 = 0.195). Increasing area of member_2 reduces stress but adds mass. Current total mass 18.09 < 30, so some margin for area increase. Node_4 moved down from previous iterations, reducing height reduces member_2 length and stress. Member_1 area is large (3), member_4 and member_5 area 3, member_3 area 2. Member_2 area is very small, causing high stress. Member_2 length is long (from node_4 to node_2).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress in member_2, either increase its area or reduce its length by moving node_4 closer to node_2 horizontally or lower vertically. But node_4 cannot move beyond load/support nodes. Also, member_1 area can be optimized to reduce mass. Member_4 area is large and stress low, can reduce area there. Member_5 area is large with low stress, can reduce. Member_3 area moderate with moderate stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increase member_2 area from 1 (0.195) to 2 (0.782) to reduce stress. Decrease member_4 and member_5 areas from 3 (1.759) to 2 (0.782) to compensate mass increase. Slightly move node_4 closer to node_2 horizontally (from 2.55 to ~2.8) and slightly lower vertically (from 1.7 to ~1.5) to reduce member_2 length and thus stress. This should reduce max stress below 27 and keep total mass under 30. Member_1 area can be kept at 3 for stability. Member_3 area kept at 2 as stress is moderate.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member areas: member_1=3 (1.759), member_2=2 (0.782), member_3=2 (0.782), member_4=2 (0.782), member_5=2 (0.782). Node_4 position approx (2.8, 1.5). Lengths approx: member_2 ~ sqrt((6-2.8)^2 + (0-1.5)^2)=~3.9, member_4 ~ sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-0)^2)=4, member_5 ~ sqrt((2-0)^2 + (0-0)^2)=2. Calculated mass sum ~ sum(length * area): member_1 length ~ sqrt((2.8-0)^2 + (1.5-0)^2)=~3.2 *1.759=5.63, member_2=3.9*0.782=3.05, member_3= sqrt((2-2.8)^2 + (0-1.5)^2)=~1.6*0.782=1.25, member_4=4*0.782=3.13, member_5=2*0.782=1.56 total ~14.6 < 18.09 current mass, so mass reduced and stress likely reduced by area increase and length decrease.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "New design reduces max stress by increasing critical member area and slightly repositioning node_4 to shorten critical member length.
