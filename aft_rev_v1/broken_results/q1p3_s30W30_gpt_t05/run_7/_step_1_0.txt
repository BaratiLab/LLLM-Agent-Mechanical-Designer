Load at node_3, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Node_3 and node_4 can be moved; node_1 and node_2 fixed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_3 (node_1-node_4) at 29.05, tensile. Member_4 also high stress 20.15. Member_2 stress very low (-1.78). Mass is under limit, so can consider increasing area in critical members or reposition nodes to reduce stress. Current topology is a closed quadrilateral with diagonal (node_3-node_4). Stress concentration likely due to node_4 position. Moving node_4 slightly upward or horizontally can redistribute forces and reduce peak stress. Also consider reducing area in low-stress members to save mass or reallocating areas to critical members. All members have areas from set {1:0.195,2:0.782,3:1.759}. Member_3 area is 0.195, member_4 area 0.195, member_5 area 1.759. Increasing area of member_3 and member_4 to 0.782 or 1.759 may reduce stress. Node_3 is on x=2, y=0, can be moved vertically to reduce bending. Node_4 currently at (2,3). Moving node_4 slightly to (2.0,3.5) or (2.5,3.0) may help. Member lengths and geometry must remain stable and closed. No duplicate nodes or members allowed. Load and support nodes fixed.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on moving node_4 upward to reduce tensile stress on member_3 and compressive on member_5. Increase area of member_3 and member_4 from 1 to 2 or 3 to reduce stress. Possibly reduce area of member_5 from 3 to 2 to save mass. Move node_3 slightly upward to reduce bending moment. Check mass after area adjustments. Keep node_1 and node_2 fixed. Stress max must not exceed 30, mass under 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing cross-sectional area reduces stress by increasing load capacity. Moving node_4 upward increases member_3 length, reducing stress concentration. Moving node_3 upward reduces bending. Reducing area of low-stress members saves mass to allow increasing critical members\' area. Current max stress is near limit, so improvements must be subtle. Geometry must remain closed and stable. Areas must be from discrete set. Node_4 movement limited to keep structure stable.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member_3 (node_1-node_4) stress 29.05 at area 0.195. Increasing area to 0.782 or 1.759 reduces stress roughly by ratio of areas. Member_4 (node_4-node_2) stress 20.15 at area 0.195, same applies. Member_5 (node_3-node_4) stress -4.02 at area 1.759, can reduce area to 0.782 to save mass. Member_2 low stress (-1.78) at area 1.759, can reduce area to 0.782 or 0.195. Member_1 moderate stress (-13.06) at 0.782, keep or slightly increase area if needed. Node_4 move from (2,3) to (2,3.5). Node_3 move from (2,0) to (2,0.5). Recalculate lengths for mass estimation. Total mass must remain < 30.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths recalculated: member_3 length from (0,0)-(2,3.5): sqrt(4+12.25)=3.905, mass=3.905*0.782=3.055. Member_4 length (2,3.5)-(6,0): sqrt(16+12.25)=5.315, mass=5.315*0.782=4.157. Member_5 length (2,0.5)-(2,3.5): 3.0, mass=3*0.782=2.346. Member_2 length (2,0.5)-(6,0): sqrt(16+0.25)=4.031, area 0.195, mass=4.031*0.195=0.786. Member_1 length (0,0)-(2,0.5): sqrt(4+0.25)=2.06, area 0.782, mass=2.06*0.782=1.611. Total mass approx 3.055+4.157+2.346+0.786+1.611=11.955 well below 30. Stress reduced by area increase and node movement. Expect max stress < 29. Previous max stress 29.05 at member_3, with area increase from 0.195 to 0.782, stress reduced by factor 0.195/0.782=0.249, so new max stress ~29.05*0.249=7.23, well below limit. Member_4 stress reduced similarly. Member_5 area reduced from 1.759 to 0.782, stress magnitude may increase but initial stress low (-4.02), so safe. Member_2 area reduced from 1.759 to 0.195, stress low (-1.78) so safe.
