Aim to reduce max stress by adjusting topology and member areas.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current max stress is 30.46 at member_3, slightly over limit. Mass is 13.6, well under max 30. Member_3 area is 1 (smallest). Increasing area there would increase mass. Members 1 and 5 have large areas (3) but low stresses, indicating potential to reduce their areas. Node_4 position affects stress distribution; current position (2.3,3.0) is close to previous (2.0,3.5). Member_3 connects node_1 to node_4 and is highly stressed in tension. Member_4 has moderate stress and small area. Member_5 has low stress but large area. Node_3 is load node and fixed in place. Supports fixed. Member arrangement is triangular with node_4 as apex.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress, consider moving node_4 slightly to better distribute forces, reduce area of low stress members to reduce mass, increase area of highly stressed member_3 only if needed. Possibly add a new node to reduce long member stresses or change member connections. Avoid increasing mass above 30. Use areas from given set. Avoid changing load/support nodes.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Move node_4 slightly higher and more right to reduce tension on member_3. Reduce area of member_1 and member_5 from 3 to 2 or 1 to reduce mass. Keep member_3 area at 1 to avoid mass increase. Member_4 area can be increased from 1 to 2 to reduce its stress. Add a new node_5 at (4.0, 2.5) to introduce a diagonal member between node_2 and node_5 and node_5 to node_4 to redistribute forces. Connect member_6: node_2-node_5 area 2, member_7: node_5-node_4 area 2. Remove member_5 to avoid redundancy and reduce mass. This creates a more stable truss with better force distribution.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_3 is highly stressed in tension. Moving node_4 up/right reduces tension length and load effect. Adding node_5 allows load path from node_2 to node_4 via node_5, reducing stress on member_4 and member_3. Reducing areas of low stress members reduces mass without compromising strength. Removing member_5 (node_3-node_4) which has low stress but high area reduces mass and simplifies force paths. Areas chosen to keep max stress within limits and total mass below 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check lengths: node_1-node_4 ~ sqrt((2.5)^2 + (3.2)^2) ~ 4.08, node_2-node_5 ~ sqrt((6-4)^2 + (0-2.5)^2) ~ 3.2, node_5-node_4 ~ sqrt((4-2.5)^2 + (2.5-3.2)^2) ~ 1.8. Areas chosen 1 or 2 correspond to moderate mass. Expect reduced stress on member_3 due to node_4 shift and new load path via node_5.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Mass approx = sum(length * area_factor). Lengths * areas: member_1 (node_1-node_3) length ~2, area 2 → 4; member_2 (node_3-node_2) length 4, area 2 → 8; member_3 (node_1-node_4) length 4.08, area 1 → 4.08; member_4 (node_2-node_4) length ~3.7, area 2 → 7.4; member_6 (node_2-node_5) length 3.2, area 2 → 6.4; member_7 (node_5-node_4) length 1.8, area 2 → 3.6.
