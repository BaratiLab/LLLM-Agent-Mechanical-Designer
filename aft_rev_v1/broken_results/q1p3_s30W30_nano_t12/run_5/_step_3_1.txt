Current at iteration 2 has max stress 8.82 (good), but mass 33.02 (too high). Loads and supports are fixed. Need to reduce mass by optimizing member areas and node layout.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has acceptable stresses but exceeds mass limit by ~10%. Maximum member area used is 4 (3.128), contributing to heavy mass. Some members show zero or very low stress suggesting area downsizing is possible. Two additional nodes beyond support/load fixed nodes add complexity but do not reduce mass effectively.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce members with low stresses to smaller areas. Slightly adjust node_5 position to shorten long members to node_2. Possibly remove redundant or under-utilized member_7 to save mass without compromising stability. Keep nodes fixed for loads and supports; subtle node moves for intermediate nodes can improve efficiency reducing member lengths. Use areas of 1.759 (3), 0.782 (2), and 0.195 (1) strategically.",\n\n  "proposal": "Keep nodes node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed for load/load support. Adjust node_4 to (2.2, 1.4) and node_5 to (3.0, 1.1).

Node revisions shorten some members, lowering required areas. Area selections reflect stress pattern from previous analysis: largest areas on highest load bearing members and downsizing negligible stress members. The force from node_3 (-10, -45°) transferred via members through node_4 and node_5 to supports at node_1, node_2 stably with reduced mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Recalculate mass = ∑ length × area.
