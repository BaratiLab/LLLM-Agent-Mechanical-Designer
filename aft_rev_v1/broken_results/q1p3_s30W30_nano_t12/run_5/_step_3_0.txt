Members and nodes redistribute load but mass excess mainly from member_3, member_6, member_7 with larger area IDs (4 and 3). Node layout includes 5 nodes with load at node_3 and fixed supports at node_1, node_2.",\n  \n  "analysis": "To reduce mass while maintaining or lowering stress, member lengths and required cross-section areas must be reduced. Current max stress ~9 high margin below limit, so we can downsize members in lower-stress zones. Node_5 relatively close to node_2 adds complexity with member_6 and member_7 both significant mass contributors. Removing node_5 and directly connecting node_4 to node_2 can simplify and reduce member lengths. Also, lowering area ids on members carrying less stress will save mass. Reworking vertical height of node_4 to moderate height can reduce long tensile and compressive members, and placing node_3 slightly higher than baseline line of nodes 1 and 2 helps force distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Eliminate node_5 to remove members_6,7 use polygonal triangulation with node_4 at approx (2.0,1.2). Keep node_3 at (2.0, 0.5) above base line to reduce compression areas. Specify cross-sections from available area_id table ensuring all stresses < ±30 and mass < 30.",\n\n  "proposal": "Remove node_5. Set nodes: node_1(0.0, 0.0), node_2(6.0, 0.0), node_3(2.0, 0.5), node_4(2.0, 1.2). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_3-node_2. Assign areas on members to optimize mass; generally smaller areas on less loaded members, bigger on load paths. Expect total mass <30 and max stress <30.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Node_5 and associated members cause high mass. Removing it reduces mass and complexity. Raising node_3 reduces compression in node_1-node_3 and tension along base, lowering area needed. Using triangular configuration distributes forces efficiently. Assign smallest possible areas while keeping max stress limitation satisfied, considering member lengths. This is a standard stable triangulated truss scheme for four nodes, simple and efficient.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: node_1-node_3 = 0.5, node_3-node_4 = 0.7, node_4-node_2 = sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-1.2)^2) ≈4.18, node_1-node_4= sqrt(2^2+1.2^2)=2.33, node_3-node_2= sqrt(4^2 + 0.5^2) ≈4.03. Assign areas with priority: higher stress members a medium area 2 or 3, low stress members area 1 (0.195). An iterative final FEM run will verify max stress <30 and mass <30.",\n\n  "calculation": "Estimation: member lengths (L): m1-1-3=0.5, m2-3-4=0.7, m3-4-2=4.18, m4-1-4=2.33, m5-3-2=4.03.
