Current max stress 38.22 > 30 and mass 21.16 < 30. Stress reduction needed, maintain supports and loads.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current max stress exceed limits due to members 5 and 7 (±38.22). Mass is acceptable. The triangular substructure near node_4 and node_5 with small area members causes stress concentration. Area selections: member_5 and member_7 have area \'1\' (0.195) which is small and stress high. Also, node_5 position high (2.83,2.5) lengthens members increasing mass. Current design partially optimized but fails stress.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress: reposition intermediate nodes to improve force paths, increase cross-section area of high-stress members if possible, remove redundant members causing tension/compression conflicts, better triangulation, and shorten long tensile/compressive members. Consider deleting node_5 and creating a simpler triangular web between node_1,3,2 and node_4 as only new node high enough to distribute load.",\n\n    "proposal": "Remove node_5, reposition node_4 slightly for better load path; use four members connecting node_1-3, node_3-2, node_1-4, node_4-2 with node_4 placed near x=2.66666667, y=1.6 to keep lower height to reduce long members stress. Areas chosen: moderate area 3 or 4 for compression members and area 2 for tension members to keep mass under constraint.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Reducing node count reduces complexity to control stresses. Using one intermediate node (node_4) forms stable triangular substructure handling horizontal/directional load efficiently. Slightly lowering node_4 reduces long members length and stresses. Selecting moderate area scales improves stress without large mass increase and keeps total mass under 30.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Estimated stress reduction by decreased member lengths. Area choices correspond linearly with member capacity. Member lengths re-calculated analytically. Mass computed as sum(length * area_density).

Assign member_1 and member_2 area 3 (1.759) for tension, member_3 and member_4 area 4 (3.128) for compression. Total mass approx: 2*1.759 + 3.11*3.128 + 3.69*3.128 = 3.518 + 9.735 + 11.54 = 24.8 <30 constraint.
