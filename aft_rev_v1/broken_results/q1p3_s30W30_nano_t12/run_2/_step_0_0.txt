Supports pinned and roller on the base nodes will balance vertical load. The diagonal members must resist tension/compression caused by 45° load on node_3. Aim for minimum mass means smallest areas possible that maintain stress<30. Member cross-sections selected guided by calculated stress via simple truss method. Node positions fixed for load and supports; node_3 along x-axis makes equilateral triangle unlikely, so geometry affects member force magnitudes.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Total member lengths length_1-3 ~ 2m, 3-2 ~ 4m, 1-2 =6m.
