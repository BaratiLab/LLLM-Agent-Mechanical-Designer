Node_1 pinned, node_2 roller - stable boundary. Areas discrete from given set. First iteration, no prior assumptions.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Initial structure with 3 nodes is colinear along x=0 to x=6, all on y=0. Closed truss requires at least 3 members forming loop. Current nodes alone form line - not closed. Need to add at least one new node with chosen coordinates to form triangle to satisfy the closure and stability, and reduce stress. A triangle is minimal closed truss. Because supports are at ends, optimal is to raise node_3 to a positive y, creating triangular shape - both for closed loop and increased stiffness.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Candidate approach: Modify new node_3 y-coordinate to positive; carefully position it to balance forces. Add members forming triangle (node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_2). Ensure all are connected (closed). Determine areas from the given set by estimating axial forces from static equilibrium, keeping stresses ≤30. Length from given coordinates used for mass calculation.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Using simple truss statics: forces resolved at nodes at equilibrium. Load at node_3 down-left (vector for force: magnitude=10 at -45° means components Fx = -7.07 kN, Fy=-7.07 kN approximately). The 3-member triangular truss formed of members m1: node_1-node_3, m2: node_2-node_3, m3: node_1-node_2 will balance this. Choose areas to keep max stress ≤30 kN/m^2 and minimal total mass (member length × area). Assumptions: axial forces in members derived from equilibrium, members only carry axial loads, linear elastic behavior.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Apply equilibrium at node_3: force sum zero including external load and member forces. Lengths from coordinates. Stress = axial force / area. Select area to ≤ stress limits. Mass = sum(length × area). Use nearest area from given set, either 1 (area_id \'0\') or less to minimize weight.
