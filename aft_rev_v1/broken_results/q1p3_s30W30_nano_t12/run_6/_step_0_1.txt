Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Objective: closed truss means at least a triangle connecting all nodes. Constraints: stress limit ±30 units tensile/compressive; total member mass ≤30 units using node-to-node distances and predefined cross-sectional areas.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The simplest closed truss with three nodes is a triangle connecting node_1, node_2, and node_3. Adding members between these will create a stable structure with internal force distribution. Areas should be assigned to members balancing mass and stress. The load is significant and diagonally downward at node_3, pin and roller supports should resist vertical and horizontal loads. Members carry axial loads; estimating internal member forces using the method of joints and approximate trigonometric relations is prudent.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Use triangular geometry with given nodes to compute member lengths: node_1-node_3 ≈ 2.0 units; node_3-node_2 ≈ 4.472 units; node_1-node_2 = 6.0 units. Select areas so sum(member_length × area) ≤30. Approximate member axial forces analytically with static equilibrium: resolve the 10N load downward-left at 45°, then solve joint equilibrium for forces. Ensure no member stress exceeds ±30, pick area inversely proportional to max member stress.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Closed triangular truss connecting (0,0), (6,0), and (2,0) nodes is minimal and stable. However, node_3 lies on line between node_1 and node_2, so node_3 is on the base line. This suggests adding a vertical node to create a triangular shape is not allowed as node placement can\'t be changed. To maintain closure with only 3 nodes in this line, add internal diagonal members irresponsibly will not close the truss. Check if bars from node_3 to node_1 and node_3 to node_2; since node_3 is in between along x-axis, maybe not a closed triangle. But node_3 = (2,0), node_1 = (0,0), node_2 = (6,0), all on same line. That can\'t define a truss; must add an additional node above (or below). Instruction forbids moving nodes but does not forbid adding nodes. Given objective is closed truss, minimum 3 nodes but not colinear. Adding node_4 placed vertically above node_3 at (2, h) with h>0 sufficient to form a triangle with base nodes. For minimal mass and low stress, place node_4 vertically with modest height so biomechanical equilibrium holds under load. Then connect node_4 with node_1, node_2 and node_3. Assign areas to each member to satisfy constraints and minimize mass. Supports kept at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) as per inputs. Load applies at node_3. Note mass is sum_length * assigned area where areas from set provided.
