To form a statically stable closed shape, at least one node must be placed off the baseline to create triangles. I will add one new node \'node_4\' above baseline, near node_3, to form two triangles for stability. Lacking requirement against new nodes allows improving load transfer and reducing member stress. Added node position chosen for minimal additional length but adequate height for stress reduction. Member connections created for full closed path node_1, node_2, node_4, node_3 with line members ensuring all nodes linked. Areas selected from library prioritizing smallest areas that respect stress constraint.

Compute member lengths of smaller members close to 3.5 units. Calculate forces assuming vertical load of -10 units at node_3 descending at 45˚ = approx -7.07 vertical component, accounting reactions to ensure balanced support reactions and transfer through angle members. Area selections start from 1 (largest) for primary load members, smaller area (0.195 to 0.782) for tension and compression with smaller force expected.

Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) resist vertical and horizontal reactions; horizontal reaction mostly at node_1. To stabilize and avoid high stress in horizontal baseline members (which under bending do not resist well), establish diagonal members to transfer axial force. The elevated node_4 reduces effective member length-spans which reduce axial forces and observes buckling risk. Members chosen to close truss: node_1-node_3 (baseline), node_3-node_4 (inclined), node_4-node_1 (inclined), and node_3-node_2 baseline and node_2-node_4 inclined to complete closed loop.
