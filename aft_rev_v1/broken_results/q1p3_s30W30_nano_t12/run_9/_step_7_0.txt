Load is -10 N at node_3 at -45°. Supports same. Current max stress > 30, total mass 15.65 < 30. Lower max stress by rearranging bars and adjusting areas.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current stresses show member_1 highly compressed (-55.35), exceeding constraints. Member_5 area is large (3), adding mass looking at member masses - large mass due to member_5. The current triangular layout with 4 nodes is simple but member_1 too stressed. Load is at node_3 at ground line between supports, inducing high compressive stress in member_1. Higher nodes help redistribute load. Previous iterations with more nodes and members reduced stress well but increased mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding a new node above node_3 or slightly shifted in Y to better distribute load; add members connecting node_3 to this new node and to supports. Smaller cross-section for highly loaded member_1 possible if length is reduced. Try adding one node above node_3 at ~2.5,3.5 to form a triangular truss with better stress distribution, with members connected to node_1,2,3,new node. Use area ids with small increments for compression.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add one node_5 at (2.5, 3.3). Members: node_1-node_3 area 1, node_2-node_3 area 1, node_1-node_5 area 2, node_2-node_5 area 2, node_3-node_5 area 3. This splits load and reduces compression in member_1. With members acting as truss with compressive and tensile forces balanced, use area assignments to address stresses <30 also combined masses to remain below 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node at 2.5, 3.3 creates a good triangle on top; all close to previous designs but moves connection slightly upward lessening compressive forces. Members from node_5 to supports carry some load, reducing stress on node_1-node_3. Area allocation chosen to keep low mass (area ids 1,2 and max 3). Previous similar structures with more members had stress violations or high mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths approx: node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_2 = 4.0, node_1-node_5 ~3.9, node_2-node_5 ~3.6, node_3-node_5 ~3.3. Calculate individual member masses: mass = length × area factor. Compare sum with mass limit 30. Stress estimate: reduce old -55 to -30 by reducing area and increasing supporting branches.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Mass = (2×0.195) + (4×0.195) + (3.9×0.782) + (3.6×0.782) + (3.3×1.759) = 0.39 + 0.78 + 3.05 + 2.82 + 5.81 = 12.85 < 30 good.
