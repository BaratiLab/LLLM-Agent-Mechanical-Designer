Current max stress 42.31 > 20 and mass 4.15 < 30. Need to reduce stress mainly by adding or repositioning nodes and using appropriate cross-section areas.",\n  "analysis": "Current structure uses 4 nodes and 6 members with uniform small cross-section (area_id \'1\' = 0.195). High stresses occur in members connecting to loaded node_3 and to node_4. Load direction causes tension/compression beyond limits. Structure rigidity and load paths insufficient; member_1 and member_4 highly stressed. Cross-section area too small to reduce stress, mass limit offers room to increase areas or add members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add intermediate nodes to better triangulate and distribute load. Position a new node above node_3, create members forming multiple load paths and reduce stress concentrations. Increase some member areas selectively. Maintain load/support nodes fixed. Remove redundant members extending diagonally from node_1 and node_2 to node_4 as these generate high stress. Optimize areas using areas up to \'4\' (3.128) or less to balance mass and strength.",\n  "proposal": "Add a new node_5 at (2.0, 3.0) above node_4 to form a stiffer upper triangle. Keep nodes 1,2,3,4 fixed. Redefine members as: node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_3-node_5, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4. Assign cross-section areas based on member length and expected stress paths. Utilize areas \'3\' to \'5\' for longer or highly loaded members and smaller areas for less stressed. Remove member_3 (node_1-node_2) to avoid high compression. This should reduce high stresses under load and keep mass under 30.",\n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 increases triangulation with shorter members sharing load, reducing member stresses. Removing the direct base member (node_1-node_2) removes compression member that was under -18 stress, lowering overall mass and forces. Larger cross-sections where high stress expected reduce stress below limit. Using more members improves load path redundancy and stiffness. Mass allowance (up to 30) allows for increasing areas from \'0.195\' to ~\'3.128\' without exceeding mass limit. Keeping load/support nodes fixed follows instructions.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_1-node_3: 2m, node_2-node_3: 4m, node_3-node_4: 2m, node_4-node_5: 1m, node_3-node_5: ~3.162m, node_1-node_4: ~2.828m, node_2-node_4: ~4.472m.
