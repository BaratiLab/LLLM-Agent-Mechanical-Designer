Member_7 is node_3-node_5 with smallest area \'1\' but critical stress. Increasing area on this member risks mass increase. Reducing force in member_7 by changing geometry or adding bracing can help. Current nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_5(2,2.5). Member_7 is vertical member, under large stress. Adding a diagonal bracing from node_5 to node_2 or node_1 might help redistribute forces to reduce member_7 stress. Alternatively, reposition node_5 vertically or horizontally to optimize. Areas can be optimized per member.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increase area in member_7 to at least \'3\' (1.759), add diagonal from node_5 to node_2 to create a truss triangle. Move node_5 slightly toward node_2 to reduce member_7 load. Check if member_7 stress falls below 20. Remove or reduce area in low stress members.

Adjust areas of members to optimize mass and stress: member_1 area \'2\', member_2 area \'2\', member_3 area \'1\', member_7 area \'3\', member_8 area \'2\', member_9 area \'2\', member_10 area \'3\'.",\n  "reasoning": "Moving node_5 closer to node_2 reduces load on member_7 by sharing forces with new member_10.
