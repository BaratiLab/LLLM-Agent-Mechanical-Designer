Loaded node is node_3, supports fixed. Can adjust node_3 and node_4 positions (node_1 and node_2 fixed). Area sizes used currently mostly 2 or 3, some members higher area needed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max compressive stress is high at member_1 (-14.2093), connecting node_1 to node_3, close to the loaded node. Load is downward-left at node_3. Node_3 currently lies at (2.0, 0.0), near base line. Node_4 at (3.0, 3.5) forms the apex. Members connecting through node_4 carry significant load (member_3 and member_5). Stress distribution shows member_1 highly stressed in compression, members 3,4,5 in tension. Proposal: reposition node_3 slightly upward to better distribute load, also adjust node_4 slightly to reduce maximum stress in member_1 and member_5. Consider reducing area of member_3 or member_4 to reduce mass, keeping stress limits. Check if increasing node_3 height reduces compressive stress in member_1. Members are connected correctly; no duplicates or violations. Areas can be adjusted but must stay within available sizes.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing node_3 y-coordinate from 0.0 to ~0.5-1.0 might reduce compressive stress in member_1. Node_4 can be slightly adjusted right/left, or up/down to optimize. Keep node_1 and node_2 fixed as supports. Member areas might be adjusted: reduce areas in low stress members, increase strategically if needed.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Load at node_3 downward-left causes high compressive stress in member_1 (node_1-node_3). Lifting node_3 upwards reduces horizontal compression in member_1. Node_4 height and lateral position tune force flow to members 3,4,5. Using areas 2 or 3 mostly, except for member_3 currently at area=3 (1.759), can try reducing member_3 area to 2 (0.782) if stress allows for mass reduction. Increasing height of node_3 and moderate adjustment of node_4 expected to redistribute stresses, reduce peak compressive stress, especially in member_1 and member_5. Total mass should stay below 30 despite increasing member lengths via node moves because we can reduce some areas. Member lengths need recalculation accordingly.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node positions: node_3 at (2.0,0.0), node_4 at (3.0,3.5). Move node_3 to ~ (2.0,0.8). Move node_4 to (3.2,3.2).
