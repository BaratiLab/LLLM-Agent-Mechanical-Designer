Load of -10 at 45° downward-left applied at node_3. To form a closed structure, a triangle is formed if we add a member between node_1 and node_2 and connect nodes appropriately. Members could be (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), and (node_1-node_2). This creates a triangular closed truss. Node_1 and node_2 supports will balance the load at node_3. Need to check stress in members under load and choose areas minimizing mass yet keeping stresses within limits.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Check truss geometry and member lengths.

Thus, structure must be augmented to provide vertical support.\\n\\nConclusion: Current nodes all on line => vertical component cannot be resisted by these members.\\n\\nTo provide vertical support and closed truss, add a new node above the line at optimal y position (e.g., node_4), connect node_3 to node_4 and node_1 and node_2 to node_4, making a triangular prism shape. But constraint says no new nodes.\\n\\nAlternative: use diagonal members. Since only 3 nodes given, closed truss is only possible by connecting all pairs: 1-2, 1-3, 2-3.\\nMembers: (1-3), (3-2), (1-2). But all on x-axis, no vertical components. Under vertical load, members take axial force only if inclined.\\n\\nHence assumption is incorrect. There\'s 1 more node missing or must revise connections to allow vertical force transfer.\\n\\nInstruction 5 prohibits node position change or new nodes.\\n\\nTherefore, vertical load applied at node_3 is not balanced vertically by horizontal members.\\n\\nHence force at node_3 must be resolved by the supports via reactions only or adding vertical members (not possible), or load direction reinterpretation needed.\\n\\nGiven load direction is -45°, so force vector components at node_3:\\nFx = magnitude*cos(-45) = -10*cos(45) = -7.07 (left)\\nFy = -10*sin(45) = -7.07 (down)\\n\\nSo force vector is (-7.07, -7.07)\\n\\nIf no vertical members exist, members cannot take vertical components; supports must provide reactions.\\n\\nMembers between nodes (1-3), (3-2), (1-2) lie along x-axis only.\\n\\nTo introduce vertical component in members, a diagonal member is needed between node_1 and node_2 (which is horizontal) or adding vertical member\\n\\nBut only the three nodes exist. So place diagonal members between node_1 and node_2 and node_1 and node_3, etc., to make triangle.\\n\\nHence the only closed truss is the triangle formed by nodes 1, 2, 3.\\n\\nReconsider member layout:\\n- (node_1-node_3): length 2\\n- (node_3-node_2): length 4\\n- (node_1-node_2): length 6\\n\\nAnalysis to resolve forces:\\nAt node_3:\\nMembers 1-3 and 3-2 oriented horizontally. No vertical support from members.\\n\\nThus vertical load is Balanced by vertical reactions at supports.\\n\\nCheck stress in members:\\nIf members only carry axial load from horizontal components (-7.07 N leftward), distribute force accordingly.\\n\\nCalculate forces assuming structure as is under given load and supports.\\n\\nSelect areas to keep stresses < 20.\\n\\nMass = sum(member length × area)\\n\\nAssuming cross-sectional areas as:\\n- member 1-2: area 3 (1.759)\\n- member 1-3: area 2 (0.782)\\n- member 3-2: area 2 (0.782)\\nTotal mass = 6*1.759 + 2*0.782 + 4*0.782 = 10.554 + 1.564 + 3.128 = 15.246 < 30 limit\\n\\nCalculate stresses:\\nMax force on member 1-2 assumed approx 10 N (from load projection).
