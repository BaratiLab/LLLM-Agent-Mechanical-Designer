Supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller. Initial design exceeded max stress ±20 (member_2 at -50.36). Mass within limit (23.2 < 30). Need redesign to reduce stress especially on member_2 and improve load path.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current design has a high compressive stress on member_2 (node_1-node_3). Member_2 area is minimal (area_id \'1\' = 0.195). Node_3 placed on baseline, causing large stress. Node_4 used as top node to reduce stress in diagonal members but not enough. Members connecting to node_3 highly stressed due to load and geometry. Strategy: Raise node_3 vertically to reduce bending and stress concentration, add a new node above node_3 for better triangulation and load redistribution. Increase cross-sectional area of highly stressed members. Remove redundant or inefficient members to save mass.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Move node_3 up from baseline; add node_5 at (2.0, 1.5). This creates two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_5) and (node_3, node_2, node_5). This better distributes load from node_3. Use larger areas on members connected to load node_3 and at diagonal braces. Keep node_1 and node_2 positions same due to support conditions. Remove member_1 (node_1-node_2) as it might be inefficient and redundant due to triangulation. Calculate new member lengths and assign appropriate areas based on stress estimation.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Nodes: keep node_1 and node_2 fixed. Raise node_3 to (2.0, 1.0). Add node_5 at (4.0,1.5). Use members: node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_5, node_2-node_5, node_1-node_5, node_5-node_4 (node_4 remains at 3.5, 3.0). Areas adjusted: increase areas for members connected to node_3 and node_5 to reduce stress. Remove member_1 (node_1-node_2) to save mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Raising node_3 reduces compressive stress on members connected to the load. Adding node_5 creates better triangulation, redistributing forces and reducing high stress seen in member_2 previously. Removing member_1 keeps mass in check and avoids redundancy since triangulation will provide stability. Larger cross-section areas on high-load paths keep stress within ±20.
