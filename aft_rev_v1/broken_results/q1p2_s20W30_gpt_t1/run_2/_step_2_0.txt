Current max stress ~53 and mass ~37 exceed limits. Load on node_3 downward-left. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Nodes 1, 2, 3 fixed."\n\n  "analysis": "Current design heavy members (areas 4 and 2 mostly). Member_6 and member_7 exceed stress limits greatly (~-51, -53). Total mass is too high. High stress suggests inefficient load path from node_3 load to supports. Adding node_5 at (3.5,1.5) did not improve due to large area members and insufficient load redistribution. Members connecting node_5 (members 6 and 7) highly stressed. Needs redesign with better load path, more triangulation, and smaller areas where possible.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce mass and stress: reduce large cross-section members; reposition added nodes for better force flow; form smaller triangles; remove or adjust node_5; possibly add new node(s) at strategic height between node_3 and supports for load distribution.",\n\n  "proposal": "Keep support and load nodes fixed. Remove node_5. Add two new nodes: node_5 at (1.5, 1.5) and node_6 at (4.5, 1.5) to improve triangulation. Connect nodes to form multiple triangles: node_1-node_5-node_4-node_6-node_2. Connect node_3 to node_5 and node_6. Use smaller to medium areas on longer members and slightly larger areas on short high-load members to keep stresses within ±20 and mass below 30.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Triangulated truss minimizes bending, distributes load efficiently. Additional nodes midpoint between supports and load node help transfer load through shorter members, reducing high stress in long members. Smaller areas on longer members reduce mass. Medium areas on short tension/compression members ensure strength. Removing node_5 (3.5,1.5) replaced by two symmetric nodes at 1.5 height to balance structure.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Use area ids mostly between 1 (0.195) and 3 (1.759) for members except those immediately loaded which can have up to 4 (3.128).
