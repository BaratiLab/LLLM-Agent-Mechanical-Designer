Current max stress 29.05 > 20 limit. Mass 8.7161 < 30 is acceptable. Need to reduce stress, especially in member_3 (29.05 tensile) and member_4 (20.15 tensile). Areas currently small for these members.",\n\n    "analysis": "High stress in diagonal members suggests load transfer via shorter, stiffer members or additional bracing. Current topology has one interior node only (node_4) at (2,3). Node_3 at (2,0) under load. Members from node_1 and node_2 to node_4 have low area (1) and this leads to high tensile stress in member_3. To reduce stress, increase cross-sectional areas of critical members or optimize geometry. Adding one more node vertically above node_3 will reduce tension in diagonals and redistribute forces. Also, adjusting cross-sections will help constraints.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_5 vertically above node_3 to form two diagonals from node_3 and sharing load. Increase area of diagonal members transmitting tensile forces. Keep bottom chord as is. Possibly keep member_3 and member_4 as diagonals but use larger sections. Reject removing node_4 because it provides key bracing.",\n\n    "proposal": "Keep nodes 1,2,3 fixed. Add node_5 at (2.0, 4.0). Redefine topology: bottom chord (node_1-node_3-node_2), diagonals from node_1 and node_2 to node_5 (instead of node_4), vertical from node_3 to node_5, and cross braces from node_4 to node_5 and node_4 to node_3 for stability. Assign higher areas to tensile diagonals and moderate areas elsewhere.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Adding node_5 higher increases truss height, reducing force in tension diagonals. Triangulated structure with appropriate areas improves load path. Using larger cross-section (area_id 4 or 5) for tensile members reduces stress below limits. Compression members can use smaller areas. Total mass remains below 30 after optimal sizing.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Length calculations and area choice: bottom chords ~2 m length with area \'2\' or \'3\', vertical member length 4m with area ~3, diagonals length ~4.47 m needs area ~5. Check stress as Force/(Area Ã— allowable stress). Use symmetric design for force balance.",\n\n    "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3: 2m, node_3-node_2: 4m, node_3-node_5: 4m, node_1-node_5: sqrt(2^2+4^2)=4.47m, node_2-node_5: 4.47m, node_4-node_5: sqrt((2.0-2.0)^2+(3.0-4.0)^2)=1m vertical, node_4-node_3: 3m vertical. Areas assigned: bottom chords (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2): \'3\' (1.759), diagonals (node_1-node_5, node_2-node_5): \'5\' (4.887), verticals (node_3-node_5): \'4\' (3.128), braces (node_4-node_5, node_4-node_3): \'2\' (0.782).
