Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Prior max stress exceeds ±20 by >10 times; mass well below limit. Need stiffer structure to reduce stress with balanced member sizing.",\n    \n  "analysis": "Current iteration (18/25) stresses exceed limits by a large margin on member_8 (-291.9) compression and member_1 (79.7) tension. Mass is low (14.3), so room for larger areas exists. Members connecting load node_3 to supports are under high stress indicating inefficient load transfer and insufficient triangulation. Current design weak likely due to sparsity and low redundancy in load path. Existing nodes mostly on base and a few on high line; re-arranging intermediate nodes for better triangulation may help. Areas selected so far too small on critical members (areas 1 and 2 mainly). Increasing area on compression member_8 and redistributing load path is required.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Stronger truss topology with more triangles for load distribution. Introduce nodes slightly up and between load-support nodes to reduce member lengths and bending. Use higher area IDs on heavily loaded members near supports and load node. Prioritize members in load path with area 3-5 to reduce stress. Remove ineffective members like member_6 (zero stress).",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep supports and load nodes fixed. Add two new nodes intermediate between node_3 and node_1 (left side) and between node_3 and node_2 (right side) at y=1.8 to improve triangulation. Connect them to neighboring nodes to add redundancy and shorter members. Use areas scaled up to 3 or 4 on compression/tension critical members. Reduce low-stress members\' area to 1 or 0 to save mass. Member layout: connect node_1 to left new node, left new node to node_3; node_3 to right new node, right new node to node_2; also connect new nodes to node_4 above to form stable triangles.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "By adding two precisely placed intermediate nodes at ~1.8 height between load node and supports, we break long members into shorter ones, reducing bending and peak stress. This increases triangulation and stiffness. Larger cross-sectional areas on those load path members ensure stresses remain within ±20 by lowering axial stress. Keeping other members lighter retains overall mass below 30. Selected areas respect the set discrete values. Node positions chosen to maintain structural symmetry and optimal load transfer.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate approximate member lengths and masses using Euclidean distance; estimate stresses inversely proportional to area*length. Ensure no member exceeds ±20 stress. Sum mass = Σ length*area (area scaled by given dict).
