Current max stress is ~249, mass ~26.9. Load at node_3 downward-left. Supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller (x-axis).",\n\n    "analysis": "High stresses at members 5 and 12 with area IDs 2 and 2 causing 241 and 249 stress, exceeding limit. Mass close to limit but stress far above. Structure has multiple intermediate nodes between supports and load node to distribute load. Current design likely oversized members causing stress concentration. Need redistribution and possibly reduce member sizes and revise topology to reduce stress. Also check possible member rearrangement and area reduction.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Existing nodes for load/support fixed by rule; can add/move other nodes. Load at node_3 at (2,0), supports node_1 (0,0) pinned, node_2 (6,0) roller. Strong diagonal triangulation recommended. Stress limits ±20 mean many members need smaller areas or better geometry. Mass limit 30 allows some freedom. Previous iterations show adding nodes near load and adjusting member connections improves stress distribution.",\n\n    "proposal": "Maintain fixed nodes (1,2,3). Add two new nodes: node_12 at (2.5, 1.5) near load to reduce high stress on members near node_3, node_13 at (4.5, 1.5) to strengthen right side. Connect members to form stable triangulated truss with properly sized areas. Areas mostly 1 or 2 with some 3 at force paths. Avoid large areas where not needed to keep mass low. Remove overstressed long members. Connect load node_3 to node_12 and node_7; node_7 at (1,1.2) kept to transfer load to support. Connect node_12 to nodes 4, 10, and node_13; node_13 connects to node_9 and node_2. Triangulate nodes 4,7,8,9,10,11 for load path distribution. Use smaller areas on longer members and larger on shorter critical members.",\n\n    "reasoning": "High stress members near load and right side require better intermediate node support. Adding node_12 near load reduces stress in tension members connected to node_3. Node_13 strengthens right side by connecting to node_9 and node_2 reducing stress seen previously on member_12. Areas selected based on length and estimated force: shorter critical members get larger area. Triangles provide stable load paths. Total added nodes and members balanced to keep total mass under 30. Stress estimations assume good load distribution and moderate areas.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths from coordinates, estimate member forces roughly based on load direction and node connectivity. Check max stress by force / area ensuring |force/area| <= 20. Sum member masses = length * area from given area table. Areas chosen from {\'0\': 1, \'1\': 0.195, \'2\': 0.782,...}. Plan areas mostly 1 or 2, with 3 for short members under high load.",\n\n    "calculation": "Example lengths (approx): node_1(0,0) to node_7(1,1.2) length~1.56; node_7 to node_3(2,0) length~1.55; node_3 to node_12(2.5,1.5) length~1.58; node_12 to node_10(2.8,2.1) length~0.72; node_10 to node_4(3,3.2) length~1.26; node_12 to node_13(4.5,1.5) length~2.0; node_13 to node_9(4.5,2.0) length~0.5; node_9 to node_2(6,0) length~2.06; yields member masses within limits. Areas chosen as 2 (~0.782) mostly, 3 (~1.759) on short, highly stressed members. Estimated total mass under 29 and max stress approx less than 20. FEM refinement would confirm.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes/members, load/support nodes unchanged, within stress and mass limits, connections form stable triangulated structure.
