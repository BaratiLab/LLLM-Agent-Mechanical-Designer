High stress on \'member_1\' and \'member_6\' mostly. Members with largest areas (areas 3 and 4) and node configuration cause high stress concentration; structure is heavy. Need to reduce mass and redistribute stress by reconfiguring members and node placement near load and mid-span.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Nodes for load and support fixed. Introduce a new node between node_3 and node_4 lower than before to reduce member length and force. Limit member areas to max 3 (3.128) to reduce mass, use smaller areas where possible. Re-route members from node_7 and node_9 to relieve stress. Avoid long large-area members that cause mass penalty. Provide a triangulated, planar structure with efficient load paths.",\n  "proposal": "Keep support and load nodes fixed. Keep nodes 1, 2, 3 fixed positions. Move node_4 from (3, 3.2) slightly downward to (3.0, 2.6) for shorter members. Add node_10 at (2.6, 1.5) between node_3 and node_4 to reduce member length. Connect members: 1-7, 7-3, 3-10, 10-4, 4-9, 9-2; add diagonal 7-4, 7-10, 10-9 for triangulation. Assign areas mostly 2 or 3 area_id (0.782 or 1.759) to balance strength and mass. Remove unnecessary members from original design to save mass.",\n  "reasoning": "Reducing node_4 height reduces bending length and stress. Adding intermediate node optimizes member lengths and force distribution, lowering max stress. Triangular connections provide stiffness and reduce load path length. Smaller member areas are chosen due to truss simplicity and mass limit. The structure remains statically determinate with pinned and roller supports at fixed nodes.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check max stress ≤ 20: Use lower or graded areas at high-stress members to keep stress within allowable. Calculate member lengths for mass estimation. Mass = sum(member length × area) ≤ 30. Member areas chosen from {0,1,2,3} for optimization. Estimate stresses by approximating shorter and well-distributed members reduce high tensile/compressive stress. Minimize longer members with large areas.",\n  "calculation": "Node distances (approx): 1-7 ~1.44, 7-3 ~1.2, 3-10 ~1.12, 10-4 ~1.22, 4-9 ~1.12, 9-2 ~1.5. Total length ~7.6. Assign areas: members 1-7 (2), 7-3 (2), 3-10 (3), 10-4 (2), 4-9 (3), 9-2 (3), diagonals (7-4,7-10,10-9) area=2. Mass estimate: sum length*area ≤ ~20 <30 safe margin.
