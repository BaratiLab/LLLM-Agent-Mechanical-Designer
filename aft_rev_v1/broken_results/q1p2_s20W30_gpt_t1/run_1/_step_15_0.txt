Current max stress 38.78 > 20; mass 16.04 < 30. Load: downward-left at node_3. Keep support and load nodes fixed.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Stress exceeds limit in members connected to node_4 and node_10. Member with area 1 causes high stress. Areas 2 and 3 higher mass but lower stress. Geometry could be improved for load path. Add intermediate nodes to reduce spans and redistribute stresses. Members connecting node_4 to others have high stress, consider adding truss nodes near load.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Current design uses triangular substructures but nodes\' vertical distribution is limited. Slightly raising node_4 and adding nodes between node_3 and node_4 can help. Revising member areas: increase areas in high stress tension members, decrease in low stress ones, maintain ≤ 3 to keep mass low.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Maintain pinned node_1 at (0,0), roller node_2 at (6,0), load node_3 at (2,0) fixed. Keep node_4 at (3,3.2) for vertical height. Add node_12 at (2.6,2.4) and node_13 at (3.8,2.0) near node_4 and node_10 to create shorter members, distribute forces.

Adding nodes 12 and 13 gives more load paths, reduces stress. Areas fitted: small areas (1,2) on short members, higher areas (3,4) on heavily loaded longer members. This balances mass vs stress. Avoid very high area to keep total mass under 30. Avoid area 0 (1) on members with notable stress to prevent exceeding stress limits.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and assign areas to ensure max stress ≤ 20.
