Current iteration mass 31.63, max stress 7.94. Load at node_3 downward-left, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Existing design has 6 nodes, multiple members with varying areas.",\n  "analysis": "Current design has acceptable max stress but mass slightly exceeds limit. Members near load and top node seem well sized. Previous iterations show attempts to reduce stress spikes but trade-off in mass. Load at node_3 (-10, -45°) implies tension/compression in lower left and diagonal members. Possible to reduce mass by adjusting areas and slightly repositioning intermediate nodes. Node_6 currently at (2.7,3.0) likely to transfer load upwards, node_5 at (3.0,2.0) to midpoint between load/support nodes. Some members can reduce area to lower mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing member areas of low-stress members, slight node_6 reposition to optimize force flow. Remove member_9 from history, not present now. Avoid adding nodes to keep design minimal and simple. Check if area 1 or 0 can replace 2 for low stress members. Possibly lower member_4 area from 2 to 1. Adjust node_6 y slightly down to 2.8 to improve force transfer and shorten some members.",\n  "proposal": "Use node positions: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (3,3.5), node_5 (3,2), node_6 (2.7,2.8). Members: node_1-node_3 area 2, node_3-node_5 area 2, node_5-node_4 area 1, node_4-node_1 area 1, node_5-node_2 area 2, node_3-node_2 area 1, node_3-node_6 area 2, node_6-node_4 area 2, node_6-node_2 area 1. This reduces mass by lowering higher areas and improves stress distribution with node_6 lower y.",\n  "reasoning": "Reducing member areas where stress is well below limit helps reduce mass. Shortening member lengths also reduce mass. Positioning node_6 slightly lower improves triangular braces and load path, reducing stress in some members allowing area reduction. Areas chosen from available discrete sets to meet stress constraints without excess area. Load transfer routed through node_5 and node_6 to spread forces, reducing peak stresses.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths computed for area mass estimation. Lower areas for member_4 and member_6 (original area 2 to 1) reduce mass significantly. Node_6 drop from 3.0 to 2.8 shortens members 7,8,10 helping mass.
