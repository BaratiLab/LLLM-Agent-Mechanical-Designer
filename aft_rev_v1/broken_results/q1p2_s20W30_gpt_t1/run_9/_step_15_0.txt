Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Nodes fixed at node_1, node_2, and load at node_3. Member areas limited {0..10}. Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass <= 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current iteration 14 total mass 31.63 exceeds mass limit 30. Max stress 7.94 within ±20 limit. Arrangement nodes_1,2,3 fixed; intermediate nodes 4,5,6 varied. Members use area mostly 2-3. Mass borderline high mainly due to longer members and areas chosen. Max stress low, so areas can be reduced to save mass. Some members have smaller length but larger area, causing excess mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing mass by optimizing cross-sectional areas and slightly adjusting free intermediate nodes (4,5,6) to reduce member lengths. Remove redundant member member_9 from previous iterations. Avoid adding many nodes to keep mass low. Use smaller area IDs (1 or 2) for some less stressed members. Try slight repositioning of nodes 5 and 6 to shorter members.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Maintain node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Adjust node_4, node_5, node_6 to optimize geometry for shorter and balanced members. Remove member_9 and keep 9 members. Assign areas strategically to reduce total mass below 30 while keeping max stress < 20.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Minimize member lengths and use smallest area satisfying stress limits. Node_4 at about (3.0,3.2) to reduce longer members to node_6 and node_1. Node_5 at (3.0,1.8) to shorten members to node_3 and node_2. Node_6 at (2.6,2.5) for good triangulation. Assign areas: 1 or 2 for short members with lower stresses, 3 for members with moderate stress, 2 for longer members with low stress. Remove redundant member_9. This reduces mass and maintains stability.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths, assign areas, calculate mass = sum(length*area density).
