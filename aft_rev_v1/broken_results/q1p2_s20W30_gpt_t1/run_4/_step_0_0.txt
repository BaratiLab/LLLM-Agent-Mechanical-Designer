Load at node_3 downward-left (-10N at 45° below horizontal). To form a closed truss, add diagonal members connecting node_3 to node_1 and node_3 to node_2. This creates a triangle (minimal closed shape). Supports at ends restrain horizontal and vertical displacements properly. Use static equilibrium and truss analysis to compute member forces. Select cross-sectional areas to keep stress within ±20 and minimize mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Triangle gives simplest closed truss ensuring equilibrium and load transfer paths.

Calculate internal forces using trigonometry and equilibrium: sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0. Calculate stresses = force/area. Choose from discrete area set the smallest area that keeps stress ≤20.
