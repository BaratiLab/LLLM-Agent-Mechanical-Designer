Member_1 has highest compressive stress. Node_3 can be moved vertically only; it\'s load node not fixed in y-direction. Members have varying area sizes; adjusting areas can help redistribute stress. Need to keep closed truss connectivity and constraints.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max compressive stress on member_1 (-13.06) and tensile on member_3 (7.24) most critical. Node_3 is at (2.0, 0.0). Vertical upward move of node_3 can reduce bending and compressive stress in member_1 and member_2 by better load transfer. Member_5 area is largest (4), others mostly 2, which is 0.782 area. Possibly member_1 and member_2 need larger area to reduce stress. Increase member_1 and member_2 area to 3 (1.759) or 4 (3.128) while reducing member_5 area to maintain mass constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try node_3 at y=0.8-1.0 to reduce compressive stress in member_1. Increase member_1 and member_2 area from 2 to 4 (3.128). Reduce member_5 area from 4 (3.128) to 2 (0.782) or 1 (0.195). Members 3 and 4 keep at 2 (0.782). Check mass and stress again.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Node_3 vertical adjustment redistributes internal forces. Larger cross section area reduces stress inversely. Reducing member_5 area (which is longest member, largest mass contributor) saves mass to allow other members larger area. Keeping total mass <30, max stress <30 bounds design. Load at node_3 downward at 45deg is balanced by members connected to supports at node_1 and node_2.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths roughly: m1: 2.0, m2:4.0, m3: 3.605, m4: 4.472, m5: ~3.2 assuming. Areas: previous m5 area=4(3.128), m1,m2 area=2(0.782). Mass = sum(length * area). New areas m1,m2 =4 (3.128), m5 =2(0.782). Length times area decrease mass on m5 and increase on m1,m2 but net mass slightly close to before. Adjust node_3 y=0.9 for optimization.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node_3 moved from (2.0, 0.0) to (2.0, 0.9). Members updated areas: member_1 4 (3.128), member_2 4 (3.128), member_3 2(0.782), member_4 2(0.782), member_5 2(0.782). Check mass (approx): m1:2*3.128=6.256, m2:4*3.128=12.512, m3:~3.6*0.782=2.81, m4:~4.47*0.782=3.5, m5:~3.2*0.782=2.5. Total approx=6.256+12.512+2.81+3.5+2.5=27.6 <30 allowed.
