Max stress ±30, mass ≤ 30. Closed truss means all nodes connected forming a stable triangular truss.",\n\n    "analysis": "The simplest closed 2D truss from 3 nodes is a triangle connecting all nodes: (1-2), (2-3), (3-1). This will distribute load and stabilize structure. Load at node_3 is downward-left (magnitude 10, at -45 degrees). Supports at node_1 (pinned) restrain all translations; node_2 (roller) restrains vertical. We assign member area sizes balancing stress and mass constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangle shape ensures geometric stability. Assume linear axial force in members. Use equilibrium of forces at nodes and assume uniform material. Member lengths calculated via Euclidean distance. Areas selected from given discrete list.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "To minimize stress, members under tension or compression should have sufficient cross-section area, but mass is limited. Start with minimal moderate areas and increase if stress exceeds ±30. Lengths: 1-2 = 6.0m, 2-3 ~ sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 4.0m, actually node_3 is at (2,0), so 2-3 length = 4.0, 3-1 = 2.0m. With loads applied, members 1-3 and 2-3 share compression/tension. Larger area in longer member (2-3) to reduce stress. Check mass = sum(length × area) ≤30.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: L_1-2=6.0, L_2-3=4.0, L_3-1=2.0. Choose areas: A_1-2=0.782, A_2-3=1.759, A_3-1=0.782 initially. Mass = 6×0.782 + 4×1.759 + 2×0.782 = 4.692 + 7.036 + 1.564 = 13.292 < 30 good. Assume forces split approx by geometry and load direction. Member forces scaled inversely with areas to respect ±30 stress constraints.",\n    \n    "calculation": "For stress σ = F/A where F is axial force. Load vector at node_3: magnitude 10N at -45°, components Fx=-7.07N, Fy=-7.07N. Using static equilibrium, forces distribute in members: 1-3 and 2-3 primarily resist load. Assume 1-3 in compression, 2-3 in tension roughly equal magnitude ~7N. σ_1-3 = 7N / 0.782 = ~8.95 < 30, σ_2-3 = 7N / 1.759 = 3.98 < 30 safe.
