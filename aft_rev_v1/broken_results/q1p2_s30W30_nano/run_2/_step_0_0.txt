To achieve a closed truss and reduce stress, add a node above the middle node_3, creating triangular members to stabilize. Use a new node_4 above node_3, at y > 0. Connect node_4 to all three original nodes forming a triangular/tetrahedral 2D system. This keeps structure statically determinate and better distributes load. Supports remain unchanged.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Plan: node_4 at (2.0, h), h to be determined (~3.0 for stability). Members: (1-3), (3-2), (1-4), (4-2), (3-4) forming closed truss.

Load at node_3 is 10 units at -45°, decomposed to Fx = -7.07 left, Fy = -7.07 down. Supports handle reactions accordingly.
