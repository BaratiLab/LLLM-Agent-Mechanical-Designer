Mass 10.58 < 30 is OK. Load at node_3 (-10, -45°) causes high stress in diagonal member_5. Need to reduce stress in member_5 and others below 30 by adjusting topology and member areas.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load on node_3 creates tensile stress beyond allowable in member_5, the diagonal between node_3 and node_4. Current members use area levels 2 and 1. To reduce stress, either reduce length, redistribute load, or increase member area. Increasing area raises mass but still below max. Node_4 placement at (2.0, 1.8) yields a short diagonal member. Member_1 and member_2 connect node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2 on base; supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) constrain structure. Current design is basic trapezoidal. Proposal: add a new node vertically above node_3 to redistribute load and create a triangular strategy, increasing load path redundancy and reducing stress. Adjust areas to balance stress <30 and mass <30.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Maintain support nodes fixed. Add node_5 near (2, 3) to create two diagonal members from node_3 to node_5 and node_5 to node_4, distributing load better. Use area levels 3,2,1 on critical members with highest stress expected on diagonals. Possibly reduce area on low stress members to maintain mass constraint. Total mass budget ~30 allows flexibility.",\n\n  "proposal": "Keep nodes 1,2,3,4 fixed. Add node_5 at (2.0, 2.7). New members: member_6: node_3-node_5, member_7: node_5-node_4. Keep base members as is but adjust cross-sectional areas: increase diagonal members area to 3 or 4 to reduce stress and reduce base members area from 2 to 1 or 0. This topology reduces length and stress in member_5 equivalent and splits the diagonal to two members reducing stress per member. Recalculate areas:",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 creates an upper triangle with node_3 and node_4. Load transfers through two shorter diagonals reducing force demand per member. Increasing area on new diagonals reduces stress. Decreasing areas on low stress base members optimizes mass. Maintaining pin and roller at node_1 and node_2 ensures equilibrium. The new layout provides stiffer, less stressed members in diagonals and reduces max stress below ±30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: node_3(2,0) to node_5(2,2.7): 2.7m vertical, area 3 or 4 (1.759 or 3.128). node_5 to node_4(2,1.8): length 0.9m vertical. This second diagonal very short, area 1 or 0 (0.195 to 0.782). Calculate member masses and stresses accordingly, adjust areas iteratively if needed to meet constraints.
