Mass 25.1 below max 30. Members mostly in mid-size areas. Load applied at node_3 with pinned and roller supports fixed. Node_1 and node_2 fixed at bottom corners.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max compressive stress is on member_1 (node_1 to node_3). Node_3 is at (2,0) which causes high compression in member_1. Members connected to node_4 bear less stress. Load at node_3 (-10N @ -45°) causes uneven tension/compression distribution. To reduce max stress, move node_3 upward and slightly right to reduce compression in member_1 and redistribute forces. This maintains node_1, node_2 fixed as per constraints. Mass is within limits; small changes to member areas can be considered if needed later.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Moving node_3 upwards increases member_1 length and reduces compression. Slight horizontal move helps balance forces. Maintain member connections; possibly keep areas same for stability.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Moving node_3 from y=0 to y=0.7 and x from 2 to 2.8 will increase length of member_1 reducing compressive stress by lowering axial force. This also slightly increases member_2 length but stress is low there. Member_3 vertical length reduces contributing to slightly more balanced stress distribution. Areas kept same to avoid mass increase. Checks on member lengths keep total mass <30. Safety factor in max stress improved.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "New node_3 pos: (2.8, 0.7); member_1 length: from sqrt((2-0)^2+(0-0)^2)=2 to sqrt((2.8-0)^2+(0.7-0)^2)=~2.9; area 0.782 constant; mass increases slightly but within limit. Expected compressive stress reduction ~20%. Max stress estimate ~10.4 < 13.06. Member_4, member_5 unchanged. Total mass approx 26.5 <30.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node moves: node_3: (2.8, 0.7). Members same connectivity and areas. Member length _ mass updates: member_1: length=2.9,mass=2.9*0.782=~2.27 (was 1.56); member_2: length=sqrt((6-2.8)^2+(0-0.7)^2)=3.3, mass=3.3*0.782=2.58 (was 3.128); member_3: length=3-0.7=2.3, mass=2.3*1.759=4.05 (was 5.277); member_4 and member_5 unchanged lengths and masses.
