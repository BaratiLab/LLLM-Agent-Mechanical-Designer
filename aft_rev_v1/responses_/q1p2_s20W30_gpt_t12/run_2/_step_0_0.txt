  "preamble": "Minimize stress in a closed truss with node positions fixed for loading and supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given 3 nodes with known positions, 2 supports, and one load on node_3. Need to form a closed truss, i.e., members connecting these nodes form at least one loop. Constraints: stress ≤ ±20, mass ≤ 30. Areas selectable from given discrete levels.",
  
  "analysis": "3 nodes at (0,0), (6,0), and (2,0) form a line. To create a closed truss in 2D, additional node(s) must be introduced above or below the line. A triangular truss with nodes (node_1),(node_2),(new_node_4) forming a triangle is optimal for stability. Adding node_4 above the line near loading node_3 to reduce stress and mass. Member forces primarily axial, approximated by static equilibrium in planar truss. Calculate member lengths, assign minimum areas satisfying stress, balancing load transfer and mass limit. Assume uniform material density, length× area approximates mass metric.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_4 introduced at (2.5, 2.5) approx. Mostly equalizes tension/compression in members. Members: (1-4), (4-2), (1-3), (3-2), (3-4). Including member (1-3) on the line ensures triangular connectivity. Depth gives better load response to reduce stress. Use lower area for longer members if stress allows. Estimate stress assuming load at node_3 distributes via triangular branches.",

  "reasoning": "The given nodes are colinear; need node_4 above to form polygon (triangle) meeting closed structure requirement. Depth ~2.5 units balances mass and stiffness. Connect node_4 to node_1, node_2, and node_3, closing the loop and enhancing triangulation for stability under load. Members cross in the plane with truss no redundant members to minimize mass. Area choices start small, increase only if stress exceeds 20. Approximate axial forces via static equilibrium: resolve loads at node_3. Member length help compute mass mass=sum L_i * area_i.Round length precisely. Stress ~= Force/area set ≤ 20; choosing area close to Force/20.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Members: (1-3) – line 2.0 units, direct loaded member; (3-4): vector difference (2 - 2.5, 0 - 2.5) = (-0.5, -2.5), length √(0.25+6.25)=2.55 units; (1-4): (0 -2.5, 0 - 2.5)=( -2.5, -2.5), length ~3.54; (4-2): (6-2.5, 0-2.5) = 3.5, -2.5, len ~4.30; (3-2): (6 -2, 0 - 0)= 4 length. Total lengths sum up area×length within <=30 mass limit; reduces areas where tension low. Approximate axial force in member_1_3 is high due to node_3 force -10 at 45°; distribute through adjacent members noting triangular geometry approximating internal statics. Use areas from set, checking stress ≈ force/area <20. If force=200, area = 10 units; scale member sizing accordingly.",
  
  "calculation": "Lengths: L_13=2.0, L_34=2.55, L_14=3.54, L_42=4.3, L_32=4.0. Assume vertical load component causes tension in 1-3 and compression in 3-4 and others, approximated equally. Load magnitude=10 * cos45°=7.07 in each axial component direction. Assign areas: 1-3 area=0.782 (area_id=2) for high axial force to keep stress <20. Others smaller: 3-4(0.195 area_id=1), 1-4(0.195), 4-2(0.195), 3-2(0.395 - area_id best fit approx 0.782 but slightly smaller to save mass but maintain stress). Mass = sum(length*area): 2.0*0.782 + 2.55*0.195 +3.54*0.195 +4.3*0.195 +4.0*0.195 = ~1.564 + 0.497 +0.69 + 0.84 + 0.78 = 4.37 << 30 limit.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All nodes connected, members create closed polygon. Stress estimated under 20 limit. Mass well within limit. Design respects given nodes, no duplicates, added one node for closure meeting stability. Areas selected to balance load, stress, and mass. Node_4 beneficial. Load/displacement resisted through triangles, stable and minimal mass.",
