    "preamble" :  "Optimization of 2D truss for load at node_3 with strict max stress ±20 and max mass 30 constraint.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Apply load (-10 at 45° down left) at node_3; supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller); nodes fixed at these positions. Constraints max ±20 stress, mass <= 30. Current max stress ~50.7 exceeds limit, mass 21.66 < 30. Need redesign or moderate structural reconfiguration and area adjustments.",

    "analysis": "Current design has stresses in members 6 and 4 close to 50, violating stress limit. High stress due to direct member sizes and layout that improperly channel load from node_3 towards supports. Member areas large (5,1) without optimization. The existing irregular polygon with node_7 adds complexity without sufficient stress relief. Members connected from load to supports are somewhat direct; mid-nodes might be repositioned to improve force paths. Structural redundancy and alternative load paths needed to reduce peak stress while controlling mass.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "The load at node_3 at 45° down left induces bending and shear effects making steep high-stress compression/tension members near node_1 and node_5. Moving intermediate nodes slightly downward and adding members spanning diagonally between load and supports can reduce stress. Use smaller cross-sectional areas for less-critical members, bigger in compression members. Remove unnecessary nodes or merge nodes 6 and 7 into a single better-placed node. Reassess member sets to require fewer, but efficient members.",

    "proposal": "Retain nodes_1,2,3. Remove node_7. Merge nodes 5,6 to a single intermediate node closer to load (3.3,1.6) for better force conduction. Connect node_3 directly to this new intermediate node, then node_5 to nodes 1 and 2 (lower than previous 2.2m). Use members: node_1-node_3, node_3-newIntermediateNode, newIntermediateNode-node_1, newIntermediateNode-node_2, node_2-node_1, and node_3-node_2 diagonal, balancing tension and compression paths with careful area size selection to keep stresses below ±20 and mass under 30. Areas to select mostly in 1–3 range except for longer tension members slightly increased.",

    "reasoning": "Simplifying nodes reduces complexity and potential redundant stress risers. A new intermediate node closer to the center of load distribution improves path of forces reducing stress concentrations. Diagonal members distribute tension and compression, dense area cross-section only at high axial load members (near load and supports). A triangular fra me for load window reduces deflection. Member areas chosen to balance minimal mass and stress limits per member calculated length multiplied area with basic axial stress sanity checks.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Length rough calc: n1-n3=2m, n3-nInt=sqrt(0.3²+1.6²)=~1.63 m, newInt - n1=approx 3.35m, newInt - n2 about =sqrt((6-3.3)²+1.4²)=~3.0m. For member with higher stress, area ~2 (0.782) to limit stress means force × length/area < max allowable stress. Max stress tolerance 20, cross sectional area scaled accordingly. Total mass approx sum of length*area values expected around 14–20 is feasible.",

    "calculation": "Members and rough areas: member_1 (n1-n3) area 2 (0.782), member_2 (n3-nInt) area 3 (1.759), member_3 (nInt-n1) area 2 (0.782), member_4 (nInt-n2) area 2 (0.782), member_5 (n2-n1) area 1 (0.195), member_6 (n3-n2) area 1 (0.195). Approx member length*area sum= (2*0.782)+(1.63*1.759)+(3.35*0.782)+(3.0*0.782)+(6*0.195)+(4*0.195) ≈ 1.56 + 2.86 + 2.6 + 2.35 +1.17 + 0.78=~11.3 mass well under 30. Expected stress below limits given increase in intermediate node and reduced members with large Diff areas.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "Verify load paths via new node layout reduce max tensile/compressive stress below 20 with mass about 11.3 via targeting minimal areas but higher for longer compression members. Remove node_7 reduces complexity, move node_5/n6 to intermediate node better load path. Ensure no duplicate members. Supports pin 1, roller 2 preserved; load preserved at 3. Node coords to reasonable optimization precision.",
