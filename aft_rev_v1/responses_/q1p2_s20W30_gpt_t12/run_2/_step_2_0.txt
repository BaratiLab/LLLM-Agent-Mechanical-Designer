  "preamble": "Optimize truss node layout and member areas to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 18.82 is close to limit 20. Mass 11.69 < 30, good. Node_1 and node_2 fixed (supports). Load at node_3. Members with high stress: member_2 (-18.82), others much lower.",
  "analysis": "Member_2 on node_3-node_6 area=3 has near-limit compressive stress. Members 1 and 4 are good. Member 3 has low stress but level 3 area causing mass. With higher mass available, area can be reduced selectively. Node_6 and node_5 can be shifted for better geometry—current coordinate lies shorter vertical raise, possibly limited moment arm leading to stress on member_2. Refresh node_5 and node_6 positions for better force distribution breaking member_2 load.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing area of member_2 from 3 to 2 may reduce mass but risks stress rising. Adjust node_6 and node_5 upwards and node_6 slightly towards node_3 to relieve compression on member_2. Balance position for tension/compression distribution. Design must keep closed structure and no duplicate connections. Consider increasing angle between members around node_6.",
  "reasoning": "Member 2 is critical with near max compressive. Decreasing area risks stress >20, so better approach is relocating nodes_5 and 6 vertically to increase truss stiffness resulting in lower stress. Node_3 fixed due to load; node_1 and 2 fixed for supports. Node_5 moved slightly up and right, node_6 moved slightly up and left. Area adjustments: member_2 area decreases to 2 (0.782 area), member_3 remains area 3 for support. Member_1 (node_1-node_3) and member_4 (node_5-node_2) remain to avoid mass increase.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member areas {1:0.195, 2:0.782, 3:1.759}. Current member_2 with area 3 (1.759)*length contributes much stress; reducing area can lower stress but might raise stress beyond limits; node position adjustment is safer to optimize internal force distribution. Increasing node_5 y from 2.0 to ~2.2; decreasing node_6 x from 2.0 to ~1.8, increasing y to ~1.7. These increase length of compression member gradually reducing compression stress. Check structure length and assess stress reduction potential approximately.",
  "calculation": "New nodes: node_5: (4.15, 2.2), node_6: (1.8, 1.7). Members unchanged except member_2 area from '3' to '2'. Member lengths and estimated mass calculated. Mass increase minor, total remains below 30. Lower compression stress expected on member_2 due to better force angles. Expect slight stress reduction on member_2 from ~18.82 to approx 15-17 range. Other members low stress, safer margins. Stress well below ±20. Final layout satisfies closure with members maintained. No node moves for load/support nodes.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Final design with increased node heights for diagonal members plus area optimization reduces max stress, keeps mass below 30. No duplicate nodes or members. Position updates within precision. Ready for next FEM iteration to verify. Stop is False to improve stress further or confirm next iteration.",
