Select appropriate members and cross-sectional areas.",\n  \n  "analysis": "With nodes aligned on the x-axis, current structure is colinear, cannot form a closed truss. Add a 4th node above line for closure and stiffness improvement. Position node_4 to reduce member length and distributed forces. Connect all nodes ensuring closed polygon. Since load acts on node_3 downward-left, adding node above will reduce tension in tensile members by sharing load paths.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) providing a triangular shape with three nodes below and one above. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_2 (optional diagonal). This creates two triangles: (1-3-4) and (3-2-4), a closed frame.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Closed truss is polygon with multiple triangles to ensure stability and distribute stress. Node_4 is above at 3.0 m to balance length and height. Use smallest feasible areas first, then upscale selectively on high-stress members. Area sets allow stepwise increase in area to reduce stress. Use equilibrium to balance forces at nodes and estimate member forces by method of joints. Assign areas to ensure |stress| ≤20, with mass from length × area sum ≤30.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: Use Euclidean distance. Mass=sum(length×area). Assume load transfer as axial force only. Approximate stresses = member axial force / area, target max stress ≤20 absolute. Areas chosen from dictionary.
