  "preamble": "Optimized 2D truss minimizing stress with current mass and stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Problem: Minimize max stress, maintain mass <=30, stress <= ±20, fixed load/support nodes, movable internal nodes only.",
  "analysis": "Current max stress 9.04 << 20 max allowed; total mass 21.78 < 30 max. Member stresses are reasonably balanced: highest compressive -9.04, highest tensile 7.25. Node_3 can move, currently at (2,0). Trying to reduce stress further by slight node movements risks increasing some stresses due to load concentration. Existing member area assignments combined with current geometry appear efficient. No violated constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Minor adjustment of node_3 position shows no significant improvement; member stresses may escalate or mass increase to reduce max stress significantly. Members have assigned sectional areas from provided discrete set, reflecting considerate distribution balancing cross-section and weight.",
  "reasoning": "Since max stress is well below limits and mass below max allowed, aggressive optimization may lead to increased cross-section or unsupported distortion violating constraints. Ehrlich balanced design already. Moving node_3 further complicates force flow and can increase stresses. Member areas (3,2, etc.) are appropriate given load conditions. Structure is statically determinate with pinned/roller supports fixed at nodes 1 and 2. Available nodes and connectivity form an already closed, stable truss. Continuing iterations likely marginal gains only.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Max stress = 9.04 < 20; total_mass=21.78 < 30; member areas mostly medium sized 1.759–0.78; node_3 on bottom chord near load application point is structurally suitable node location. Nodes 1,2 fixed supports, no movement allowed. Limited degrees of freedom.",
  "calculation": "Attempted to move node_3 slightly upward or downward by 0.1 units leads to max stress increase or mass exceeds bounds if member areas changed accordingly. Reducing member_5 areas risks exceeding stress limits owing to high stress (-9.04). Current area of 2 is good compromise. Attempting to reduce area or shift node further results in mass > 30 or stress > ±20 violation. Structure statically optimized for load and geometry.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints satisfied. Minor nodal shifts degrade performance or violate constraints. Current design is balanced in mass and stress under given load/setup. Recommend stopping optimization to prevent overfitting or solution instability.",
