Supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller. Current design has total mass 70.672 (too high). Constraints require mass ≤ 30 and max stress ≤ 20.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure is statically indeterminate with overloaded mass mostly from long members (#5 and #6) and large cross-sectional areas. Stresses meet criterion but mass is excess. To reduce mass, remove or shorten heavy members and lower section areas. Node_5 is far (3.25,4.1) causing long members and heavy mass. Members #5 and #6 have largest mass. Redesign is favorable to meet strong mass constraint while respecting load/support impositions.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Retain support & load nodes fixed. Remove distant node_5. Add intermediary node near load node_3 higher in y-direction to create more efficient load path. Use slender smaller area members where possible but enough to satisfy stress targets.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_5 and related members (#4,5,6,7). Introduce new node near node_3 vertically, e.g., node_4 at (2.0, 2.5). Member topology: node_1 to node_3, node_3 to node_2, node_1 to node_4, node_4 to node_2, node_3 to node_4. Use smaller cross-sectional areas selected per member length and force approximations. This generates a simpler triangulated design with reduced lengths and mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Eliminating node_5 removes long and heavy members, severely reducing mass. Adding elevation on node_4 closer to load node distributes forces more efficiently avoiding direct excessive loads in horizontal members. Use minimum area ≈1 or 2, increasing only where stress approches limit to control mass. Load considered applied negative 10 at 45°, creating tension/compression in short members with manageable stress. Structure is statically stable triangular shape with pinned and roller supports.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths for proposed members. Evaluate area IDs for cross-section based on required stress limits. Ensure mass = sum(length*area density) <30.

Cross-sectional areas (IDs): Assign \'1\'(0.195) to shorter members with low stress, \'2\'(0.782) or \'3\'(1.759) to longer/tension members. Estimate mass sum ~under 30.
