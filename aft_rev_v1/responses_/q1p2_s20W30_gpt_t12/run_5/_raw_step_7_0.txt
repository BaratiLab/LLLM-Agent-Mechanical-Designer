Current mass is 29.355 and max-stress 6.16, well below limits.",\n  "analysis": "Current iteration settles at max-stress 6.16 (comfortably below 20) with total mass 29.3552 (just within 30). Nodes at supports and loads are fixed. The structure is a compact closed truss with 4 nodes, minimal additional members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Mass distribution shows heavier areas on members bridging vertical height with largest cross sections. Stress levels are low and well balanced between tension and compression.",\n  "reasoning": "Further optimization by moving free nodes or altering members risks increasing mass or stress unevenly. The design has minimal redundancy for load paths and cross sections tuned near premium area sizes. Stress could only be improved slightly by altering topology, which breaks constraints or fixed point rules.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Cross-sectional areas selected: member_3 uses area \'4\' = 3.128, member_1/5 use area \'3\' =1.759, member_2 uses \'2\' = 0.782. The vertical node_4 is at 2.5, which is optimal for force resolution from node_3 load (-10 at -45°). Support nodes fixed at (0,0) and (6,0).",\n  "calculation": "Reduction on any area or node height compromises load transfer and stresses rise over allowable 20. Increasing node_4 height would increase member length and mass. Decreasing node_4 height or lateral move lacks benefit as current nodal location resolves load well. Adjusting member areas smaller will increase stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met with comfortable stress margin and close mass to limit. Small nodal adjustments or area changes degrade performance observed in history.
