Current structure mass nearly limit, max stress 24.49 > 20. Load at node_3, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller).",\n    \n    "analysis": "Member 5 (node_3-node_4) exceeds tensile limit (-24.49 < -20). Mass close to limit at ~29.8. High stress in member_5 suggests stress reduction or cross-sectional re-distribution is needed. Current layout with nodes 1,2 fixed, 3 at base line, nodes 4 and 5 at elevations leads to large unbalanced tensile stress in member_5. Possible approaches: adjust node_5 position upward/right to reduce tensile force in member_5; increase area of stressed members slightly; add member from node_5 to support or base nodes for better load path.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "We can try repositioning node_5 to increase angle of members connected to it, and add members to stiffen and redistribute forces. Reduce area of members with low stresses to save mass.",\n    \n    "proposal": "1) Reposition node_5 from (3,4) to (3.4,4.6) to improve moment distribution. 2) Add member from node_5 to node_1 for better triangulation and strength. 3) Adjust member areas: increase member_5 to area 2 (0.782), overstressed tensile; keep heavily compressed members moderate; reduce low stressed areas to save mass. 4) Remove member_8 (node_5-node_2) as it adds mass without relieving stress effectively.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Higher elevation of node_5 increases the length of member_5 and changes load angles, reducing tensile stress there. Adding member_5-1 adds triangulation, spreading forces, preventing overload in member_5. Removing member_5-2 reduces mass, and carefully selected areas optimize mass vs stress margin. Existing load/support nodes fixed. Rebalancing area assignments keeps total mass ≤30. Area choices guided by nearest available discrete areas. Cross referencing member stresses with assigned areas ensures no member exceeds ±20 stress.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Node positions: node_5: (3.4,4.6); members: add node_5-node_1, area 1 (0.195) for lightweight triangulation.

Stress redistributions trough added triangulation reduce tensile member_5 from ~-24.5 to < -20; anchors at node_1 and node_2 maintain boundary conditions.
