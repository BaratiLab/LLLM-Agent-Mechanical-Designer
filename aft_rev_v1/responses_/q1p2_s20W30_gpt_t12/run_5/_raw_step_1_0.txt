Current max stress ~46 >> limit, total mass 11.4 < 30. Load on node_3 diagonally down-left; supports at node_1(pinned), node_2(roller).",\n\n  "analysis": "High compressive stress (-46) in member_1(node_1-node_3) exceeds limits; other members safe. Current structure has a short horizontal base (node_1 to node_2=6m), node_3 along base, node_4 at (3,3) creates upper triangle. Members mostly low area except those adjoining top node. Stress suggests member_1 too weak or length/orientation causes excess compressive load. Need better load path, consider adding intermediate node higher near node_3 or reposition node_4 to better triangulate load. Current areas low (1,2 are 0.195 and 0.782? They correspond to preset areas.)",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Options: increase cross-section area in high stress members, move/add nodes for shorter load path members in compression. Can\'t move node_3 or disrupt support nodes (node_1, node_2). May add node between node_3 and node_4 or reposition node_4 upwards and slightly away for better triangular distribution, check member length and stress reduction. Possible to remove member_3(node_1-node_2) to reduce bending. Reassign member areas for more support members in load path.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add a new node_5 above node_4 at optimal y=4.1, x=3; reposition node_4 slightly right (3.25, 3.0). Change some member areas: high compression members get area_id \'5\'(4.887) or higher; reduce low stress member areas. Members connected: node_1 to node_3, node_3 to node_2, node_1 to node_4, node_2 to node_5, node_3 to node_5, node_4 to node_5, node_4 to node_2. Remove bottom chord between node_1-node_2 to reduce compression range and reliance on member_1. Reasoning: better force flow with two top nodes, higher member areas in compression zones, better triangulation.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Load is diagonally down-left at node_3. Current member_1 in high compressive stress due to bending. By adding node_5 above node_4, form strong truss with two upper hops distributing load efficiently, reduce high compression in member_1 by shortening member lengths, reassign areas to members under high stress to reduce maximum stress. Removing bottom chord (member_3) shifts axial depositions, reducing big compressive force on member_1. Area ids assigned to keep mass below 30. Estimating new member lengths and assigning suitable areas mitigates stress within limit.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: node_1-node_3 ~2m, node_3-node_2 ~4m, node_1-node_4 ~3.34m, node_4-node_5 ~1.1m, node_2-node_5 ~4.27m, node_3-node_5 ~4.17m, node_4-node_2 ~3.03m. Assign areas: compressive members -> 4 (3.128) or 5 (4.887), low stress members -> 1 (0.195) or 2 (0.782). Total mass ~ sum(L×area) remains ≤30.",\n\n  "calculation": "E.g., member_1: 2m length × 4.887 = 9.77 mass units, very high; reduce area to 3.128 (6.26) or 1.759 to balance. Others similarly tailored. Confirm final stresses using FEM approx that high compressive stress falls under 20. Approximate total mass around 17 < 30. Members reconnected for optimal redundancy.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify all members below ±20 stress, total mass < 30. Supports unchanged, loads unchanged.
