Current max stress 117.65 exceeds limit. Mass 28.9 lower bound but can adjust areas. Load causes too high local stress near node_6 and nodes connecting members 6 and 8. Need simpler design reducing stressed members and redistribute forces.",\n  "analysis": "High stress in member_8 (node_6-node_4), member_6 (node_4-node_5), and member_7 (node_3-node_5). Node_6 near center adds complexity and stress concentration, likely added to reduce mass but increases stress beyond limits. Member_8 has highest stress and mass is moderate. Using large area 3 on members near highly loaded areas leads to stress exceeding allowable bounds. Area reduction and member reassignment essential. Node_5 high in Y causes long members and possible high bending/reactive. History shows node_5 changed iterations, adding high mass with still too high stresses. Remove node_6 and node_5 to reduce complexity, limit members to direct triangulated framework to balance stress and mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on 4 nodes (fixed) plus only node_4 placed optimally above node 3 - isolate load path as truss around node_3, avoid long slender members with high stress. Use multiple smaller/medium area members to distribute load. From earlier step_2 structure, more stable structure with 5 members and moderate mass and stress but still slightly over stress. Increase area on triangle members from step_2 adapted for stress requirements but keep mass ≤30.",\n  "proposal": "Use primary nodes {\'node_1\', \'node_2\', \'node_3\', \'node_4\'} - node_4 located near midpoint above node_3 for effective triangulation. Connect all edges as triangle: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2. Areas chosen: Big areas on inclined loaded members where compression and tension max out around 20 limit. Minimal areas on horizontal ties to reduce mass.",\n  "reasoning": "Remove complex nodes increasing stress peaks (node_5, node_6). Apply triangulation to assure rigidity with minimal members.Force angle at node_3 (-10 N at 45° downwards) is mainly tensile on node_1-node_3 and compressive on node_3-node_4. Area distribution based on length and stress to keep members within stress limit ±20 and total mass ≤30. Used last stable arrangement from previous iterations but optimized areas to keep max stress at or below limit. Horizontal member areas kept minimal to save mass as forces are relatively low there.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculation, stresses roughly at/under ±20: member_1 (node_1-node_3) length=2.0. Area=1 (0.195) too small in historical step, area=3 (1.759) used here. Member_2 (node_3-node_2) length=4. Supporting small tensile/compressive stress. Member_3 (node_1-node_4) length= approx 2.92. Member_4 (node_4-node_2) length approx 4.47. Member_5 (node_3-node_4) length approx 2.5. Area distribution weighted by length and force: larger areas (3 to 4) on members around node_3 to reduce stress, smaller area (1) on horizontal are okay. Calculations estimate mass sum near 23-24, safely below 30 threshold.",\n  "calculation": "member lengths [approx]: member_1: 2.0, member_2: 4.0, member_3: 2.92, member_4: 4.47, member_5: 2.5. Areas from code: \'1\'=0.195, \'2\'=0.782, \'3\'=1.759, \'4\'=3.128. Mass = length * area (mass coefficient 1 used per unit area). sum mass= (2*1.759) + (4*0.782) + (2.92*3.128) + (4.47*3.128) + (2.5*1.759) approx 3.518 + 3.128 + 9.127 + 13.978 + 4.397 = 34.15 slightly above constrain so reduce some areas: reduce at member_4 from \'4\' to \'3\' => 4.47*1.759=7.857 . New total mass approx 3.518 + 3.128 + 9.127 + 7.857 + 4.397 = 27.7 less than 30.
