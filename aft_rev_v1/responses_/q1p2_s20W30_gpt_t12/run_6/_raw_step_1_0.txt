Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Original nodes fixed except movable ones. Need to limit max stress from 52.38 to <=20, keep mass ≤ 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Original design stressed member_1 at -52.38 far above -20 allowable. Max mass 10.25, so plenty of margin on mass. Stress concentrated in members connected to node_3, which withstands load. Adding bracing or redistributing nodes can reduce member forces. Node_3\'s horizontal position at 2.0 is close to fixed support, compressing members. Node_4 at (2,3) supports vertical itself but load angle means diagonal members carry shear/tension.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider increasing number of nodes near load for force redistribution. Keep supports at (0,0), (6, 0). Add a node between node_3 and node_4 upwards to redistribute force. Increase cross-sectional areas on highly stressed members correctly. Use area_ids as integers from 0-10 for clarity.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Maintain node_1 (0.0,0.0), node_2 (6.0,0.0), node_3 (2.0,0.0), add node_5 at (3.8,1.8) to provide additional bracing creating multiple load paths. Connect members: node_1-node_3 (2), node_3-node_5 (4), node_5-node_2 (2), node_1-node_4 (2), node_4-node_5 (2), node_4-node_2 (1). Choose areas to keep stresses within ±20 and mass ≤ 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 provides intermediate support near load; this reduces force in node_3-node_2 and node_3-node_4 members. Increased area on primary load path members reduces stress. Areas selected considering member length and load to keep mass below 30. Slender members assigned low area to save mass. Existing supports kept to avoid instability. Structure forms stable trapezoidal geometry with triangulated bracing.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths then compute expected forces under given load angle. Adjust area based on stress = Force / Area model to constrain within ±20. Total mass = sum(length * area from selector) must remain ≤30. Recommended areas for high force members from 3–6 range; low force members at 1–2.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths: (1-3): 2.0, (3-5): distance between (2,0) and (3.8,1.8) ≈ 2.42, (5-2): distance (3.8,1.8)-(6,0) ≈2.68, (1-4): sqrt(0^2 + 3^2)=3.0, (4-5): distance between (2,3)-(3.8,1.8) ≈2.26, (4-2)=distance (2,3)-(6,0)=5.0. With areas chosen: m=(length*area_density) sum <=30. Example areas: member_1=2 (0.782), member_2=4 (3.128), member_3=2 (0.782), member_4=2 (0.782), member_5=1 (0.195), member_6=1 (0.195).
