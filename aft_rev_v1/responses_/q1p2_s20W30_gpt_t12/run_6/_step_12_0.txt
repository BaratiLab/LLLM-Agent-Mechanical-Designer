  "preamble": "Current truss design meets stress and mass constraints with improved stress distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "The current structure's max stress is 12.22<20, and total mass 17.27<30, within constraints. No support or load nodes moved, nodal positions for optimization are limited to intermediate nodes.",
  
  "analysis": "Maximum stress reduced substantially below Â±20 limit, all members' stresses are low and balanced. Mass is moderate and well below 30. Member areas mostly size 2 (0.782) and some size 3 and 1 chosen, supporting the shape. The geometry supports static stability with pinned and roller supports at ends. No constraint violation or excessive local stresses.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further stress reduction now marginal with current node positions and member sizing. Focus on stress uniformity and mass balance achieved. Structural topology introduces sufficient load paths and redundancy.",
  
  "reasoning": "Given constraints, the current design yields a low max stress (12.22 vs 20 allowed) with feasible mass of 17.27 vs max 30. Areas assigned are reasonable for carrying loads with lower stress. Node placement near midsection provides effective load transfer between fixed ends. Members form stabilizing triangles promoting stiffness. Moving nonfixed nodes likely yields only slight gains given constraint margins now, and trade-off with complexity/mass arises.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member stresses: min around -12.2, max 5.4, well within limits. Mass is sum member lengths x thickness areas from given areas set, within limits. Node displacements for load and supports fixed, intermediate nodes optimized within tight spatial vicinity already for balanced load flow.",
  
  "calculation": "No explicit recalculation performed. Current node positions optimized in previous iterations to yield low stresses. Member area selection aligns with moderate stress levels indicating no oversizing or undersizing significantly affecting global results.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Design meets constraints: max tensile/compressive stress Â±20, mass below 30. No violated constraints. Node positions paramagnetic optimally placed given the load, support layout, and member topology to minimize residual stress. Further iteration unlikely yields significant improvements without topology changes forbidden by constraints.",
