  "preamble": "Optimize a closed 2D truss to minimize stress and mass under given loads and supports with constraints on max stress and mass.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given 3 nodes with load at node_3 and supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Need a closed structure, so members must form at least one closed loop connecting all nodes. Constraints: stress ≤ ±20, mass ≤ 30. Areas selected from given discrete set. First iteration, no node repositioning except optimizing connectivity.",
  
  "analysis": "Node positions fixed: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0). Load of -10N at 45° downward left on node_3. Truss must be statically stable and closed. Current nodes collinear except node_3 is between node_1 and node_2 along x-axis; no height difference (collinear on x-axis). To form a closed structure in 2D, need at least one node not collinear, i.e., elevated vertically to form triangle. Since node_3 (2,0) is on line between zero and node_2 (6,0), no triangle currently formed, structure unstable. I must add a new node with vertical offset from this line to form a triangle and ensure closure and stability. The problem states no duplicate nodes and no changes to given nodes locations; so I introduce one new node (node_4) above node_3 along y-axis to form a triangle (non-collinear) for closure.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding node_4 at (2.0, y>0), connect members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_3-node_1, node_3-node_2 to create closed loop. Use minimal areas to keep mass low while keeping stress constraint. Assume linear elastic axial members. Truss structure resembles a triangle with a vertical node_4 on top and connecting node_3 inside. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) stabilize the structure against movement. Use simple formulas for force equilibrium and stress estimation based on member forces assuming loads propagate through the triangular top.",
  
  "reasoning": "To minimize stress and mass, pick smallest member areas sufficient for max stress limit and minimal total length sum. Member lengths calculated to get mass: sum(length × area). Stress in members approximated by axial force = load projections along the member divided by area. Introducing node_4 above node_3 breaks collinearity, stabilizes structure. Given -10 N at 45°, resolved loads on members sharing node_3 approximate bending effect is replaced by average axial load. Approximate maximal forces on key members to check allowable stress. Select areas from given discrete set {0 to 10}. Iteratively select areas testing max stress under ±20, mass under 30.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: node_4 placed at (2.0, 3.0) for simplicity, height = 3 (half of base length 6). Member lengths: L(node_1-node_4)=sqrt((2-0)^2+3^2)=3.61, L(node_2-node_4)=sqrt((6-2)^2+3^2)=5.0 approx, L(node_4-node_3)=3.0 (vertical distance), L(node_3-node_1)=2.0, L(node_3-node_2)=4.0. Total length summed weighted by areas gives mass. Use axial force ≈ load allocated assuming simplified truss joint equilibrium. Areas selected to keep stress under 20 and mass ≤ 30 combined.",
  
  "calculation": "Calculate member lengths precisely:\nL_1-4 = sqrt((2-0)^2 + (3-0)^2) = sqrt(4 + 9) = 3.6056\nL_2-4 = sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-3)^2) = sqrt(16 + 9) = 5.0\nL_4-3 = vertical = 3.0 (3-0)\nGiven node_3 lies on base line, L_3-1 = 2.0, L_3-2=4.0\nSelect areas (initial guess):\n- For major load-bearing members node_3-node_4, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2 usebereich 4 (3.128)\n- For base members node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2 use smaller(area 1 =0.195) to save mass\nCalculate mass:\nMass = sum of length × area\n= 3.6056*3.128 + 5.0*3.128 + 3.0*3.128 + 2.0*0.195 + 4.0*0.195\n= 11.29 + 15.64 + 9.384 + 0.39 + 0.78 = 37.5 >30 too high\nReduce member areas:\nSet top members to area 2 (0.782)\nMass = 3.6056*0.782 + 5.0*0.782 +3.0*0.782 + 2.0*0.195 + 4.0*0.195\n= 2.82 + 3.91 + 2.35 + 0.39+ 0.78 = 10.28 < 30 good\nCheck stress:\nForce max applied at node_3: -10 N at -45°, loads distributed leading to maximum approx tension or compression force approx 10 N per key members,\ncross-section area = 0.782\nStress = Force/Area ≈ 10/0.782 = 12.8 < 20 OK\nVerify support stability, closed truss with all nodes connected. Achieved triangle closure with node_4. Structure stable and minimal mass below limit.",
