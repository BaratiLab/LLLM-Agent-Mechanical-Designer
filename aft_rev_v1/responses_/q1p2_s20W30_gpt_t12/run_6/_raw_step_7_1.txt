Load on node_3, supports fixed. Structure stable and stresses well controlled.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress is well below constraints at 11.45, mass is moderate. Some members carry near zero stress, could reduce these. High area members (3) can be reduced if stress allows. Nodes node_1, node_2, and node_3 fixed to maintain support and load conditions. Node_4, node_5, node_6, node_7 can slightly move to further lower stress concentrations.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 has area 3 but low stress (0.98), member_4 stress is zero, can reduce area. Members 6 and 7 are just within limit area 2 but large compressive stress -8.72, -11.45 respectively, slight node repositioning may reduce these.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Reducing area where stress low reduces mass, but priority here is stress minimization. Slight reposition of node_6 and node_7 upwards and closer to reduce compression force, node_5 slightly adjusted to improve force flow. Keep triangles without degenerated members to maintain closed convex shape and stability. Remove member_4 to simplify and lower zero stress member weight. Reassign its function to members_3 and 6 to optimize load path. Use areas 2 or 1 as needed.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Keep node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0) fixed. Move node_4 from (2,3) to (2,3.2), node_5 from (4,1.8) to (3.8,1.6), node_6 from (3,3.5) to (3.2,3.8), node_7 from (3,2.5) to (3.1, 2.2). Remove member_4 (node_7-node_5), add member_8 (node_4-node_5 area 1) if needed for geometry. Adjust member areas to mostly \'2\' or \'1\'.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Expected reduction in compressive forces in members 6,7 due to node closer to load path, member_4 mass removed ~2.15, total mass ~15 reduction, new mass estimate ~15 total.
