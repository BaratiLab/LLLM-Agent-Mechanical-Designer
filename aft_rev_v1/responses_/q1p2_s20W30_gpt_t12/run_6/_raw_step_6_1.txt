Max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current max stress 103 > 20, mass 19.27 < 30. Need significant stress reduction, must redesign for better force paths.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current structure has multiple stress violations, highest compressive stress caused by member_4. Often tension-compression cycles at node_4 and along members connected cause excessive stress. The asymmetric load at node_3 (-45°) needs better bracing. Member areas up to 3 are used, but no large sections to reduce stress. Nodes behind load paths shall improve distribution and reduce stress concentration.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Improve load path from node_3 to supports through nearby triangulation. Introduce an additional node above node_7 between node_4 and node_7 for stronger bracing; remove or reroute high-stress members. Consider light members for low force members. Use higher area IDs on critical tension/compression members. Keep support and load nodes fixed. Aim for triangulated truss with strong diagonals to avoid bending; optimize member layout and area sizes considering length and load balance.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add a new quiet node \'node_6\' near middle of vertical height above node_3 and node_7 (e.g. (3.0, 3.5)). Members: create triangulation (node_1-node_4), (node_4-node_6), (node_6-node_7), (node_7-node_5), (node_5-node_2), (node_3-node_6), (node_3-node_1). Remove overlapping high-stress member \'node_4-node_5\' currently high stress. Use member areas 4 or 5 for main load paths; smaller areas for bracings. This will better distribute load and stay within stress and mass limits.",\n\n  "reasoning": "By adding node_6 at higher elevation near center, force flow will be diverted via shorter, stronger triangulated members, reducing stress per member. Removing problematic member reduces local compressive peak. The load direction suggests force path from node_3 diagonally towards node_6 and node_1 supports, while upper node_6 relays force efficiently upstairs. The total mass will be managed by balancing area sizes chosen for the length of members, allowing max stress within ±20 and total mass <30.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assume node_6: (3.0, 3.5). Lengths: node_1-node_4 ~3, node_4-node_6 ~1.6, node_6-node_7 ~1.118, node_7-node_5 ~1.688, node_5-node_2 ~2.06, node_3-node_6 ~3.640, node_3-node_1=2.0. Compute total mass by sum of (length × area) with selected area IDs. Aim main members near area 5 (4.887), minor around area 1 (0.195) or 2(0.782). Total sum should not exceed 30 and stresses fit constraints.",\n\n  "calculation": "Member length × area contribution roughly: M1(node_1-node_4):3×4.887=14.66, M2(node_4-node_6):1.6×0.782=1.25, M3(node_6-node_7):1.12×1.759=1.97, M4(node_7-node_5):1.69×1.759=2.97, M5(node_5-node_2):2.06×3.128=6.44, M6(node_3-node_6):3.64×4.887=17.8 too high; reduce area to 2 (0.782) → 2.85, M7(node_3-node_1):2×0.782=1.56. Total roughly 14.66+1.25+1.97+2.97+6.44+2.85+1.56=31.70. Slightly over, reduce high area members (M1 area 4 to 3=1.759 → mass 3×1.759=5.28), M5 area to 2 (0.782) mass 2.06×0.782=1.61. Revised total ~15.3 < 30. Thus the selection is feasible with proper area tuning.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "No overlapping members; node_6 added at balanced elevation, providing triangulation for load paths.
