Must maintain these fixed nodes. Current max stress 79.7 >>20 limit, mass 12.6 well below 30. Stress heavily exceeded mainly at member_8 (-79.7). Need design that better distributes forces and limits long high stress members.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current design has 7 free nodes with multiple short members; highest compressive stress is -79.7 on member_8 between node_4 and  node_5 (area 1). Smaller area members next to this are overstressed. Need to increase member areas or re-route forces with geometry and connectivity to reduce stress hotspots. Also, reduce concentration near node_5 node cluster. Maintain supports at node_1 and node_2, load fixed at node_3. Area 2 equals 0.782 approx; smaller area 1 =0.195; currently used mostly 1s and 2s; member_8 is 1. Increasing that member\'s area can help reduce stress. Add diagonal bracing for better force distribution. Node_5 small protrusion seems causing stress peaks; relocate it closer to node_4 or node_7 to better share forces. Minor vertical adjustment of node_6 and node_7 can offer force path variation. Limit design change extent to avoid complexity increase. The mass required is below constraint; we can use larger areas for overstressed members selectively. Suggested: increase critical member area_8 to area 2 or 3; create bracing between node_3 to node_7 to relieve stress at member_8; minor node repositioning - node_5 y to 1.5 reduces length and improves force flow.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "- Increase areas : member_8 from 1->2 or 3. - Add member (node_3, node_7) with area 2 for bracing. - Adjust node_5 y=1.5, x=3.6 (lower from current 1.8). - Slightly move node_7 y=2.4 down. - Keep load/support nodes fixed. - Test stress reduction. Mass will rise slightly but still below 30.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Adjust node_5 from (3.6, 1.8) to (3.6, 1.5) and node_7 y from 2.6 to 2.4. Increase member_8 area to \'3\' from \'1\' (i.e. 1.759). Add a new member \'member_9\' connecting \'node_3\' to \'node_7\' with area \'2\'. Keep other members same as iteration 8 except update areas of overstressed member_8 and add bracing member.",\n\n    "reasoning": "By reducing node_5 vertical position, shorten heavily stressed member_8 and redistribute loading paths. Increasing area of member_8 reduces stress amplitude by increasing cross-section area. Adding diagonal member from node_3 to node_7 creates an alternate load path for the horizontal compressive/tensile forces from the applied load at node_3, reducing stress concentration. Slightly lowering node_7 improves truss geometry and force distribution. All changes keep total mass well below 30.
