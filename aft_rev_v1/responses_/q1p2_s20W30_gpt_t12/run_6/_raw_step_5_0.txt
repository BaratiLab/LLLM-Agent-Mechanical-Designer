Member_2 and member_3 show good stress but member_6 (node_6 to node_5) is overstressed. Mass at 11.53 is acceptable. Nodes 5 and 6 near load at node_3 are critical. The arrangement does not provide direct force path from load to supports causing high stresses.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Possible redesign should improve load transfer from node_3 towards supports by adding or repositioning nodes for better triangulation and force flow. Concentrate on reducing stress on member_6. Area assignments can be optimized; heavier sections on high-stress members or better topology with less eccentricity.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Remove node_6 to reduce slender members causing stress concentration. Add a new node closer above node_3 for better load path. Use triangular form between node_1, node_4, new node, node_3 supporting node_5. Add members connecting new node to node_3, node_4, and node_5 to spread load. Assign moderate cross-sectional areas accordingly.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By removing node_6 and adding a node near the loading point (say at (3.0, 2.5)) we form multiple shorter, triangulated members distributing the force better. The direct connection from new node reduces bending and shear on members linked between nodes 5 and 6. Assign area 3 (1.759) for high load members and 2 (0.782) for others, balancing mass and strength. Ensuring direct force paths with pinned and roller supports constraints for statics.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Estimate length of new members using coordinates and apply axial force equilibrium to verify stress. Check overall member lengths and total mass stay within 30, stresses below ±20 with moderate areas",\n    \n    "calculation": "Node_7 at (3.0, 2.5). Members: node_3-node_7 (length ~2.5), node_7-node_4 (~1.118), node_7-node_5 (~1.044). Old members node_6 elimination reduces stressed member length. Assign areas: members connected to node_7 assigned area=\'3\' (1.759), others area=\'2\' (0.782). Total mass estimation = sum(length*area weight IDs) ~ below 15, safely in limits. Stresses expected halved due to triangulated load path.",\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Check no overlapping members or duplicate nodes. Maintain node_1 and node_2 supports.
