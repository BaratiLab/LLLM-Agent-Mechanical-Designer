Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Nodes & members partially loaded; max stress violation at member_8 (-35.44 > 20 abs). Mass currently 12.9989, under max mass 30 allowed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Major constraint violation is max stress exceeding limit at member_8 (edge node_4-node_5). Current design likely over-stressing connection between nodes 4,5 and 7. Areas are mostly 1 or 2; reducing cross-section won\'t reduce stress but increase displacement. Total mass well under limit, so increasing area for critical members feasible. Also, member_8 has smallest area (1), consider increasing area there. Overall geometry stable but slightly rearranging spacing of nodes near load/members may help reduce stress. Additional diagonal/bracing can redistribute forces.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Key is reducing high compressive stress (-35.44) in member_8. Increase its cross-section area to higher area_id. Possibly add a member from node_5 to node_6 or adjust node_5 position slightly upward/right to shorten high load members and spread forces. Ensure no redundant members causing stress concentration.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep existing nodes (except reposition node_5 from (3.25, 1.65) to (3.35,1.8) for better force path). Add one member between node_5 and node_6 to improve force distribution. Increase member_8 area from \'1\' to \'3\' for stress relief. Retain member areas mostly in 2 except where above changes. This keeps total mass well under 30 but reduces peak stress below ±20.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Shifting node_5 slightly upward and right shortens heavily stressed member_8\'s length and allows load transfer more efficiently to node_6 via added member. Increasing area of member_8 to area_id 3 (1.759) reduces stress by increasing cross-section; critical to relieve -35.44 compression beyond ±20 allowed. Adding member_5-6 creates triangulation to prevent buckling and redistribute stresses, avoiding stress concentration. The rest of the structure is stable as is. Mass will increase slightly but stay < 30. Triangular bracing is efficient and common method to reduce peak member stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Area selection: member_8: 3 (1.759), member_5-6 (new member) area 2 (0.782).
