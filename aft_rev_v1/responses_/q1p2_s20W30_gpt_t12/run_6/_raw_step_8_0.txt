Max stress at 12.68 with total mass 12.4643 is safe. Load at node_3 and supports fixed. Some compressive stresses around 10-13, tensile up to 10. Moving internal nodes only to reduce stress further.",\n  "analysis": "Nodes at load and supports fixed. Members mostly low stress. Areas selected are medium (1 to 2) mostly, total mass low. Potential to slightly reposition nodes 4,5,6,7 to better redistribute forces. Member areas adjacent to maximum stress members could be adjusted. Structure is closed. Node 6 is high vertical (3.8), 4 and 5 near mid height. Consider slight uplift of node 7 and node 5 to better triangulate and balance forces. Refine member 2 and 6 area choices to lower stresses.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Maintain area sizes 1 or 2 (0.195 or 0.782) to keep mass low. Possibly increase area for member_2 (highest stress 10) from 1 (0.195) to 2 (0.782) for safety. Nodes 4 and 6 govern upper triangle. Move node_7 slightly upwards along y-axis to reduce stress in members contacting it. Keep node_5 slightly more central to distribute stress.",\n  "reasoning": "Stress redistributed by adjusting nodal positions to improve load path and minimize peak stress. By raising node_7 from 2.2 to ~2.6, force can flow better between nodes 6,7,5. Similarly, lowering node_6 from 3.8 to ~3.5 reduces overly long member stress. Slight shift of node_5 left and up to (3.6,1.8) improves triangulation with node_4 and node_7. Slightly increase area of member_2 and member_5 to 0.782 (area_id=2). Member areas 1->2 keep mass near 13, still under max mass 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Nodal adjustments within limits: node_3 fixed at (2,0), supports at (0,0) and (6,0). Calculate length of members and estimate mass: sum(member length × area) < 30. Stress expected to be reduced due to improved force flow—max reduced from ~12.7 to under 10 by flattening node_6 and raising node_7. Maintain closed structure connectivity as currently defined.",\n  "calculation": "Member lengths estimate: member_2 (node_4 to node_6) shortened; member_3 and member_7 should balance tension and compression due to node shifts. Expected total mass ~13 to 14, stress reduced by ~20%. Exact recalculation requires FEM, accepted as approximation here. Verified area and node limits conditions met.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Result expected: max stress ≤ 10, total mass ≤14, no constraint violation, improved stress distribution.
