Need to create closed truss—must connect all nodes and form loops. Constraints: max stress ±20 and max mass 30. Areas from given discrete set of cross sections. Objective: minimize stress while keeping structure stable and within limits.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Information: nodes are colinear initially, no vertical element to provide stability. Closing a truss requires at least a triangular loop. Introduce a new node above the x-axis to create a triangle loop. Moving nodes is not allowed, so only add new nodes and connect existing. Load has downward-left (-10, -45°) force on node_3. Adding a fourth node above node_3 at approx (2, 3.5) creates a triangular truss with sufficient height to reduce axial force magnitude and moments. Members should connect node_1, node_2, node_3, and the new node_4 to create closed polygons.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Plan: add node_4 at (2, 3.5). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_2 (existing baseline), node_3-node_4, node_4-node_1, node_4-node_2. This forms a diamond shaped closed loop increasing rigidity. Estimate stresses using equilibrium. Select cross-sectional areas balancing small mass and max stress limit ±20. Approximating stress with member forces divided by area, assuming mainly axial forces.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Closed loop truss requires at least 4 members forming a polygon. Adding one node off-axis increases stability reducing member stress. Loads create tension/compression based on geometry - different areas selected for longer members with higher stress. Mass = sum(member_length * area). Verify mass < 30 from selected areas. Use tension/compression estimation from force balance at node_3: horizontal and vertical equilibrium decoupled with symmetric assumption for simplification. Use truss analysis assumptions: members only in axial load, pin joints at nodes.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculations setup: Member lengths from coordinates. Example: node_1-node_2 = 6 m. node_3 to node_1 or 2 distances accordingly. Approx forces at nodes using equilibrium equations: ΣFx=0; ΣFy=0. Use simplified trigonometric resolutions for forces.

Load at node_3 is 10N at -45°. Equilibrium directions: Fx= -7.07N, Fy= -7.07N. Solve member forces approx: Using equations from node_3 for balance. Member node_1-node_3 assumes compression ~10N axial force → area needed=10/20=0.5 choose \'2\' (0.782). node_3-node_4 tension about 7N → area=7/20=0.35 pick \'1\' (0.195 or \'2\' safer). node_4-node_1 tension ~7N → area \'1\' (0.195). node_4-node_2 compressive force ~7N → area \'1\' (0.195). member node_1-node_2 baseline support, assume near zero but pick smallest area \'1\'. member node_3-node_2 tension ~5N → area \'1\'.
