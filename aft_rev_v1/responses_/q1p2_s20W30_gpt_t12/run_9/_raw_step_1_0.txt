Load at node_3 (-10.0, -45.0°). Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Current design has overstress in member_4 (−36.26) and member_5 (+27.84). Modest total mass (6.019). Need to reduce overstress by redesign or re-assigning members and increase structural redundancy or stiffness.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design is a rectangular layout with a single intermediate node_4 above node_3. The load transfers mainly through diagonal member_4 with high compressive stress and member_5 in tension. Members connecting node_4 to nodes_1 and 2 have large stresses. Mass is low relative to limit. Areas mostly at low values (1, 2) except member_2 at 2 (0.782). Suggest adding one more node to create a more triangular framework, optimize areas to reduce overstress and redistribute load paths. ",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce compressive stress in member_4, provide more vertical support or diagonal bracing. Add a node between node_3 and node_4 to redistribute forces and add redundancy. Increase cross-sectional area in compression members while keeping tension members within allowable stress limits. Use areas from allowed discrete set. Avoid large triangles prone to buckling. Use node placements that favor load resolution into supported nodes minimizing bending moments.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 between node_3 and node_4 slightly shifted horizontally (to about x=3.3, y=2.0) to provide new braces. Set connections - node_1 to node_3, node_3 to node_5, node_5 to node_4, node_4 to node_2, node_5 to node_2, node_1 to node_5. Assign larger area to heavily loaded members (e.g. node_3 to node_5 area 3 (1.759), node_5 to node_4 area 3, node_4 to node_2 area 2 or 3). Reduce area on less stressed members (node_1 to node_3 smaller area 1 etc). Keep members connecting to supports with sufficient stiffness.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding an intermediate node divides large compression member_4 into two smaller compression members with intermediate support, lowering max stress. Additional diagonals provide better load path and reduce local buckling risk. Area selection follows member stress/order to keep stress under ±20 by adjusting section to required load capacity. This choice promotes structural redundancy and efficient material use minimizing mass increase.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Key members expected stresses reduced by shorter lengths and increased cross section. Load components resolved through multiple paths decrease peak member stress. Total mass estimated as sum(member length * area, approximate member lengths recalculated). Adjust area IDs selectively to avoid mass penalty while meeting strength.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Estimate new member lengths:\\n- node_3(2,0) to node_5(3.3,2): length = sqrt((3.3-2)^2 + (2-0)^2) ≈ 2.34\\n- node_5(3.3,2) to node_4(2,3.5): length = sqrt((2-3.3)^2+(3.5-2)^2) ≈ 1.92\\nEstimate new members at approx 2.34m and 1.92m;\\nSelect area 3 (1.759) to give capacity up to 20 in stress units.\\nMass approx member_3-5: 2.34*1.759=4.1; member_5-4:1.92*1.759=3.38, major increase.\\nTo compensate, reduce less stressed members to area 1 (0.195) to cut mass, e.g., node_1 to node_3.\\nTotal mass under 30 still maintained.\\nStress redistribution expected reduces max stress from 36.26 to <20 according to load path and areas assigned.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_final": "Ensure no duplicate nodes or members, nodes fixed for load and supports preserved.
