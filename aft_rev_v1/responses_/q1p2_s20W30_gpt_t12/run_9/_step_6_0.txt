  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to better reduce max stress while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective is to reduce max stress below current 12.13 MPa with total mass < 30. Support and load nodes fixed. Only node_4 movable. Member areas fixed from last iteration. Constraint stress limit ±20 MPa and mass limit 30 satisfied.",
  
  "analysis": "Max compressive stress member_1 = -12.13 MPa and member_3 tensile 11.12 MPa. Members near node_4 bear intermediate stress values (±4 to 5 MPa). Minor movement of node_4 could balance force distribution reducing peak stresses. Mass is stable at 24.9, within limit. Structure connectivity is valid and closed.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Current stresses are relatively low compared to limit, suggesting room to optimize. Key is how node_4 vertical and horizontal position affects force/moment balances. Moving node_4 lower (below 2.0) reduces moment arm off top chord, potentially lowering tension/compression peak. Adjusting x-coordinate slightly may further improve distribution.",

  "reasoning": "Reducing max stress involves better force paths and geometric improvement. Node_4 horizontally near mid-span is beneficial to share load between left and right members. Slight lowering from y=2.0 to around 1.8–1.9 can reduce bending effects. Small x shifts can be tested +/-0.1 to test sensitivity. Given past iterations, node_4 drifted mainly along y. Area distribution is efficient as larger areas follow larger stress members.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Estimate member length change per move: length member_2 (node_3-node_4) correlated with node_4 y. Lower node_4 reduces member_2 length, increasing stiffness along that member and reducing bending moments. Length RMS and stress scales roughly linear: lowering node_4 by ~0.2 reduces member_1 tension and member_3 compression by ~1 MPa estimated from deltas in previous iterations. Node_4 x-shift +/- 0.1 tests for marginal improvement.",

  "calculation": "Choose node_4 new position x=3.1 (unchanged, avoids excessive horizontal change), y=1.85 (lowered from 2.0). Keeping other nodes fixed. Member areas keep same as last iteration: 'member_1' area 2, 'member_2' area 3, 'member_3' area 2, 'member_4' area 2, 'member_5' area 2, 'member_6' area 3. This should reduce max stress (~ 1 MPa reduction predicted), keeping total mass ~ 24.8 (short slight tweak in member lengths), still below 30. No new members or nodes, unique connectivity ensured.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify chosen move logical and aligned with constraint satisfaction. Mass < 30, max stress estimated ~11–12 MPa after lowering node_4 is improvement. Nodes fixed except node_4 moved. No change to load or support nodes meets instructions. Structure closed with 6 members. Stress minimum near current found via iterative changes, continue next iteration if needed.",
