  "preamble": "Optimize node4 position to further reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives: Lower max stress (currently 12.19) and ensure mass ≤ 30, stress ≤ ±20. Constraints met so far. Load/support nodes fixed, only node_4 movable.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is member_1 tension -12.19, next is member_3 tension 10.97; masses and constraints OK. Node_4 position was lowered and moved closer to midpoint between node_2 and node_3 in last iteration. Further small movements of node_4 could balance stress more uniformly. Members area sizing is already optimized for minimal mass but stress can be balanced by geometry.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_4 has shifted down from (3.5,2.5) to (3.225,2.12). The side forces appear better balanced. Slight shifts more laterally or slightly upward might reduce peak tension in member_1. The length of members from node_4 affects their axial forces.",
  
  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 slightly more towards node_3 horizontally while retaining similar height could reduce tension in member_1 to less than 12, increasing member_2 or member_3 contribution accordingly but keeping max stress balanced. Keeping total mass nearly same by small geometry shifts without changing area assignments. Areas in members are optimal or close, changing node_4 only is pathway to further optimizing stress.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Shift node_4 to (3.05, 2.15). This preserves the triangular form, shortens member_1 slightly reducing its tension stress, distributes forces better along member_3 and member_4. Area assignments remain: member_1: 2, member_2: 3, member_3: 2, member_4: 2, member_5: 2, member_6: 3.",
  
  "calculation": "Distance node_1-node_4 new: sqrt(3.05² + 2.15²) = 3.72m (~from 3.87). Member_1 length reduced, tension force reduced proportional. Member_3, node_3-node_4 length: sqrt((3.05-2)^2 + (2.15-0)^2) ≈ 2.36 from 2.68. Balanced shifts reduce peak stress at member_1 and member_3.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Enforced nodes 1,2,3 unmovable. Adjusted node_4 to (3.05,2.15) keeping closed truss. Member connectivity unchanged, areas unchanged. Expected stress decreased max approx 11 from 12.19, mass still approx 25.3 < 30 limits. Constraints met, possible next iteration to continue fine tuning or stop if improvements trivial.",
