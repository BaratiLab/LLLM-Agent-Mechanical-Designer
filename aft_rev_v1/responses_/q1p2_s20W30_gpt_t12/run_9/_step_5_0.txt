  "preamble": "Minimizing stress further by fine adjustment of node_4 position.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 11.63 < 20, mass 25.2275 < 30, no constraint violation. Load at node_3, supports at node_1, node_2 fixed.",
  
  "analysis": "Current structure has symmetrical base nodes with intermediate node_3 fixed horizontally and top node_4 controlling stress distribution. Member areas are logical but some members like member_1 show highest compressive stress (-11.63). Moves on node_4 can reduce bending induced stress. Current mass usage is efficient relative to allowed max.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Hexagonal nature maintained; must keep closed truss formed by nodes 1-2-3-4 without duplicates. Focus on reducing stress of member_1 (major compression) and member_3 (mid tension 10.46). Allowed to alter only node_4 coordinates.",
  
  "reasoning": "Lowering node_4 slightly and shifting horizontally to balance force paths can reduce bending. Bringing node_4 closer to midway horizontally (between 3 and 2) may lower stress in member_1 and member_3 by more direct load transfer to supports. Maintain y>2 to keep structural height and close truss path. Balance between shorter/longer members and adjust cross-sectional areas selectively to reduce peak stress.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and stress ratios depend on node_4's position: \nMoving node_4 from (3.05,2.15) to approx (3.1, 2.0) to redistribute load; area of member_1 retained at 2; \nmember_2 kept 3, member_3 and member_4 at 2 as well for stress balance.\nMass limit reintegrated later.",
  
  "calculation": "Adjust node_4 to (3.1, 2.0) reduces bending moment around node_1 and shifts compression path closer vertically reducing extreme compression on member_1 (~-11.63), estimate stress reduction by ~10%, max stress ~10.5. Mass unchanged as member areas constant.\nNo nodes moved at load or support as per rules.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node positions and areas verified. No constraints exceeded. Mass 25.2<30, max stress ~10.5<20; clean unique nodes and members list; no duplicates; all constraints stayed intact.",
