  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss with imposed loads/supports under mass and stress limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress allowed ±20; current exceeds ±59. Max mass 30kg, current 21.6kg. Node 1 and 2 supports; load at node 3. Design to relieve concentrated high stress members, balance load path.",
  
  "analysis": "High compressive stress in member_1 (-59.47) and tensile in member_6 (46.3) exceed limits. Large member_7 length with zero area suggests it's unnecessary or causing inefficient force paths. Added node_5 increased mass and stress concentration. Existing diagonal members seem suboptimal. Need a better force distribution via strategic vertical and inclined members with moderate lengths and cross-section areas.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove direct long span members under low area. Re-arranging node_5 position to improve force trajectory. Consider adding another intermediate node to form effective triangular load-carrying paths to spread stresses. Use moderate areas widely, larger area on primary load bearing members, smaller areas on shorter, less stressed ones.",
  
  "proposal": "Keep original supports (node_1 pinned, node_2 roller) and load at node_3. Keep nodes 1, 2, 3 fixed for support/load positions. Remove node_5 from previous iteration to simplify geometry. Add node_4 at (3.5, 2.5) as an intermediate elevated node for load transfer. Members: node_1 to node_3 and node_2 (areas moderate), node_3 to node_4, node_4 to node_1 and node_2, forming two triangles to spread forces evenly, also node_1 to node_2 base. Adjust areas between 0.782 (2) and 1.759 (3) for better mass/stress balance.",
  
  "reasoning": "Removing complex added node_5 from previous iteration helped reduce mass and redistributed load paths. The new intermediate node provides a better triangulated system reducing high compressive stress in direct members. Using moderate cross-sections controls weight but ensures strength. Triangular geometry guarantees static determinacy and good stiffness. Choosing cross-section ids 2 and 3 represents areas 0.782 and 1.759, providing varied member stiffness and capacity while managing mass within 30kg.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "- Length calc: node_1 to node_3 = 2.0m; node_2-node_3=4.0m; node_3-node_4 ~ 2.92m; node_4-node_1 ~ 4.35m; node_4-node_2 ~ 2.55m; node_1-node_2=6.0m.\n- Mass = sum(length * area)\n- Assign larger areas for members with larger forces observed previously on ground base and connections adjacent to load.\n- Check compressive and tensile stresses expected lower due to triangulation and shorter members.\n- Ensure constraints met: total_mass <= 30, max_stress <= ±20.",
  
  "calculation": "Member masses:\n- member_1 (node_1-node_3): length=2.0m, area=2 (0.782) → mass=1.564\n- member_2 (node_3-node_4): length=2.92m, area=3 (1.759) → mass=5.135\n- member_3 (node_4-node_1): length=4.35m, area=2 (0.782) → mass=3.4\n- member_4 (node_4-node_2): length=2.55m, area=2 (0.782) → mass=1.99\n- member_5 (node_3-node_2): length=4.0m, area=2 (0.782) → mass=3.128\n- member_6 (node_1-node_2): length=6.0m, area=3 (1.759) → mass=10.554\nTotal mass ≈ 26.77 < 30 limit.\nStress expected to be reduced due to load path splits and shorter members. Areas adjusted for balance.\nNo duplicate members; no duplication of nodes; critical node fixed on loads/supports.\nPrecise float node positions followed.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Proposed design is statically determinate, triangulated, redesigning from prior higher stress topology. It maintains supports, load conditions, follows constraints. Expected total mass 26.77<30 and stress within ±20 limit due to more favorable member lengths and area distribution.",
