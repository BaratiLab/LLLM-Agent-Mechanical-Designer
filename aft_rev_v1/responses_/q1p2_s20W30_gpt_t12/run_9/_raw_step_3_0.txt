Constraints maintained, supports and load unchanged (node_1, node_2 fixed).",\n\n  "analysis": "Current max stress is 12.06 low compared to allowable 20, indicating potential to reduce stress further or reduce mass. Mass is 26.5, leaving some margin for adjustment. Node_4 is the only internal free node, influence on member stresses significant. Members toward node_4 have different stress signs, e.g. member_1 compressed -12.06, member_3 tensile 10.37. Current areas: mostly 2 or 3. Potential to adjust node_4 position to optimize force distribution and possibly reduce area of largest-stressed members.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_4 closer to nodes where compressive and tensile forces can better balance. Current y=2.5 at x=3.5. Lowering y moderately might reduce bending, tension/compression stresses. Also check horizontal shift near mid-span between node_2 (6,0) and node_3 (2,0).",\n\n  "reasoning": "Given the load at node_3 (-10, -45 degrees), traction in members around node_4 comes from force path. By slightly reducing y-coordinate of node_4 and adjusting x to balance the lever arm and internal force paths, stresses in highest members (member_1 and member_3) can reduce. Adjusting from (3.5, 2.5) down to about (3.2,2.1) will shorten members 3 and 1, reduce bending moments, diminish max stress. This preserves structure shape (closed triangulation), keeps load/support node position constant.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check length change estimates: reducing vertical component of node_4 by 0.4 reduces member lengths involving node_4 (member_2, member_3, member_4). Areas kept same as mostly balanced, but can consider reducing area on lower stressed members after reposition. Max stress historically on member_1 (-12), member_3(10), reducing lengths here reduces axial forces. Areas chosen (currently 2 or 3) balance mass/stress well.",\n\n  "calculation": "New node_4 coordinates (3.2, 2.1). Length changes: member_1 node_1-node_3 unchanged, member_2 node_3-node_4 length reduced, member_3 node_4-node_1 length reduced. Expected total mass roughly decreased due to smaller member lengths. Anticipated stress decreases moderate on max-stress members, likely higher optimization possible. Maintain member areas as before due to stable stress ranges.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify all members connected, no duplicates; areas consistent with constraints. No load/support node displacement; only move node_4.
