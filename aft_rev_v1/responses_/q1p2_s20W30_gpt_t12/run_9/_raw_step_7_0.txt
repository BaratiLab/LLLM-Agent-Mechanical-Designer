The mass is 24.545 below limit 30. No redundant members; closed truss. Stress distributions show some compression/tension imbalance.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Recent iterations moved node_4 mostly vertically downward slightly from 2.15 to 1.85 y-coordinate - reducing max stress from ~11.63 to 12.55 (a slight increase). Mid iteration stress variations suggest limited gains by adjusting node_4 only.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Load and support node positions fixed (node_1, node_2, node_3). Only node_4 position adjustable to balance forces and reduce max stress. Movement decreased height (y coordinate 2.15 → 1.85), attempted to reduce stress in heavily stressed member_1 and member_3 which dominate stress. Current areas are reasonable (area_id 2 and 3) to support forces, mass is also near minimal for this configuration. Further node_4 movement risks worsening geometry due to load path changes and longer/compressed members.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and contributions roughly optimized. Member_6 uses area \'3\' (1.759) with most mass, reducing its area would increase stress beyond limits. Member_2 area \'3\' might be slightly reduced but increases stress in member_3 and 4. Structural stability favors existing design.",\n  \n  "calculation": "No residual mass capacity to add stiffer areas to stressed members. Migration of node_4 outside [3, 1.8 to 3, 2.2] range showed past increments causing more stress, so current point at (3.1, 1.85) is close to local minimum. Thus marginal improvements unlikely by node shuffle or area assignment.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "No benefit in adding members (not allowed).
