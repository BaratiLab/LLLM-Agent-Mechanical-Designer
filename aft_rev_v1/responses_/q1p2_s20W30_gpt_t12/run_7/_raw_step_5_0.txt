Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current design max stress 36.26 exceeds limit, mass 19.57 < 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The main overstress is member_5 (-36.26 compressive) connecting node_3 and node_4 with area 1, small area inadequate. The load at node_3 forces compressive stress on that member beyond limits. Increase cross-section area of critical members and add bracing to reduce stresses. Existing members at node_4 tension/compression near or above limits require area tuning. Adding tension-compression balanced members can improve distribution. Add an extra node to optimize force paths between load and supports.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Previous iterations tuned area sizes mostly— introducing diagonal bracing inside the truss with an added node near top improves force distribution, reducing stress peaks while keeping area smaller. Reconsider area assignment and member layout for minimal mass while meeting stresses.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_6 at (4.0, 3.0) above node_5 at (3.5, 2.0). Members: keep supports and load nodes fixed. Connect node_3 to node_6, node_6 to node_2, node_6 to node_4, node_6 to node_5 with optimized areas. Increase areas moderately on highly loaded members. Remove highly stressed member_5, replacing it indirectly via new members through node_6. Adjust cross-sectional areas in the following manner to keep stress below ±20 and mass < 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Reducing stress in member_5 by splitting load through node_6. Diagonal members improve load paths. The arrangement leads to lower peak stresses, reducing required large areas on single members. Moderate area increments prevent excess mass.

Other members use small-to-mid areas where stresses moderate: node1-node3 (3), node2-node3 (2), node1-node4 (2), node2-node4 (1), node3-node5 (2), node5-node4 (2).
