  "preamble": "Optimization of 2D truss under combined load with pinned and roller supports to satisfy max stress ±20 and mass ≤30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load applied at node_3 downward-left diagonal; supports fixed at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller. Current max stress exceeds ±20 and mass under 17, need redesign.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design has a max compressive stress of -83.57 exceeding the -20 limit mainly in member_7 (between nodes 4 and 2). Mass is acceptable (16.96 < 30), but structure is overstressed particularly in diagonal members carrying high loads. The truss has many small inspections but stress concentrations are high. Nodes are arbitrarily arranged around (2-4)x(3-4.3), with node_6 providing vertical support. Current member areas are mostly 1 or 2, with only small diagonals area 1. Truss geometry and areas need updating to reduce stress peaks.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Minimize compressive stresses by better triangulation left side, redistribute forces better. Possibly add new intermediate node to reduce member lengths and create better force paths. Increase cross-section in critical members, remove weaker single area members on tension paths. Keep left bottom nodes fixed. Simplify number of members and nodes to maintain mass <30 but reduce hot spots stress below ±20 degrees.",
  
  "proposal": "Keep fixed nodes node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0) as is. Add two new nodes: node_6 near (3.0, 3.8) and node_7 near (4.2,3.0). Connect members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_6, node_6-node_7, node_7-node_5 (4.0, 2.7), node_5-node_2, node_6-node_4 (2.2,4.3), node_4-node_2, node_3-node_5, node_4-node_7, node_1-node_4. Use cross-section IDs (areas) increasing on highly stressed diagonals and shorter members to control stresses within ±20, and larger areas up to area_id 3 where necessary, while keeping mass ≤30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Enhancing triangulation decouples load paths. Nodes 6 and 7 added to create intermediate force flow reducing overlength and stress on behalf of member_7 in previous design. Balancing member areas with decimals 1=0.195, 2=0.782, 3=1.759 eliminates excess cross sections restricting stress. Avoid too small areas on high stress members and avoid too large on small members for mass. Close spacing at top nodes spreads compression higher and fatigue reduces. Node_6 carries load close upwards to load at node_3. Member_8 and 9 replaced to better pathway reducing buckling load on compressive members.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Check length of each member = Euclidean distance. Then Calculate mass = length * assigned area per member using {'0': 1, '1': 0.195, ...}. Keep sum mass ≤ 30. Check maximum stress ≤ ±20 based on chosen member sections related to load path. Focus diagonal from node_4 to node_7 and node_7 to node_5 for tension, and compression balancing from node_6 to node_4. Slide node_6 up to around (3.0, 3.8) for load channeling. Diagonal node_3 to node_6 with medium area 2. Check truss statics equilibrium (triangular).",
  
  "calculation": "Approximate member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0, cross-section 3(1.759), mass ≈3.52; node_3-node_6 = sqrt((3.0-2.0)^2+(3.8-0.0)^2)=3.83, cross-section 2(0.782), mass=3.0; node_6-node_7 ~ sqrt((4.2-3.0)^2+(3.0-3.8)^2)=1.44, area=2 → mass=1.13; node_7-node_5 (4-4.2,2.7-3)≈0.36 smaller, area=1→ mass 0.07; node_5-node_2 (4-6,2.7-0)=3.29, area=2=>6.47; node_6-node_4 (3.0-2.2,3.8-4.3)=0.94, area=2=0.74; node_4-node_2 (2.2-6.0,4.3-0)=4.54, area=1=0.89; node_3-node_5 (2.0-4.0, 0-2.7)=3.26, area=1=0.64; node_4-node_7 (2.2-4.2,4.3-3.0)=2.24, area=2=1.75; node_1-node_4=4.49, area=1=0.88. Sum mass about 18.3 approx, less than 30. This allows increasing critical areas on heavy stress diagonals but mass slightly larger enough safety margin on stress constraints.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Mass is summed to ~18.3 below max 30 representing moderate cross sections, expected lower compressive stresses with several triangulations and intermediate nodes; load path effectively transfers force from node_3 to pin and roller, minimizing peak stresses above ±20. No member duplications; member list cli supports and load node_3 remain unchanged. Node placement precise; minimal node moves preserve existing load/support nodes. Confirm minor node additions useful for structure equilibration and stress reduction.",
