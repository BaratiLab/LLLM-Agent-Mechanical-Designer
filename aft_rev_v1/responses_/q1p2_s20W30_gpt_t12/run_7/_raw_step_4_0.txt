Current max stress exceeds tensile limit on member_3 (29.05). Mass is acceptable. Load at node_3 downward-left. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Node_3 intermediate, node_4 elevated top node. Members connect base and top nodes but tensile stress too high in member_3.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current design over-stresses member_3 from node_1 to node_4 in tension. Member_3 area too small (area_id=1, area=0.195). Member also has small mass, but tension over 29 exceeds ±20 limit. Modifying only areas likely insufficient without redesign. Node layout keeps load at node_3; adding another node higher or horizontal to share load could help distribute force. Member members from support nodes to top nodes balance load. Topology can add diagonal braces to lower max stress and balance compression/tension, while member sizes adjusted for load capacity.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding a new node between node_3 and node_4 to split stress. Use larger area on critical tension members - available areas range from 0.195 to 19.548. Keep total mass <30 allows moderate to slightly larger areas on stressed members. Use diagonal bracing from node_3 upward-right to new node, and new node to node_4, creating a triangle to reduce tensile load on original member_3.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Add new node node_5 at (3.5, 2.0) between current node_3 and node_4. Redefine members with additional connections: node_3 to node_5, node_5 to node_4, and node_3 to node_4 retained but with smaller area. Use bigger area on members spanning load path (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_5). Optimize member areas for stress within ±20. Areas: node_1-node_3 (area_id 4), node_2-node_3 (area_id 2), node_3-node_5 (area_id 3), node_5-node_4 (area_id 2), node_1-node_4 (area_id 2), node_2-node_4 (area_id 1), node_3-node_4 (area_id 1). Structure has better load path with triangulation and redistributed forces.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Added node_5 splits tensile force in original member_3 so that load path distributes between two members. Larger cross section area on node_1-node_3 helps support loading – compressive stresses expected lower due to support at node_1. Reduced area on node_3-node_4 reduces tension there to under 20. Using diagonals improves stiffness and reduces member peak stresses. Member_5 (node_3-node_4) now smaller area as some load takes path via node_5.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Checked distance and area calculations: length(node_1-node_3)=2.0, node_3-node_5 ~= sqrt((3.5-2)^2+(2-0)^2)=~2.5, node_5-node_4 ~= sqrt((3.5-2)^2+(3-2)^2)=~1.58.
