Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Max allowed stress ±20 and mass ≤30. Current max stress 73.61 exceeds limit, with total mass 21.36 under mass limit. Need stress reduction primarily.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High compressive stress (-73.61) in member_7 (node_4-node_2), tensile stress 27.29 MPa in member_6 (node_1-node_4), and tensile stress 19.82 in member_3 (node_4-node_5) near limit. Member_4 (node_5-node_2) also slightly over limit. Current design shows stress concentration in top chord to support node_2. Areas assigned range mostly 1 to 3, some lightweight, causing over stress. Loading direction transferred correctly, but the top members around node_2 have large tension/compression. Slight vertical node to node_4 (2.2,4.2), could shift for leverage and geometry to improve stress distribution. Structure shape and bracing to be optimized.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress over limit, increase area close to critical members or add bracing to redistribute force. Avoid large areas in non critical members to save mass. Consider shifting node_4 slightly. Limit close stress values near top-right suggests modified geometry and member connections could help. Adding diagonal member or reassign some members\' area can help too.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep load/support node fixed. Shift node_4 slightly higher and left (from 2.2,4.2 to ~2.1,4.5), to improve top chord slope. Add an additional node (node_6) near middle top (~3.3,3.8) to redistribute forces. Use tension/compression members connecting node_3, node_4, node_5, node_6, and supports. Add bracing member from node_6 to node_2. Adjust cross-sectional areas: assign area \'3\'(1.759) in high-stress main chords, reduce low-load members to \'1\'(0.195), avoid the \'0\'(1) area to keep mass low. Remove member_7 which had high compression stress. Instead use multiple load paths through new node. This retriangulation should reduce max stress below ±20 and keep mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing height of node_4 improves leverage reducing compressive force on node_4-node_2 (former member_7). New node_6 and members create alternative load path, sharing load more evenly. Using moderate cross-section areas \'2\' or \'3\' in tension/compression load members reduces max stress without excessive mass penalty. Removing over-stressed members avoids high negatives. Redistributing forces with nodes inside triangle helps minimize stresses below limits. Reassigned areas ensure mass stays under 30 kilograms.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: e.g., node_1 to node_3 length=2.0m approx. Heights increased indicates better axial force distribution. Areas weighted by given mass per unit length; approximate sums kept in range 25-30. Target max stress peaks kept below ±20MPa, checked by qualitative load path assumptions and triangle design. Using known truss configurations as guidance helps.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths roughly: node_1-node_3:2.0, node_3-node_4 ~4.0, node_4-node_5 ~2.0, node_5-node_2 ~2.5, addition node_6 at (3.25,3.8). Main high load members assigned areas \'3\' or \'2\'. Members connected as: node_1-node_3(\'2\'), node_3-node_4(\'3\'), node_4-node_6(\'3\'), node_6-node_2(\'3\'), node_5-node_2(\'2\'), node_3-node_5(\'2\'), node_4-node_5(\'1\'), node_1-node_4(\'1\'), node_6-node_5(\'1\'). Expected mass about 27 kg based on lengths*area mass factors; max stress within ±20 after improved geometry and force sharing. Member_7 removed due to very high adversity and over stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Reviewed member connections to avoid duplicates. Node coordinates precise to three decimals to aid stability.
