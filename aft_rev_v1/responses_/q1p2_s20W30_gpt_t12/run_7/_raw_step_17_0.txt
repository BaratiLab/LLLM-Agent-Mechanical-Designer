Current max stress hugely exceeds tensile/compressive 134.45 with mass 16.29. Load at node_3 left-down (-10 N at -45°), supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Nodes 1,2,3 fixed in XY; nodes 4,5 movable. Current members mostly small areas, causing high stresses. Plan: Modify node placement for more efficient force paths, reduce overstressed members by area adjustments and topology changes without increasing mass above 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Observed member_6 between node_4 and node_2 highly stressed (-134.45) which is far beyond limit. This is compression failure. Member_3 and member_4 also exceed allowed stress. Member_5 and member_7 on small areas are stressed compressively and in tension. Mass is moderate but max stress fails badly. Likely cause: weak member_6 and inadequate load path from hinge to supports, and positioning of node_4 and 5 causing high bending and axial load mismatch. Reuse existing nodes at fixed points, add at most one node between or above nodes 3 and 5 to redistribute load paths and enable manageable member areas.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Previous very heavy members are member_2 at area 3 (7.5821 mass) and member_6 (1.1062 mass) failing dramatically on stress. Load vector suggests tension on nodes 1 and 2 via connected members. Suggest relocation of node_4 slightly to align forces better. Add a node (node_6) above node_3 to decrease local bending stresses and break triangles in the truss for stability.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_6 above node_3 at (2.0, 2.8). Modify members: Remove weak high stress member_6 (node_4-node_2 area 1), link node_6 to node_2 and node_4 for direct support routes. Change small cross sectional areas of members under high stress into moderate sized area (2 or 3) members for SAFETY but balance mass/add members appropriately. Proposed members: member_1: node_1-node_3 area 2; member_2: node_3-node_4 area 3; member_3: node_4-node_5 area 2; member_4: node_5-node_2 area 2; member_5: node_3-node_5 area 1; member_7: node_1-node_4 area 1; member_8: node_4-node_6 area 3; member_9: node_6-node_2 area 3; member_10: node_3-node_6 area 2.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Placing node_6 above node_3 introduces a shorter and stronger load path to support. Expanding member areas for load bearing elements like node_4-node_6-node_2 helps transfer loads safely and reduces extreme compressive stresses seen in member_6 previously. Keeping lower area members where stresses are low reduces mass overall (e.g., member_5 remains area 1). Requires checking total mass doesn’t exceed 30 and max stresses within ±20. Adjust node_4 position slightly upward to around 2.3 vertically observed to balance load transfer.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Length calc (approximations): L_m1 ~ 2.0 (node1-node3), L_m2 ~ height difference for node3-node4 (~4.3 - 0) ~4.3 approx, L_m3 ~ sqrt((4-6)^2 + (2.6-0)^2)=Values from positions smooshed roughly. Count areas mass to keep under limit 30. Member areas picked to reduce max stress based on history - member with highest compressive stress use at least area 3 or more.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths and weights sums: member_1 (node_1-node_3 distance=2.0), area 2 mass=0.195; mass=~length*area. Similarly, member_2 (node_3-node_4 distance √((2.3-2.0)^2 + (4.3-0)^2)=~4.3) for area 3 mass unit per length 1.759 ~ 4.3*1.759=7.56; reduce length by placing node_4 closer ~2.3 instead of 4.3. Members from masses sum ≈safe under 30. Stresses reduced due to optimized members.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "New node_6 (2, 2.8) provides mid support between node_3 and node_2. Removal of weak member_6 replaced by two members node_4-node_6 and node_6-node_2 with larger areas distributing forces. Member areas carefully balanced with conservative approach to reduce max stress to ±20.
