Current mass 36.14 > 30 max, max stress 19.12 < 20 limit. Need lighter structure while maintaining stress limits.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure adds node_6 for stability but mass overshoot. Members from node_4 to node_2 with area 3 (1.759) leading to heavy mass near support. Stress distribution uneven with member_4 near stress limit. Constraint on mass is binding, stresses near limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing member areas near high-mass regions like members connected to node_7, trimming extra nodes can cut mass. Replacing several thicker members with optimized lower areas and alternate shorter member connections reduces mass but must preserve structural integrity and stability against load.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Maintain supports and load nodes fixed. Remove node_6 to reduce node count. Adjust top chord nodes for efficient load transfer. Use lower area ID count for less stressed members. Provide diagonal bracing directly between nodes_3, 4, 5, and 2 with varied area sizes. Design members from node_4 to node_2 with smaller area considering lower stresses seen previously. Optimize node_5 location slightly closer to node_2 horizontally and node_4 vertically for better load path and reduce member length. Final structure: nodes_1,2 support base with nodes_3,4,5 distributing load; members sized to keep max stress under 20 and total mass under 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing node_6 reduces redundant complexity, cutting mass. Positioning node_4 higher and node_5 closer horizontally improves force distribution to support nodes. Choosing areas: higher for primary stressed members, lower for secondary members. Areas selected from {0 to 10}, picking minimum possible while respecting stress constraint. This strategy facilitates satisfying constraints and improving mass efficiency.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calc starts from precise node positions. Member mass = length * area. Lower area reduces mass but increases stress. Stress limit ±20 controls min area for loaded critical members.

Set node_4 at (2.3,4.3), node_5 at (4.0,2.6); Remove node_6. Evaluate member lengths and assign areas to keep stresses close but under 20.
