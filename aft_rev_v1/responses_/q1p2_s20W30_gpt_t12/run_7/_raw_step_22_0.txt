Nodes node_1, node_2 (supports), node_3 (load) fixed including positions. Others can be added/moved.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High max stress concentration on member_3 (node_4-node_5) and also high tensile on member_6 (node_1-node_4). Existing structure has 3 interior nodes: 4 at (2.2,4.3), 5 at (4.0,2.7). Loads and directions induce bending moment needing stiff vertical support members. Member areas too small to offset large forces causing high stress limit exceedance (±20). Needed redesign with additional node(s) to distribute load and shorten highly stressed members. Current topology lacks adequate triangulation to reduce stress in long members.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Discard member_3 (area 1, very thin but length still causes high stress). Need stronger triangulation near load and diagonal spanning directly from node_3 toward supports. Introduce one node near load but lower height to provide stronger distribution paths. Adjust adjacent member sections to balance stresses and stay within area limits (mostly in area 2 or 3).",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_6 at (3.0, 3.5) generating a triangular substructure between nodes 3,4,6,5 minimizing long member lengths and heavy stresses. Connect members: node_3-node_6, node_6-node_4, node_6-node_5 with moderate area. Keep members from node_1 and node_2 to node_4 and node_5. Choose area 2 or 3 for main load paths. Remove member with high stress (node_4-node_5 member_3), redistribute connectivity.

Moderate areas selected on load path members (area 2 or 3) to keep stresses <20 and mass acceptable. Smaller members areas (area 1) for stabilization members.
