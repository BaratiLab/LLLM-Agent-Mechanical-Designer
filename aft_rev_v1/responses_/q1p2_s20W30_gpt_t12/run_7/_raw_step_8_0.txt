Current max stress = 27.65 and total mass ≈10.17, mass allowable. Load applied only at node_3. Supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller). Keep fixed load/support nodes. Current iteration 7 topology: node_1, 2, 3, 4; members 1-5 with areas \'2\', \'2\', \'2\', \'1\', \'1\'. Need to reduce max stress from 27.65 to ≤20.",\n  "analysis": "Max tensile stress is on member_5 (node_1-node_4) at 27.65 (>20). Members with excessive stress cause problems: member_5 and member_4 (compressive -13.43) both exceed ±20 marginally (member_4 closer). Member areas for those members are too small. Heavy load at node_3 with downward left angle (-10 at -45°) induces complex stress. Current member network is a simple quadrilateral with a diagonal (member_4 connecting node_3 and node_2) plus member_5 diagonal from node_1 to node_4. Area selections can be improved. Should we add nodes to improve load path? Adding nodes over complicated prior approach that caused excessive mass (iteration_6, iteration_5) is counterproductive. Optimal solution should keep close to 4 nodes but reassign areas and members strategically.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Idea: Upgrade highly stressed members\' cross sections, eliminate member_5 or adjust its area and connectivity; add member between node_1 and node_2 base nodes to triangulate base for stiffness and reduce stress on long diagonals; perhaps add new node intermediate between node_3 and node_4 raised slightly to reroute forces; but constraint to not move load/support nodes. Trade-off possible increase in mass, but below 30 is ample. Use high areas for highly stressed members, reduce others to keep mass low.",\n  "proposal": "Add one new strategically placed node (node_5) to distribute stress at top; add horizontal base member (node_1 - node_2) for stability; redefine members with optimized area selection to balance mass/stress; avoid member diagonals that cause stress concentration. Final structure with 5 nodes {node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2,3.6), node_5(4.0, 3.6)}; members: base1 node_1-node_2 area 3; verticals: node_1-node_4 area 2, node_2-node_5 area 2; top chord node_4-node_5 area 1; diagonals: node_3-node_4 area 3, node_3-node_5 area 2, node_3-node_1 area 1, node_3-node_2 area 1. This composites triangulated load path reducing max stress with distributed stiffness. Areas refined to maintain mass below 30.",\n  "reasoning": "Increase base Member node_1-node_2 area to reduce base bending, strong base support helps reduce stresses in diagonals. Adding node_5 horizontally aligned with node_4 isolates upper load into two parallel load paths, reducing individual member stress. Maintain node_3 at load point and connect diagonally to node_1,2,4,5 to balance stress. Diagonal between node_3-node_4 with area 3 resists compressive load. Reduced member_5 like member_4 in first plan previously exceeded limits due to small area. Assign larger areas selectively to critical members while keeping other members minimal area to save mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths, approximate member masses with length×area unit approx to estimate total mass <30; driver stress reduction proven by triangulation/force path balancing.
