Mass is safe (15.87 < 30). Load on node_3 at -45°. Supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller. Previous design shows overstressed diagonal members at node_4 and node_2.",\n\n  "analysis": "Stress concentrations mainly on members connected to node_4 with area 1 causing high stress. Large axial forces appear in members 6 and 7 with undersized areas driving stress above allowable. Member 5 shows compression near limit (-17.47). Member areas vary; heavier areas prove beneficial but bring mass up. To reduce max stress: add bracing nodes and redistribute load paths to shorten and unload critical members. Slightly raise and reposition nodes near load node_3 and near nodes 4 and 5 to improve triangulation. Avoid members with low area in tension or compression load. Strategy should increase number of members locally but use moderate areas to limit mass.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Current 7 members design lacks sufficient triangulation near load. Adding an optimal node above load node_3 allows 2 triangulated load paths to node_4 and node_5. This can reduce stress on members 6 and 7. Using area 2 and 3 mostly, keep large areas only for longest members in highest axial force paths. Maintain nodes 1, 2, and 3 fixed. Slight uplift node_3 and node_5 for improved stiffness and stress distribution. Remove member_6 (node_1 to node_4) with high stress low area. Add members from new node to node_4 and node_3 with moderate areas. This balances load flow and relieves critical members.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add node_6 at (2.6, 2.7) to create a stable triangular network near load. Modify members: remove member_6 and member_7 current low area members with high stress; add new members (node_3-node_6), (node_6-node_4), (node_6-node_5) with area \'3\'; increase key member areas connected to supports to area \'3\'. Keep existing nodes for load and supports fixed. Connect node_5 to node_2 with area \'2\'; node_1 to node_3 with area \'2\'.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Adding node_6 improves load path sharing and triangulation near load, reducing stress concentration. Increasing areas to moderate levels (2,3) on main tension/compression members ensures stresses under limit ±20. Removing member_6 eliminates overstressed member connected directly to pinned support, redistributing forces through stronger paths. Locations chosen based on prior node placements and distances to minimize long skinny members and mass increase.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and areas for mass: Use member lengths in meters and assigned areas. Estimate axial forces based on improved triangulation; expect stress reduction below 20. Estimate mass = Σ length × area. Verify total ≤ 30. Checks: max stress < 20 (abs), mass < 30. All supports loads fixed. Adjust node_6 location if needed to control member lengths and better distribute load.",\n\n  "calculation": "Node_6 position (2.6, 2.7) chosen to form 3 well-length balanced members to nodes 3,4,5.
