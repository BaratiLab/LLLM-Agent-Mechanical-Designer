Load at node_3 downward-left. Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Max stress ±20, max mass ≤30. Need a closed truss (cycle) connecting nodes to resist load and ensure stiffness.",\n\n  "analysis": "Given three nodes roughly on same horizontal line, closed truss needs at least one additional node above to form a triangle to carry vertical/horizontal components and reduce bending. Loads applied diagonally down-left at node_3. Max stress ±20 limits required area on members subject to tension/compression. Mass limited: sum of length × area ≤30. Need minimal members yet stable triangulated shape.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add 1 node (node_4) above line near node_3 around (2,3.0) to form triangle node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_2-node_3-node_4. Use members: 1-3, 2-3, 1-4, 2-4, 3-4. This creates 2 triangles closing around node_3. By distributing forces through these, stress is manageable and mass constrained. Use areas from set to balance strength vs mass.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Triangulation is primary strategy: create triangle above line using node_4. Members connecting supports (node_1 and node_2), and load node_3 to node_4 create roughly two triangles. Load at node_3 can be resolved through two paths to supports. Areas assigned by approximate force distribution estimated through static equilibrium. Use member forces and length to estimate stress (force/area) and masses (length × area). Aim for areas large enough to keep stress ≤20 and mass ≤30 total.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear axial members, area chosen from given discrete set. Simplify load resolution by splitting load at node_3 equally to paths 3-1- and 3-2-. Forces in members roughly P/2 = 5 units for major members tension/compression. Calculate length by Euclidean distance. Neglect moments because triangulated, assume axial forces only.",\n\n  "calculation": "Nodes positions: N1(0,0), N2(6,0), N3(2,0), N4(2,3.0).
