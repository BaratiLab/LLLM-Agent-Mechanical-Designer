Current max stress ≈ 36.85 > 20, mass ≈ 33.86 > 30. Need lighter, less stressed structure. Nodes node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed in location (support and load). Other nodes and member connectivity can be adjusted for optimal load paths.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current structure is over mass and max stress limits. Maximum compressive stress (-36.85) occurs in member_4 (node_2-node_4) and tensile stress exceeds +20 in member_9 (node_6-node_4: 12.14) and some members under lower but still violate mass. Additionally, node_6 appears to concentrate stress and contributes large mass members. Suggest removing node_6 to reduce mass and complexity, keeping nodes between load and supports to achieve better triangulation.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "A simpler truss with nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0) [fixed]. Add one or two geometric nodes above to triangulate load path to supports. Use moderate sized members fitted to carry forces within 20 units stress and control mass distribution. Previous structures heavier or inefficient due to excessive members and large areas.",\n\n  "proposal": "New structure with nodes: fixed node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Add node_4 at (2,3.6), just above load node for vertical bracing, and node_5 at (4.2,3.0) for triangulation. Connect members in triangular pattern: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_2-node_1, node_5-node_3, node_4-node_2. Assign areas strategically to stay under stress and mass constraints.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Removing node_6 and related members reduces weight and complexity. Placing node_4 at 3.6m height balances vertical support for load at node_3 with modest height, reducing long, heavy members. Node_5 positioned closer to load path to node_2, enabling effective force transfer. Members chosen to allow load path in tension and compression within ±20 stress limit, minimizing required cross-sectional areas and thus mass. Triangular geometry ensures stability and force resolution.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Approximate lengths: node_1-node_3 ~2m, node_3-node_4 ~3.6m, node_4-node_5 ~2.24m, node_5-node_2 ~2.05m, node_2-node_1 =6m, node_5-node_3 ~2.7m, node_4-node_2 ~4.12m. Select smaller area IDs for longer members to save mass while maintaining ≤20 stress. Use larger areas only where needed over shorter lengths (e.g., node_1-node_3).",\n\n  "calculation": "Estimate forces: Node_3 load is ~10 in magnitude at -45°. Key transfer through node_4 and node_5 to supports.
