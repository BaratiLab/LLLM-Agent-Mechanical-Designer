    "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under given loading, support with max stress and mass constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress limit ±20 exceeded notably on member_6 and member_1 in last design; mass 22.54 < 30 max. Load is at node_3 downward-left, supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 fixed. Existing nodes for load/support fixed. Areas chosen roughly moderate to larger introduced in last iteration. Current max stress is 28.51; need to reduce by better member arrangement and sizing.",
    
    "analysis": "Current design concentrates stress at member_6 (node_1 to node_4) and member_1 (node_1 to node_3). Taller node_4 at (2.5,4.0) exerts longer length members that carry heavy tensile load needing larger area. Mass OK. Structure could benefit from eliminating redundant long slender members and better triangulation. Node_6 (added 3.5,2.0) helps load path but member areas are unbalanced causing overload on some members.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Main load at node_3 offsets toward supports 1 & 2. Reinforce members connected directly from node_3 to supports and intermediate nodes to distribute stress evenly. Reduce largest tensile member areas, move node_4 slightly to optimize force angles, remove node_6 for simplification and delete overlapped low stressed members. Try three-node triangulation for cable-effect to reduce stress in critical members.",
    
    "proposal": "Remove node_6 to reduce complexity. Move node_4 to 2.2, 3.8 to shorten and reduce tensile stress in member_6. Keep node_5 at 4.5, 2.8 to support lateral force appropriately. Members: 'member_1': node_1-node_3 area_2, 'member_2': node_3-node_4 area_3, 'member_3': node_4-node_5 area_2, 'member_4': node_5-node_2 area_3, 'member_5': node_3-node_5 area_2, 'member_6': node_1-node_4 area_1, plus add diagonal node_3 to node_2 ('member_7': node_3-node_2 area_1) to balance forces and reduce overload on node_1 members.",
    
    "reasoning": "Reducing node count decreases material but nodes remain stable with pinned and roller supports intact. Slight node_4 move reduces moment arm and load in member_6, reassigning area to lower cross-section for under-stressed members reduces mass. Adding member_7 (node_3-node_2) helps bypass load directly, reducing max stressed member loads shared at node_1. Cross-sectional areas chosen upright to maintain stresses below ±20. Designs aim at tightened members triangulation and balanced load paths.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Length and areas calculated approximately given distances. Using area mapping (2=0.782, 3=1.759, 1=0.195). Check length*area sums < 30 max mass. Lengths: node_1-node_3 ~2, node_3-node_4 ~1.5, node_4-node_5 ~2.3, node_5-node_2 ~1.75, node_3-node_5 ~2.9, node_1-node_4 ~4.4, node_3-node_2 ~4.0. Estimate mass ≈Σ(length*area): 2*0.782=1.564 + 1.5*1.759=2.64 + 2.3*0.782=1.8 + 1.75*1.759=3.08 + 2.9*0.782=2.27 + 4.4*0.195=0.858 + 4.0*0.195=0.78 Total ~12+ margin, well under max mass 30. Stress should be distributed more evenly, especially on node_1 members.",
    
    "calculation": "Total mass ~12 (safe). Expected max stress ≤ ±20 achievable by distributed members and sizing. Verify no compressed member area too small causing stress rise. Key tensile member areas (member_2 area_3, member_4 area_3) provide strength for direct load paths. Diagonal node_3-node_2 (member_7) with small area aids load sharing without excess mass. Expected overall improvement to max stress <20 and mass <30.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Confirmed all support/load nodes unchanged. No duplications. Areas from specified set. Proposed design simplifies and improves load path. Estimated constraints satisfaction with margin. Ready for FEM evaluation.",
