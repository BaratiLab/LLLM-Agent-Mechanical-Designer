Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current total mass 41.05 exceeds limit 30. Max stress 9.04 < 20 allowed. Member areas from 0 to 10 available. Need structural redesign for mass reduction.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has excessive mass mainly from large areas on members connecting to node_5. The added node_5 above node_4 increases mass but reduces stress. Max stress acceptable but mass overshoot critical. Members with large cross sections (area_id 5 and 3) contribute to weight. Current layout with long vertical members is heavy. Load at node_3 should be distributed efficiently to support nodes 1 and 2. Aim for minimal members and optimized topology.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider removing node_5 to reduce mass. Use direct triangulation between node_1, node_2, node_3 and node_4 to create stable truss. Optimize member cross sections to minimal enough for stress ≤ 20 but keeping mass ≤ 30. Candidate minimal topology with 4 nodes (fixed supports and load node plus one top node).",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_5 to reduce height and members. Use nodes 1, 2, 3, 4. Connect 1-3, 2-3, 1-4, 2-4, 3-4 forming a triangular truss. Assign member areas to satisfy stress while minimizing mass: smaller sections for less stressed members, larger for highest stress only if necessary.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Reducing span and number of members reduces mass. Triangle 1-2-4 is base, node 3 at mid base as applied load. Using node_4 elevated to absorb load into truss efficiently. Assign area ids based on calculated member lengths and estimated forces. Longer members benefit from lighter sections unless high force applies. Target area ids mostly 1-3 level keeping mass low. Members in tension get smaller area, compression members larger if critical.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: m1(1-3)=2.0m, m2(2-3)=4.0m, m3(1-4)=3.0m, m4(2-4)=4.24m, m5(3-4)=3.0m. Max tension roughly 10 (applied load) → max allowable stress 20, so sectional areas minimum ~0.5. Use areas from set: prefer 1(0.195),2(0.782),3(1.759). Total mass estimation = sum(length × area).
