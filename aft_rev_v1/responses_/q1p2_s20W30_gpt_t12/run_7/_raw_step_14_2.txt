High mass mainly from large member areas and some long members. Members at area_id \'3\' and connections around node_4 and node_5 use large material. Complexity high with node_6 adding mass without reducing stress critically. Current nodes mostly fixed due to loads and supports constraints except node_4, node_5, node_6.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing member areas on heavy members and simplify member layout for mass reduction; possibly remove node_6 to reduce complexity and mass; reposition node_4 upwards to form a more triangular stable geometry; keep node_5 for load path, reduce members connected to node_5; lower area IDs to reduce mass while maintaining constraints; members with zero or minimal stress can be reduced in area or removed.",\n  "proposal": "Remove node_6 and related members; adjust node_4 position higher to ~4.1; reduce node_5 vertically and place at (4.3, 2.5); sharpen triangulation to distribute stresses; members from node_1, node_2, node_3 to node_4 and node_5 well connected; area assignments mostly 2 (0.782) and 1 (0.195) except in primary load path with area 3 (1.759) for stronger members where needed to keep stresses low.",\n  "reasoning": "Removing node_6 reduces weight and complexity. Line supports and loads kept fixed. Node_4 raising gives better moment arm for transfer to supports. Triangular bracing between nodes improves load path. Decreasing large area members to medium or small areas given max stress well below ±20 allows mass savings. Crossing members avoided to reduce redundant length. Member lengths shorter, enhancing both mass and stress capacity.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Expected mass: sum(member_length * area) should be under 30.
