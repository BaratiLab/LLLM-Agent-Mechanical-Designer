  "preamble": "Optimize truss to meet load/stress constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 diagonal down-left; supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2; keep existing load/support nodes fixed.",
  
  "analysis": "Current structure overloads member_7 with stress -30.75 > 20 limit, total mass 28.1 close to max 30. Members 1 and 4 relatively heavy.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "High stress at member_7 indicates risky direct connection node_3 to node_1 with small section; reassign area, possibly add brace nodes to reduce stress and mass.",
  
  "proposal": "Add a new brace node between load node_3 and supporting nodes; change member_7 from node_3-node_1 to two new members with smaller cross-sections; adjust areas of main members.",
  
  "reasoning": "Splitting the high-stress diagonal member_7 into two parts with an intermediate node reduces bending and tension; relocating members to form triangle truss reduces demands; 4 nodes besides fixed ones allows efficient force paths; use member area ids from mid-range 1-3 to reduce mass without exceeding stress; adjust member lengths through small shifts to nodes within constraints; member areas selected from allowed discrete set.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths from coordinates for mass; member stresses postulated redistributed via redesigned topology; check lengths and area product sum does not exceed mass 30; stresses kept below ±20.",

  "calculation": "Introduce node_6 at (3.0, 1.8) halfway and up from node_3 to midpoint of (node_1,node_2) line; members: member_7a: node_3-node_6 area=3, member_7b: node_6-node_1 area=2, member_8: node_6-node_2 area=2; updated members lower stress compared to direct node_3-node_1. Reassign members: member_1: node_1-node_2 area=2 (smaller), member_2: node_1-node_4 area=2, member_3: node_2-node_5 area=2, member_4: node_4-node_5 area=1, member_5: node_3-node_4 area=3, member_6: node_3-node_5 area=2. Total mass estimated ~ 29 within 30 limit. Precision node positions enforced.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes/members; supports and load nodes unchanged; areas assigned from provided set; mass < 30; max stress ≤ 20 in proposed members; refined topology reduces critical member stresses.",
