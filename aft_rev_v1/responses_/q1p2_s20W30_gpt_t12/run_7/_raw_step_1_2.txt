Member areas mostly \'2\' with fairly high mass. Node_4 at (2,3) with members forming a suboptimal bracing system. The key stress violation is on member_1 (-52.38 MPa) while member_2 is safe (-16 MPa). Total mass 10.25 < 30 is acceptable but can be optimized to reallocate area for stronger location.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increase area near high compression members or reroute forces via stronger members. Alternative is adding new node vertically between node_3 and node_4 or slightly relocating node_4 upwards or outwards to better triangulate force path. Area selected from sets; use higher area on most stressed members. Geometry modification needed to redirect force efficiently.",\n  "proposal": "Add new node at (2.0, 4.5) above node_4 to create double triangular bracing and add members from node_1 and node_2 to new node, upgrading heavy compression member area to at least \'5\' (4.887) or \'6\'. Increase member_1 area from \'1\' to \'5\'. Retain members interconnecting nodes 3, 4, and new node. Remove problematic member_3 (node_1-node_4) or reduce its loading by geometry.",\n  "reasoning": "Adding new node higher increases triangulation, reduces compression on primary members by creating a stiffer arch. Upgrading cross section on member_1 to reduce stress per load given stress ~Force/area. Removing low efficiency members and redistributing loads smartly can lower max stress under threshold. Geometry keeps supports fixed; new node just shifts load path. Mass will remain within limit as added members use moderate areas but the reduction on problematic member_3 area\'s could balance mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calc: e.g. member_1 (node_1 to node_3) length ~2m, now area increased to 4.887, load ~-52.38 * units => Stress limit is ±20 so new ability should drop stress by factor >2.5. Adding node at (2,4.5) creates new lengths: node_4 to new_node distance ~1.5m vertical, node_1 to new_node ~ sqrt(2^2 + 4.5^2)=4.85m, members connected with moderate length and area optimize force path. Distributing compression among multiple members lowers member-wise max stress. Estimated mass increase acceptable under 30 limit.",\n  "calculation": "Assign member_1 area_id \'5\' (4.887), member_2 and others keep as \'2\' except their length recalculated. Added members (node_1 to new_node) and (node_2 to new_node) with area \'3\' (1.759). Remove member_3. Recalculate total mass ~ sum(length×area) ~ below 30. Max stress reduced by increasing area and new node addition.
