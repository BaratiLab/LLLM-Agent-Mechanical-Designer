Constraints require reduced max stress and total mass below 30.

Total mass is acceptable. Members around node_3 and node_4 carry heavy load from diagonal force. Member_6 carries excessive load with small cross-section (area_id 1=0.195), causing stress limit violation. Improving load path and enhancing some members\' sections may solve most constraints. Existing nodes for loading atom positions cannot move. Current nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2.2,3.8), node_5(4.5,2.8). Positions approximate a trapezoidal truss, but member connectivity lacks redundant bracing at top chord and diagonals near node_4.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing area on member_6 reduces stress but increases mass. Adding or relocating node between node_3-node_4 or near node_4-node_5 might improve force distribution. Ensure not to worsen stress on neighboring members. Avoid increasing mass beyond 30. Reduce length or redesign member with tension and compression optimized via connectivity changes. Avoid long slender members under high stress.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Modify current design by: \\n- Adding node_6 near node_4 between node_4 and node_5 for better force distribution.\\n- Increase area of member_6 from \'1\' (0.195) to \'3\' (1.759) for stress relief.\\n- Add member from node_6 to node_3 and node_6 to node_5 with area_id \'2\' (0.782).\\n- Adjust node_4 coordinates slightly upward to (2.2, 4.0) to increase truss height and reduce bending moments.\\n- Keep all support and load nodes unchanged.\\n- Remove member_7 (node_3 - node_2, area 1) to avoid redundancies and balance forces.\\nNew node position node_6 at (3.5,3.3) optimizes force path between node_4 and node_5.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing height reduces force in critical compression and tension members by increasing moment arm. Higher area on member_6 means can carry more load without stress violations. Adding node_6 and members 6-3, 6-5 splits load and reduces stress concentration, improving stability and redistribution of forces at top chord nodes. This classic approach stabilizes truss under diagonal loading. Member removal \'member_7\' prevents stress accumulation in small area members.
