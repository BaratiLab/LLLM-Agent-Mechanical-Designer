Max allowed stress ±20, max total mass 30. Previous design at iteration 9 has stress up to 56.4 and mass 30.17, failing constraints. Improvements needed in load path and sizing.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The previous design violates max stress mainly in member_4 (node_4 to node_5), at 56.4 which greatly exceeds ±20 limit. The total mass is just over max limit at 30.17. Members immediate to load node_3, especially those in tension/compression transfer, have stress beyond limits. Indirect members closer to supports have lower stress. Current layout has 6 nodes including internal node_6 at (3.0,1.8) in between bottom chord members, hypothesized to increase stiffness but caused stress concentration in some members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, remove problematic internal node_6 or reposition it to optimize force flow. Simplify tensegrity load path: focus force path from load node_3 to supports via lower effective internal bracing and upper chord more efficient. Reduce oversized areas except where essential. Use nodes to form a more triangulated, stable structure directing load into supports.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_6. Keep existing supports node_1 and node_2, and the loaded node_3 fixed. Move node_4 and node_5 optimized to generate robust triangulated frame: node_4 near (2.4,6.0), node_5 near (4.8,3.6). Connect members as: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_2-node_5, node_4-node_5, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_5 and node_1-node_4. Select member areas match member forces, prioritize lower areas where stresses are low for mass savings. Adjust members between nodes 3,4,5 to create a triangular truss to distribute load and reduce peak stresses.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "To decrease maximum stress, avoid direct heavy loading on many members and create simple, clear force paths with triangular geometry. Elevating node_4 allows tension members from node_3-point load upward, and node_5 placement closes triangulation efficiently, transferring load to node_2 supporting the roller. Larger cross-sections only used on compressive members and longer tension members directly loaded. Removing node_6 simplifies internal force transfer and eliminates stress concentrations from complex paths.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate approximate member lengths and assign appropriate cross section IDs iteratively for stress under 20.

Assign areas smaller for shorter members (1-2 areas) and larger for longer/more stressed fibers. Calculate mass accordingly sum(length*area).
