  "preamble": "Optimize closed 2D truss with 3 fixed nodes, given load at node_3; constraints max stress ±20, max mass ≤30.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes fixed: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Load at node_3 downward-left. Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Max stress ±20, max mass ≤30. Need a closed truss (cycle) connecting nodes to resist load and ensure stiffness.",

  "analysis": "Given three nodes roughly on same horizontal line, closed truss needs at least one additional node above to form a triangle to carry vertical/horizontal components and reduce bending. Loads applied diagonally down-left at node_3. Max stress ±20 limits required area on members subject to tension/compression. Mass limited: sum of length × area ≤30. Need minimal members yet stable triangulated shape.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Add 1 node (node_4) above line near node_3 around (2,3.0) to form triangle node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_2-node_3-node_4. Use members: 1-3, 2-3, 1-4, 2-4, 3-4. This creates 2 triangles closing around node_3. By distributing forces through these, stress is manageable and mass constrained. Use areas from set to balance strength vs mass.",

  "reasoning": "Triangulation is primary strategy: create triangle above line using node_4. Members connecting supports (node_1 and node_2), and load node_3 to node_4 create roughly two triangles. Load at node_3 can be resolved through two paths to supports. Areas assigned by approximate force distribution estimated through static equilibrium. Use member forces and length to estimate stress (force/area) and masses (length × area). Aim for areas large enough to keep stress ≤20 and mass ≤30 total.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear axial members, area chosen from given discrete set. Simplify load resolution by splitting load at node_3 equally to paths 3-1- and 3-2-. Forces in members roughly P/2 = 5 units for major members tension/compression. Calculate length by Euclidean distance. Neglect moments because triangulated, assume axial forces only.",

  "calculation": "Nodes positions: N1(0,0), N2(6,0), N3(2,0), N4(2,3.0). Member lengths: 1-3=2m, 2-3=4m, 1-4=√(2² + 3²)=~3.6056m, 2-4=√(4² + 3²)=5.0m, 3-4=3m. Approximate forces: M3-4 carries 10 units load tension +/- 45°, so axial force about 7 units along member; members 1-4 and 2-4 carry near half load each (~5 units).\nSelect area IDs:\n- member 3-4: needed strength = force/stress_limit = 7/20=0.35 → area_id '1' (0.195) too small, use area_id '2' (0.782)\n- members 1-4 & 2-4: force ~5 units, area needed = 5/20=0.25 → area_id '1' (0.195) a bit small but can accept slight margin or use area_id '2'\n- member 1-3 and 2-3 carry less force, area_id '1' (0.195) sufficient\nMass estimate:\nLength × area sum = (1-3:2×0.195)+(2-3:4×0.195)+(1-4:3.6056×0.782)+(2-4:5×0.782)+(3-4:3×0.782)\n=0.39+0.78+2.819+3.91+2.346=10.25 << 30 limit, good\nStress approx less than max 20.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Close check: closed truss all nodes connected, no duplicates, stress and mass within limits by conservative area selection, no node relocated, meets all criteria.",
