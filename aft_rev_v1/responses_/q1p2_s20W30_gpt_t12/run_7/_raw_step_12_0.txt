Load is at node_3 downward-left, supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 fixed. Existing nodes for load/support fixed. Areas chosen roughly moderate to larger introduced in last iteration. Current max stress is 28.51; need to reduce by better member arrangement and sizing.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current design concentrates stress at member_6 (node_1 to node_4) and member_1 (node_1 to node_3). Taller node_4 at (2.5,4.0) exerts longer length members that carry heavy tensile load needing larger area. Mass OK. Structure could benefit from eliminating redundant long slender members and better triangulation. Node_6 (added 3.5,2.0) helps load path but member areas are unbalanced causing overload on some members.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Main load at node_3 offsets toward supports 1 & 2. Reinforce members connected directly from node_3 to supports and intermediate nodes to distribute stress evenly. Reduce largest tensile member areas, move node_4 slightly to optimize force angles, remove node_6 for simplification and delete overlapped low stressed members. Try three-node triangulation for cable-effect to reduce stress in critical members.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Remove node_6 to reduce complexity. Move node_4 to 2.2, 3.8 to shorten and reduce tensile stress in member_6. Keep node_5 at 4.5, 2.8 to support lateral force appropriately.

Slight node_4 move reduces moment arm and load in member_6, reassigning area to lower cross-section for under-stressed members reduces mass. Adding member_7 (node_3-node_2) helps bypass load directly, reducing max stressed member loads shared at node_1. Cross-sectional areas chosen upright to maintain stresses below ±20.
