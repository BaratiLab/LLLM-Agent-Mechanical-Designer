Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Keep these nodes fixed. Constraints: max stress ±20, max total mass <=30. Current max stress is 27.42 > 20, mass 29.4 near limit. Need to reduce max stress below 20 while keeping mass under 30.",\n  "analysis": "Current design has stress violations mainly in members with smallest area (area_id=1) adjacent to node_4 and node_1 (member_6: 27.41). Member_5 under high compression(-17.7 near -20) with smallest area. Increasing member areas is limited by mass constraint. Members near load and support need stiffening; improve load paths by node repositioning and selective area changes. Nodes 4,5,6 can be repositioned or removed to simplify and improve load distribution. Member_6 with highest stress uses smallest area, increasing area to 2 or 3 might reduce stress. Use nodal repositioning to improve force flow and reduce bending.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce member number by removing node_6 to save mass and reoptimize. Shift node_4 slightly upward and closer horizontally to node_3 for better triangulation. Keep node_5 position near load to support force transfer. Increase areas strategically and keep long members light to reduce mass. Add diagonal members to reduce bending on nodes 4 and 5.",\n  "proposal": "New structure with nodes: node_1: (0.0,0.0), node_2: (6.0,0.0), node_3: (2.0,0.0), node_4: (2.2,4.2), node_5: (4.0,2.7). Members: member_1(node_1-node_3, area 2), member_2(node_3-node_4, area 3), member_3(node_4-node_5, area 2), member_4(node_5-node_2, area 2), member_5(node_3-node_5, area 3), member_6(node_1-node_4, area 1), member_7(node_4-node_2, area 1). Removed node_6 and members involving it to reduce unnecessary mass and stress concentration.",\n  "reasoning": "Removing node_6 simplifies structure and saves mass. Increasing area of critical diagonal member_5 to area 3 reduces stress contraction and tensile peaks. Node_4 lifted slightly expands triangular geometry optimizing joint efficiency and force paths. Member_7 with small area connects node_4 to node_2 for stabilization with low mass. Using area increments on diagonals adapts axial forces handling. This truss is statically determinate with effective load paths into pinned and roller supports. Overall mass below 30 and expected max stress under ±20 from area + geometry improvements.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: member_1 L=sqrt((2-0)^2+0)=2, mass approx 2*0.782=1.564< prev 1.564 ok. member_2 L=sqrt((2.2-2)^2+(4.2-0)^2)=sqrt(0.04+17.64)=4.20, mass=4.2*1.759=7.38 High but critical area needed. member_5 L= sqrt((4-2)^2+(2.7-0)^2)= sqrt(4+7.29)=3.56, mass=3.56*1.759=6.27, increased area better. member_6 and 7 are small and near supports.
