Current max stress ~26 and mass ~57 - too high. Load on node_3, supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Members and areas need resizing/re-selecting and geometry refinement. Existing top node locations adjustable (except supports/load nodes).",\n\n    "analysis": "The current design excesses mass due to oversized member_2 (area 5) and overall member area choices. max stress in member_7 (area 1) also violates limit => increasing area significantly increases mass. Adding new nodes should redistribute force and reduce load on high-stress members. Geometry with node_4 at (2.4, 6.0) places big large vertical member_2 increasing area. The current topology lacks sufficient triangulation to distribute loads effectively. Member_7 tension too high and too thin. We must reduce member area 5→3 or less, improve triangulation and reduce member span or lengths.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on moving node_4 down closer to loading node_3 to reduce member lengths. Possibly add one intermediate node above line node_3-node_5 within triangle between support nodes ensuring load path. Properly size member areas: lower for small members, larger for high load members under 20 stress constraint. Try member area set {1,2,3,4} mostly to control mass under 30. Also reconsider member connections to remove member_7 spanning node_1-node_4 producing excessive tension.",\n\n    "proposal": "Revised nodes: retain supports node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), load node_3(2,0). Move node_4 lower: (2.5, 4.0). Move node_5 near (4.5, 2.8) to reduce verticality and length of members. Introduce new node_6(3.5,2.0) to improve triangulation and reduce load. Connections: members connect node_1 to node_3 (area 2), node_3 to node_4 (area 3), node_4 to node_5 (area 2), node_5 to node_2 (area 3), node_3 to node_5 (area 2), node_1 to node_4 (area 1), node_4 to node_6 (area 2), node_6 to node_5 (area 1), node_6 to node_2 (area 1). This allows better load distribution with lower max stress and total mass below 30.",\n\n    "reasoning": "By lowering node_4, we shorten very long vertical members and reduce forces. The newly added node_6 in the middle triangulates the upper panel reducing bending stresses. Reassigning member areas mostly 1-3 trims mass while respecting stress. The exclusion of large area 5 in member_2 eliminates large mass contributor. Member_7 from node_1 to node_4 area =1 to keep small tension member. Multiple shorter members handle the load instead of fewer large members. This should reduce maximum stress below 20 and mass below 30. Load at node_3 with 45° force offset handled via angled members to nodes above and aside.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: (node_1-node_3) = 2, (node_3-node_4) approx sqrt((2.5-2)^2 + (4-0)^2)=4.03, (node_4-node_5)= sqrt((4.5-2.5)^2 + (2.8-4)^2) = 2.49, (node_5-node_2) = sqrt((6-4.5)^2+(0-2.8)^2)=3.15, (node_3-node_5) = sqrt((4.5-2)^2 + (2.8-0)^2)=3.5, (node_1-node_4) = sqrt(2.5^2+4^2)=4.72, (node_4-node_6)= sqrt((3.5-2.5)^2+(2-4)^2)=2.24,(node_6-node_5)=sqrt((4.5-3.5)^2+(2.8-2)^2)=1.34,(node_6-node_2)=sqrt((6-3.5)^2+(0-2)^2)=3.0. Then mass sum = sum(Length * Area_partial), target less than 30. Max member stress halved by triangulation and area reduction. Geometry balanced to reduce moments on pinned and roller supports.",\n\n    "calculation": "Mass: member_1:2.0*0.782=1.56, member_2:4.03*1.759=7.09, member_3:2.49*0.782=1.95, member_4:3.15*1.759=5.54, member_5:3.5*0.782=2.74, member_6:4.71*0.195=0.92, member_7:2.24*0.782=1.75, member_8:1.34*0.195=0.26, member_9:3.0*0.195=0.58, total~22.39 < 30, stresses expected < 20 due to improved triangular topology and areas.
