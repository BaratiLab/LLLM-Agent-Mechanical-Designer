Current iteration 23 has max stress 10.29 (OK), but mass 32.7401 (exceeds max). Load at node 3: -10 N at -45°. Supports pinned and roller at nodes 1,2. Existing structure is complex with 7 nodes and 10 members. We must reduce mass without increasing stress beyond limit.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current cellular web of members achieves low max stress well below limit, but mass is above max by ~2.7. Key heavy members are those with area 3 and 4 near 3.5 vertical height nodes. Possibly trimming area sizes and optimally repositioning intermediate node_7 might reduce mass. Last design added node_7 at (2.6,1.5) with robust members. Maybe reposition node_7 between nodes 3,4,5 closer to loading line to shorten members and reduce cross sections. Member forces are quite low, suggesting oversized members. Pick smaller areas where stress magnitude is far below 20, especially members with ~0 to 3. Member_4 with area 4 is massive (mass 9.3892). Lower area if safe.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Auto-selection of member areas reduces by default with stress. Focus on reducing areas for members with low forces and shortening bars by adjusting node_7 and node_6 to optimize. Consider redirecting load path with a more triangular shape to minimize efficient structural mass with tension and compression balanced.",\n\n  "proposal": "Maintain nodes 1,2,3 (support and load fixed). Move node_4 closer to load line, new pos around (3.0,1.8). Move node_5 to (4.0,1.3). Slightly lower node_6 near (3.4,0.5). Shift node_7 to (2.8,1.0). Remove some intermediate members or reduce areas sensibly for light-loading members. Use area_ids 2 for main members, and shift 4 to fewer members only if stressed near limits. Structure connectivity adjusted to preserve load transfer: members connecting nodes 1-3, 3-7, 7-6, 7-5, 5-2, 4-2, 3-4, 4-5, 6-5 with reduced areas mostly 2 and 1 where safe.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "By lowering some top nodes and re-positioning node_7 toward load line to reduce member lengths and unneeded cross-section area, the total mass reduces. Smaller area choice on lightly stressed member reduces mass without exceeding ±20 stress. The slightly more compact upper part reduces lever-arm moments and overall stress intensity with comparable member lengths, lowering load in low stressed members. Concentrating the structure reduces internal stress but principally reduces areas used, and mass sum length*area <=30 can be achieved while keeping max stress <=20.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths from node coordinates, multiply by corpus cross sectional area mass factors. Short members and selecting 1 or 2 areas on lightly loaded members reduce weight drastically. Maintain larger areas on heavily loaded members between nodes 3-7-1 load path. Remove oversize areas (4) replaced by smaller areas (1 or 2).",\n\n  "calculation": "Node length estimates: Example length node_7(2.8,1.0) to node_1(0,0) ≈ 3.0; node_7 to node_3 (2,0) ≈1.05; Choosing member_4 area 2 instead of 4 saves mass. Total summed mass should be below 30. Stress estimation from previous below 10 for low members also applies with lowering cross sections. Five main members with area 2 or less have acceptable stresses.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Final check: max compressive/tensile stresses estimated under ±20, mass estimate from sum length * area mass factors under 30 saved by new member length shortening and area reduction.
