Structure must be closed and all nodes connected. Max stress ±20, max mass 30. Member areas from given set. Node positions fixed except new nodes allowed for closed structure.",\n  "analysis": "Single loaded node (node_3) on line between supports. Existing triangle formed by node_1-2-3 is degenerate (colinear). To ensure a closed truss that resists load, add a higher node above baseline to form a triangular stable structure to distribute stress and reduce length of compression/tension. Optimal choice is to place an additional node vertically above node_3 for a simple, minimal extra length. Members are from supports and the new node connecting nodes 1, 2, 3 and new node form closed triangle plus chords for stability.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding one node above node_3 elevation y > 0 to form triangle (non-colinear). Use members: node_1-new, node_2-new, node_3-new, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3 (forming closed polygon). Select cross sections following max stress and mass limitation.",\n  "reasoning": "Layouts favor triangle of nodes (node_1, node_2, new_node) with node_3 connected inside. Load direction -10N at -45°, roughly downward-left. Truss must transfer load at node_3 through new node and supports without any member exceeding ±20 stress or total mass exceeding 30. Use axial force equilibrium. Approximate forces and length to estimate required cross-sectional area and check mass sum.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic truss members only carry axial forces calculated by static equilibrium. Gravity, member self-weight neglected in load. Stress = Force/Area. Member mass approximated as length×area (mass units consistent with max mass units). Areas from discrete given set. Areas selected to keep stress ≤20. Minimal node vertical offset ~2 chosen to minimize lengths and mass, assures non-colinearity.",\n  "calculation": "Define new node_4 at (2.0,2.0) above node_3 to form upward triangle: Nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2,2). Members: m1(node_1-node_3), m2(node_3-node_4), m3(node_4-node_2), m4(node_4-node_1), m5(node_3-node_2). Member lengths approx: m1=2.0, m2=2.0, m3=~4.472; m4=~2.828; m5=4.0. Static equilibrium with applied force -10 N at node_3 downward-left at 45°. Distribute forces on members near node_3 and node_4 assuming tension in m2 and compression in m4. Estimate forces: worst member force ≈ 20 N (max allowed). Determine required area for stress ≤ 20 => Area ≥ Force/Stress = 20/20=1. Use area_id=\'1\' (0.195), \'0\'(1) etc. Select minimal areas satisfying stress limits for efficiency. Sum mass approx as sum(length*area) ≤ 30. Calculated mass ≈ 2*0.195 + 2*1 + 4.472*0.782 + 2.828*0.782 + 4*0.195 = ~0.39+2+3.5+2.2+0.78=~8.9 < 30.
