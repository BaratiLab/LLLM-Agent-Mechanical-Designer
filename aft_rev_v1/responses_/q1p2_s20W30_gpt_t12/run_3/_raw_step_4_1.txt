Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Existing max stress 324 > 20, mass 19.37 < 30 but force distribution very uneven causing peak stress. Need better load path and lower stress concentration.",\n\n  "analysis": "Large compressive stress primarily in member_3 (node_5-node_4) at -324, tensile/compressive stresses exceed limits. Mass within limit but poor stress sharing. Structure over-stressed possibly due to awkward geometry and inappropriate cross-sectional areas. Too many small area members in high stress zones.", \n  "scratch_pad_2":"Need stiffer paths near load node_3 and reduce force in critical members by adjusting topology. Possibly relocate or add nodes above node_3 to create alternate load path. Avoid member_3 type long single members in compression. Increase high stress members\' area and redesign layout to balance forces.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add 1 node above node_3 to introduce double load path and triangles. New node_7 at (2.8,3.2). Modify members as: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_7, node_7-node_5, node_7-node_4, node_5-node_4, node_5-node_2, node_4-node_2, node_4-node_1, node_3-node_6, node_6-node_2 with revised areas to cap stress ≤20 and mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Introducing node_7 forms stiffer triangular bracing decomposing load from node_3 through node_7 to top nodes, reducing compression in previous critical member (node_5-node_4). Areas chosen to keep stress below 20 limit providing higher areas on high compression/tension members and small areas in less stressed members to control mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths, assign areas from set {0:1,1:0.195,2:0.782,3:1.759,4:3.128,...}.

Iterate sizing between area ids 2-4 for mid-range stresses, around area id 1 for minor force members.",\n\n  "calculation": "Member lengths and rough mass calculations: example node_3-node_7 length ~ (2.8-2,3.2-0) = sqrt(0.8²+3.2²)= approx 3.29.
