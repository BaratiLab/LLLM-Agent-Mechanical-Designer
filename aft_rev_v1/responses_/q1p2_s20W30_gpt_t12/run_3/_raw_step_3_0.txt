Current max stress 27.03 (member_5), mass 41.26; heavy members with large areas cause mass excess and stress violation.",\n\n    "analysis": "Existing structure has multiple intermediate nodes and large-area members (area_ids 3 and 4). Max stress in member_5 (area_id 1) too high and mass dominated by members with area 3 and 4. Supports fixed; load at node_3 downward to left (-10, -45°). Current layout\'s triangular formations cause stress concentration and mass overrun.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce member sizes and complexity. Simplify truss geometry to reduce heavy members. Reposition added nodes for efficiency but keep load/support nodes fixed.",\n\n    "proposal": "Propose 2 intermediate nodes better placed for efficient load transfer and stable triangular sub-structures. Use smaller cross sections to reduce mass while meeting stress limits. Adapt node_5 and node_6 for better load flow.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Reducing node_5 y-position and node_6 x & y can make less elongated members, cutting member length and mass. Using lower area_ids on tension members under 20 stress. Redistribute stresses by optimal triangulation. Remove redundant large-area members, increase area for members under high compressive stress but cap at area 2 or below to limit mass. Member connections to maintain stability and resist load adequately.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths, assign area_ids to keep stresses <±20 and mass <30. Members with tension/compression below ±10 m.u. can be area_id 1 or 2 to save mass. Members near max allowable should be area_id 3 max for safety margin.",\n\n    "calculation": "Member lengths approx: \\n - node_1 to node_3: 2.0\\n - node_3 to node_5: ~1.8\\n - node_5 to node_4: ~1.1\\n - node_5 to node_2: ~4.2\\n - node_4 to node_2: ~4.5\\n - node_4 to node_1: ~2.8\\n - node_3 to node_2: 4.0\\n - node_3 to node_6: ~3.3\\n - node_6 to node_2: ~2.5\\n\\n Choose areas: \\n  - Increase members under high stress up to area_id 3,\\n  - others reduce to area_id 1 or 0,\\n  - keep total mass estimate ≤30.\\n\\nTotal estimated mass ~ sum(length*area) ≈ 26-29 within constraint.",\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Rechecked no duplicate nodes or members.
