  "preamble": "Optimized 2D truss for load at node_3 with support at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller).",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load is -10 N at 45° downward-left at node_3. Support nodes fixed. Current max stress 47.7 > ±20 limit; mass 14.64 < max 30. Optimization goal: reduce max stress by improving force path and cross-section sizing, possibly adding/repositioning internal nodes for better stress distribution.",
  
  "analysis": "The current truss shows overstress especially in member_5 (node_4-node_1) at 47.67 which violates the stress constraint. The loading creates tension/compression paths that are not efficiently resolved by the member layout and sizes. Mass is low but strong members (area 3 or above) make force path uneven. Some tension members are underused enabling mass reallocation. Node 6 location can be better placed closer to force direction to reduce length and stress concentration. The internal node pattern can be improved for force triangulation and geometry.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider relocating node_6 closer to node_3 but elevated off baseline for better triangulation. Add one new internal node near center above load point to balance top chords. Reassign areas of cross sections to avoid overstressed member_5. Use combinations of smaller areas in tension members and marginally larger ones in compression. Use minimum number of members to triangulate the overall structure for stiffness and force path redistribution.",
  
  "proposal": "Maintain supports and load node fixing positions. Keep node_3 at (2,0), node_1 at (0,0), node_2 at (6,0). Introduce one new node node_7 at (3.2,2.5) above node_3 near the center for force distribution. Move former node_6 to (3.7,1.7) as node_6 to improve geometry. Build members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_7, node_7-node_2, node_7-node_6, node_6-node_2, node_6-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_5-node_4, node_4-node_1, node_3-node_6, node_4-node_7. Assign cross-sectional area ids respecting max stress ≤20 — use smaller areas for less stressed members and moderate for critical compression or tension members. Target mass ≤30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Adding node_7 above center improves triangulation and load transfer to supports. Moving node_6 higher and toward node_2 balances force paths and member lengths, reducing stress peaks. Moving node_5 slightly upwards (at 4.8,2.1) maintains stable geometry. Fewer very large area members reduces excess mass and limits buckling risk. Selecting areas to balance stress avoids local overstress observed previously in 'member_5'. The new geometry creates better force flow and reduces lengths of critical compression/tension members, improving buckling and stress capacity. The triangulated layout avoids unstable or destabilizing long chords.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths from nodal coords. Estimate forces and target stress ≤20 by adjusting cross-section areas sequentially. Compress lightly loaded members to small area (id 1 or 0.195), critical tension/compression members with moderate areas (2 or 3). Sum mass from member lengths multiplied by area mass factors to keep total <30. Verify no member exceeds stress limits both compression and tension. Iterate sizing subject to geometry fixity except minor nodal relocations (only for internal nodes). Minimal set of members covering full load path and maintaining triangulated geometry.",
  
  "calculation": "Node positions: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2.9,2.3), node_5(4.8,2.1), node_6(3.7,1.7), node_7(3.2,2.5).\nMember length examples: \n- member_1 (node_1-node_3): length 2.0 m\n- member_2 (node_3-node_7): sqrt((3.2-2)^2 + (2.5-0)^2) ≈ 2.66 m\n- member_3 (node_7-node_2): sqrt((6-3.2)^2 + 0^2 + (0-2.5)^2) ~ sqrt(7.84 + 6.25) = sqrt(14.09) ≈ 3.75 m\n\nUse areas {member: area_id}: assign areas\n- highly loaded in compression or tension: area 3 or 4\n- moderately stressed members: area 2\n- lightly stressed: area 1 or 0.195\nCalculate total mass by sum(length × area_factor), ensuring below 30.\nValidate max stresses approaches <20 per constraint.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no over-stressed members. No duplicate nodes or members. Supports and loaded nodes positions unchanged. Order member ids from member_1 sequentially. Clear connective pattern ensuring triangulated stable topology. Anticipate coordinated geometry supporting load at node_3 directed downward-left. Protect pinned and roller differential supports.",
