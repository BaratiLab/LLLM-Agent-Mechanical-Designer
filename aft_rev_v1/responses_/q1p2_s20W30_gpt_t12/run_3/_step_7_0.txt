  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss for load and support with max stress ±20 and mass ≤30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given load on node_3, pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Present structure just exceeds stress limit (-23.6 vs ±20 allowed). Mass 26.8<30 - feasible. Need stress reduction by geometry adjustment and/or area change. Mass budget allows minor increase.",
  
  "analysis": "Current max stress at member_5 (-23.6) exceeding compressive limit. Members 9,10 carry zero stress (opportunistic removal or reduction?). Members 4 at 19.96 near upper bound tensile limit. Structure uses 7 nodes, 10 members with mixed areas 1 to 3. Load on node_3 (-10N @ -45°, so compression tension distribution nonuniform). Key stress reduction in compressive member_5 needed. Member_5 short, area 1 smallest (0.195) barely held at this stress. Could relocate node_5 upward for better load path, reduce stress on member_5. Remove members with zero stress for mass saving, possibly increase areas selectively on high stress members. No shifting supports or loads allowed. Possibility to add one extra node higher to improve force distribution. Member redundancy reduced to declutter structure.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress -23.6 just 18% over limit, geometry tweak to raise node_5 and connect differently may reduce compressive forces. Reduce zero force members or assign smaller cross-section. Also reassign highest stressed members to a larger area index to increase capacity while controlling mass.",
  
  "proposal": "Add node_8 at (2.2, 3.7) above current node_5 and node_7. Remove members member_9 and member_10 with zero stress. Modify connectivity to create direct load path: connect node_3-node_8, node_8-node_5, node_8-node_7; remove node_6. Increase critical compressive members area to 3 or 4. Remove low-effect members to reduce mass. Members in tension near limit area 3 sufficiently strong. Fine tune member_5 area larger 2 (0.782).",
  
  "reasoning": "Raising node_8 above node_5 delivers better load redistribution, reduces compression on member_5 analog (now member between node_5 and node_8) by redirecting forces. Removing zero-stress members lowers mass. Increased area strategically on compression member improves stress capacity. Direct connections simplify force path and balance tensile/compressive stress within ±20. Mass estimate remains <30 given removed members offset minor area increase. Design maintains support/loading positions unchanged. No geometry collision or member duplication identified.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Mass calculation approximated by member length * area: old mass 26.8. Removed member_9 and member_10 (~10 mass unit total), add members (~5 units). Area changes balanced to keep total ~28. Max stress re-checked to <20 with area and geometry changes.",
