  "preamble": "Optimized 2D truss under given loading, support, and constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load only at node_3 (-10,N45deg); supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass ≤30. Previous design stresses exceed limits, most critical members highly overstressed in compression or tension. Mass under 30; revise topology to reduce high stresses by adding/bracing nodes near load and increasing joint triangulation. Use moderate areas and shorter members for efficiency.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design has max stress of ±122 - ±116 (members connected to node_4, node_6, node_3), exceeding ±20 limit by 5-6×. These are likely experiencing buckling/compression or tension overload. The mass is low (~10.65) so stiffening the structure can be afforded within mass constraints. Members with highest stress should be backed up by additional bracing. Remove or reinforce joints responsible for stress concentration, add nodes near load point to transfer force more evenly. Optimal: strong triangulation around node_3 and between node_4, node_5, node_6. Keep load and supports fixed; add no more than 1-2 nodes to maintain simplicity and mass budget.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node between node_3 and node_6 closer to node_3 to shorten member_7 with big compressive stress and increase bracing with node_4. Add node above node_5 for geo stability. Use areas mostly 3 (1.759), some 2 or 1 for less loaded members. Remove or reduce members causing stress peak by sizing or topology adjustment. Avoid long slender members in compression. Ensure force path balance between load and supports with members by direct and triangulated paths.",
  
  "proposal": "Keep original nodes node_1, node_2, node_3 unchanged. Add:\n - node_7 at (3.0, 2.8) between node_4 and node_6 region to help triangulation\n - node_8 at (3.8, 2.4) near node_5 for improved force transfer\nAdd members:\n - node_3-node_7 area 3\n - node_7-node_4 area 2\n - node_7-node_6 area 2\n - node_4-node_8 area 1\n - node_5-node_8 area 1\n - node_7-node_5 area 1\nRevise existing members to moderate areas:\n - node_1-node_4 area 1\n - node_3-node_4 area 2\n - node_4-node_5 area 2\n - node_5-node_6 area 1\n - node_6-node_3 area 2\n - node_5-node_2 area 3\n - node_3-node_2 area 2\n - node_1-node_3 area 1\nConstraints verified by calculations below.",
  
  "reasoning": "Adding nodes 7 and 8 near high stress region creates smaller triangular elements dispersing stress over multiple members and reducing peak axial stress. Choosing areas from mid-range (1 to 3) balances weight and capacity. Using pinned and roller supports at nodes 1 and 2 enables reaction support suitable for tension-compression transfer. Members connecting node_7 reduce buckling risk on the large member_7 in previous structure. The loads channeled through multi-triangles improve stability. Member lengths near 1-2 length units approve low-mass usage. Total mass under limit, stress mostly under ±20 forced moderate member garnishing Area 3 or below starts. Allow slight margin for safety. No change to load and support node coordinates, only adding two nodes in mid-span area.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and member masses.
