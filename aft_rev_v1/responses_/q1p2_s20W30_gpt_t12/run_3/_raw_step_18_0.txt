Constraints constrain stress and mass. Current model over stress and mass.",\n  "analysis": "Current structure at iteration 17 has max stress 140.46 (exceeding 20) and mass 39.34 (exceeding 30). Large areas on members 9 & 11 (area 4) to reduce stresses caused mass increase. High tensile stress particularly at member_7.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stresses, redistribute forces using better triangulation; reduce large area members causing overshoot in mass; introduce two internal nodes to improve triangulation and force paths with smaller areas allowed.",\n  "proposal": "Fix node_1, node_2, node_3 per instruction. Add 2 new nodes at (3.0, 1.3) and (4.2, 1.7) to enhance triangulation and force path. Remove node_8 and associated longer members that increased stress/mass. Reconfigure members to full triangulated stable truss with smaller areas, limiting usage of areas <= 3. Remove members with extreme stress tendency. Use adequate small-to-medium cross section areas to achieve stress limits under ±20 and stay below 30 mass.",\n  "reasoning": "Triangulated trusses transfer force efficiently lowering stress concentrations. Added internal nodes improve force path. Avoid high area members >3 to control mass. Limit long members subject to bending and high stresses. Maintain support/load nodes fixed.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Members from node_1 to node_3, node_1 to new node_4, node_2 to node_6 and connections among new internal nodes and old nodes create smaller triangles to spread load. Choose areas for tension/compression balancing design criteria. Mass computed as sum(length * area factor), check with area chart.",\n  "calculation": "Calculate lengths of members, assign areas ≤ 3 (0.782 to 3.128), estimate stresses by member forces distributed over new topology.
