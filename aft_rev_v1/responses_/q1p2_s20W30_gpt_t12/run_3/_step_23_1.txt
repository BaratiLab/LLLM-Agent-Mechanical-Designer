    "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss design under given load, supports; satisfy mass and stress limits.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Constraint: max_stress ±20, max_mass 30. Load at node_3, supports at node_1(pinned), node_2(roller). Current max stress exceeds 20 (31.13). Total mass is low (15.11) so room to increase areas selectively. Focus on stress reduction mainly on member_4 (node_3-node_6) and member_8 (node_6-node_1) which show stresses beyond ±20. Allow adding nodes to provide better force paths and shorten highly stressed members. Avoid unstable configurations and redundant members.",
    
    "analysis": "Current design tried minimal seven nodes linked mostly as trapezoid shape plus diagonal braces. High tensile/compressive stress up to ±31 on diagonal members (4, 8) imply force redistribution needed. Since the load at node_3 (-10, -45°) applies demand pulling left-downward, stronger vertical and horizontal supports needed. Node_6 is quite low (3.5, 0.8), which causes long slender members with high stress. Using mid-height node between node_3 and node_6 to split tension path can reduce max stress. Additionally, we should stiffen bottom chord by increasing area or adding shorter members support from node_1 and node_2 to node_3 and node_6 region. The total mass is under limit, so increasing cross sections for members under high stress feasible. Need also to reduce max tensile stress (member_8: 30.47 > 20).",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Add a new node between node_3 and node_6 line near (2.6, 1.5) to create two shorter members, reduce pull in member_4 and 8. Possibly add member from this new node to node_1 or node_5 for force redistribution. Increase all areas mostly on highly stressed members. Remove long diagonals prone to buckling or too low areas. Keep load and support nodes unchanged. Typical area profile start low (0.195) for less stressed, approach 1.759 or 3.128 for critical tension/compression ones.",
    
    "proposal": "Introduce node_7 between node_3 and node_6 approximately at (2.6, 1.5). Update members: node_3 to node_7, node_7 to node_6. Add member node_7 to node_1 and node_7 to node_5. Increase areas of members involving critical tension/compression to at least area_id 3 or 4. Keep rest minimal area 1 or 2. Delete member_4 (node_3 to node_6) since replaced with split paths to node_7. Adjust bottom chord members area if needed.",
    
    "reasoning": "Splitting long tension/compression members into shorter segments reduces stress by shortening effective length and redistributing forces. Diagonal stiffeners to nodes on load path reduce moment arms. Increasing cross-sectional area for members between load/support nodes achieve lower stress reducing strain. Balanced triangulation around load node prevents local overstress. Using added node between node_3 and node_6 located at mid-high vertical optimizes leverage, reduces buckling in diagonal slender members, and satisfies geometric constraints. Total mass growth still maintains allowable limit by selective use of mid-sized profiles. Dowl supporting node_1 via selected members aids pinned support load distribution better.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Distances: node_3(2,0) to node_6(3.5,0.8): ~1.77m. Place node_7 approx (2.6, 1.5) partitions member_4 length ~1.16m and 1.0m segments.
