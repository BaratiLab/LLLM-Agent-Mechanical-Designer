    "preamble": "Redesign truss to meet mass and stress constraints under given load.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Max compressive and tensile stresses ≤ ±20, total mass ≤ 30. Existing max stress of member_4 (55.87), member_3 (36.14), and several others exceed. Current mass 13.63 is well below max, so more structural members with adjusted cross sections can redistribute forces.",
    
    "analysis": "Current structure has several members with high stresses, notably those with area_id 1 (0.195 area) unable to safely carry tensile or compressive load. Members directly connecting loaded node_3 and supports are overstressed, especially diagonal members to node_4 and node_6. Load direction is -10.0 magnitude at -45 deg (down-left). Supports are pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2, so structure must transfer loads effectively between node_3 and these nodes with stable braced components.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "Consider triangulated bracing around node_3 to spread loads, increase cross-section area of critical members from '1' to '2' or '3'. Add additional nodes only if it increases triangulation and reduces member length from critical load nodes. Avoid excessive subdivision causing weight increase. Optimize angled members close to 45° for the load applied. Preserve pinned and roller supports as fixed nodes.",
    
    "proposal": "Add one new node higher near node_5 to stabilize upper triangle, reposition node_6 closer to load and longer diagonal from node_6 to node_2 to better carry tension. Increase critical members' areas. Use strong diagonals from node_3 upwards and across to node_6 and node_2. Keep a triangle with node_1 for lateral stability. Slightly move nodes only by adding node_7 higher near top but keep given load/support nodes intact.",
    
    "reasoning": "Underlying principle: triangular units ensure stability and reduce bending stress to allowable axial stress level. Larger area on diagonals expected due to high compression/tension from load at node_3. Avoid bending moments by direct axial member layout. Mass within limit for increase in area and additional member due to efficiently distributed loads. Assuring that max stress ≤20 MPa and mass ≤30 ~ achievable with optimized areas and topology changes.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Convert member stiffness area_id from 1 to 2 or 3 on loaded paths based on force direction magnitude balance. Minimize long slender tension/compression members with area 1. Add efficient short members for lateral bracing and reduce unstable bending resulting internal stresses.",
    
    "calculation": "New diagonal member areas increased: member from node_3 to node_6 3, from node_6 to node_2 3, from node_3 to new node_7 3, from node_7 to node_5 3. Replace low-volume members with minimum area 0.782 or above on compression/tension critical. Add members to triangulate load path: node_7 added at (2.5, 3.0). Check member lengths: node_3-node_7 ~3.16, node_7-node_5 ~0.54, node_7-node_4 ~0.7, total mass within 30 constraint predicted from member length and area sums.tributes.",
    "scratch_pad_final": "Ensure no duplicate nodes/members. Respect support/load fixed nodes. Final stress checks hypothesis under 20 MPa maximum tensile/compression stress with chosen cross sections. Total mass recalculated estimated under 30 units. Structure balanced for load, support conditions and constraints.",
