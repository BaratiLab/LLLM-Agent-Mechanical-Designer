Current design fails stress constraints with 383 max stress weighted towards members 9 and 11.",\n    "analysis": "Members near nodes 6 and 7, connected to node_2 and node_7, have stress > ±20 limit, notably members 9 (-213) and 11 (+383). Most load is transferred through node_3 to nodes 4, 6, 7 and eventually to support node 2. Large stresses indicate inefficient load path or insufficient section area or unsupported longer members. Mass is low enough, so increasing member areas selectively and adjusting node_6 and node_7 positions slightly upward to reduce bending and enhance truss action is prudent. Avoid increasing poor members. Revise member connectivity to add direct load path and triangulate region near top nodes and connection to node_2 support. Existing nodes for load/support fixed but reposition internal free nodes allowed.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Focus member_9 and member_11 - increase areas to higher values. Add member from node_7 to node_1 or node_4 to stiffen framework. Change positions: node_6 (4.0,1.3)-> slightly higher support to reduce bipod stresses; node_7 (2.7,3.1)-> raise to 2.9,3.3 or 2.85,3.4 for rigidity. Add a new node near 3.5 to 4.0 height between node_2 and node_6 to reduce forces and add member connections. Avoid member overlaps or duplicates.",\n    "proposal": "Keep supports and loads. Adjust internal nodes positions: node_6 to (3.95, 1.35), node_7 to (2.85, 3.30). Add node_8 at (4.2,2.6). Members: cover primary load path from node_3 through node_7 and node_6 recast with higher areas, augment connections: node_8 to node_2 with area 2, node_8 to node_5 area 1, node_8 to node_7 area 1. Increase critical member area to 4 or 5 (3.128 or 4.887) where needed. Verify no members exceed stress ±20 and mass < 30. Remove weak or highly stressed members with low contribution.",\n    "reasoning": "Increasing member cross-section for highly stressed members reduces stress. Adding node_8 bridges load path, lowering force in node_7 to node_2 direct member and reducing peak stress. Adjusting heights increases truss depth improving force distribution. Supports are pinned and roller at nodes 1 and 2 — fixed. Prioritizing axial load members. Target reducing bending and moments in members. Keep mass budget with selective area increases. Use \'area_id\' 4 or 5 for heavy load members, 2 or 1 for lighter members, preserving lightweight design. Members around top node_7 bear large forces are reinforced.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths shared: (node_6 to node_2) sqrt((6-3.95)^2 + (0-1.35)^2)=2.124m; node_7 to node_2 sqrt((6-2.85)^2 + (0-3.3)^2)=4.3m approx. Area 5 (4.887) mass cost for 4.3m: ~21kg, below max. Other members smaller. Key members chosen for larger area are 9,11, and new members via node_8.
