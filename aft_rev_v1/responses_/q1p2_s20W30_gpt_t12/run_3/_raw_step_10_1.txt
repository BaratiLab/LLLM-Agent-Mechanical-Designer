Need redesign to reduce max stress and maintain mass ≤30. Keep load & support nodes fixed.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current design has multiple intermediary nodes (4,5,6,7) and cannot maintain max stress ≤ ±20 with current member areas. Some members highly stressed, esp member_1 with -72.52. Member areas and layout cause stress concentration. Structure mostly triangular but some members long and slender. Triangular bracing can be rearranged for better load distribution and less tension/compression peaks. Mass is within global limit, mass growth allowed up to ~30.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on a simpler truss with effective triangulation from node_1 to node_2 via node_3 and one or two nodes above ground line near load. Remove some nodes to lower complexity and reduce over sized members with extreme stress. Reassign area sizes smartly near high stress members to stay within mass and stress limits. Members crossing load node_3 should support shear and axial loads efficiently.",\n\n  "proposal": "Simplified structure with nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0) as fixed boundary & load. Add two nodes above node_3 between node_1 and node_2 to create efficient triangles (node_4, node_5) optimizing member lengths and angles to reduce stress. Connect node_1 to node_4 and node_3 to node_4; node_4 to node_5; node_5 to node_2 and node_3 to node_5, and node_3 to node_2 for direct load path. Choose members with lower area ids selectively to minimize mass under stress limits.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Effective triangulation with minimal members reduces stress peaks; direct ties from load node_3 upwards disperse forces better. Mass high near support nodes but can reduce cross section to maintain stress limits. Longer members get higher area to reduce stress within limits but avoid oversizing to reduce mass. Members near load take moderate areas. Keep supports rigid and pinned to transfer force correctly.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Estimate member lengths: node_1-node_3 ~2m, node_3-node_5 ~ sqrt((x5-2)^2 + (y5-0)^2), node_5-node_2 ~ distance from node_5 to (6,0), node_4-node_5 ~ distance between nodes in upper triangle, node_1-node_4 ~ distance to left node, others similar.
