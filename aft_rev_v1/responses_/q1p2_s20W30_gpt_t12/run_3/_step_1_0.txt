  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under given load, support, and stress/mass limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load is 10N at node_3, direction -45°, max stress ±20, max mass 30, with 4 fixed nodes and 5 members, current max stress too high at 60.44 and compressive stress beyond limit.",
  
  "analysis": "The current design has high compressive stress at member_1 (-60.44) and member_5 (-24.17). Member_1 connects node_1 to node_3 with minimal area (0.195). To reduce stress, increase area or change member layout. Current total mass 8.879 is below the max mass 30, allowing members with larger areas or additional members for load distribution. Node_4 placement at (2,2) gives limited leverage for some members (members 2 and 4). Load at node_3 is downward-left (-45°). Supports are pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2, both at bottom chord, so load transferred mostly through node_3. Current layout making diagonals carry excessive compressive stress. Propose adding a new node vertically above node_3 or reposition member layout to create better triangulation and reduce compression on members 1 and 5.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Current node_3 is on the bottom chord with no vertical support. Add node above node_3 near (2,3) to improve load transfer. Use members connecting new node to existing nodes for triangulation. Areas might be increased on compressed diagonal members. Small area for tension members to save mass. Add members from new node to supports and node_4. Keep area_id 0.782 or greater on compressive members to limit stress. Recalculate member lengths and stress after layout modification.",
  
  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (2.0, 3.0). Members: node_1 - node_3 (area 0.782), node_3 - node_5 (area 3.128), node_5 - node_4 (area 1.759), node_5 - node_2 (area 0.782), node_4 - node_2 (area 0.782), node_4 - node_1 (area 0.195), node_3 - node_2 (area 0.195). Aim to reduce stresses on member_1 and member_5 by sharing load via new node and members.",
  
  "reasoning": "Adding a higher node above node_3 divides load paths vertically and horizontally. Using areas between 0.195 and 3.128 optimizes tension/compression forces. The member_1 to node_3 area increased to 0.782 reduces compressive stress. The vertical member_3-node_5 uses 3.128 area helping in vertical force transfer reducing bending effect. Diagonal members of moderate area provide stability and maintain structure integrity. This configuration forms multiple triangles and ensures better load distribution. No existing support or load node positions changed. Total member lengths stay under limits given a 6m span. Member cross sections are within given area_id constraints to keep mass below 30",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths:\n - member_1 (node_1-node_3): length=2m, area=0.782 => mass=2*0.782=1.564\n - member_3 (node_3-node_5): length=1m, area=3.128 => mass=1*3.128=3.128\n - member_6 (node_5-node_4): length=1m, area=1.759 => mass=1*1.759=1.759\n - member_7 (node_5-node_2): length=4.123m, area=0.782 => mass≈ 3.222\n - member_3(node_4-node_2): length=4.123, area=0.782 => mass=3.222\n - member_4(node_4-node_1): length=2.828, area=0.195 => mass=0.552\n - member_5(node_3-node_2): length=4, area=0.195 => mass=0.780\n Total mass ≈ 14.2 < 30, spreads stress well.",
  
  "calculation": "Maximum stress limited mostly by largest compressive member. Increasing area 0.195→0.782 on primary compressive members reduces stress by ~4 times theoretically. Dividing vertical load through new node_5 reduces bending and localized compressive forces. Members forming triangles follow classical truss principles to shift shear and bending to tension/compression only.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "The new node and member layout maintains support and load positions, uses moderate sized areas within constraints, keeps total mass well below limit, offers better load path distribution and should meet ±20 max stress constraint replacing the older less efficient design.",
