  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to satisfy max stress ±20 and mass ≤30 under given loads and supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Loads: 10 N down-left at node_3; Supports at node_1 pinned & node_2 roller. Constraints are max stress ±20 and mass ≤30. Current max stress 60.8 too high.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design (iteration 18) exceeds stress limits on member_10 (+60.8) and some others near ±30. Total mass 18.98 under limit. Reexamine node placement and topology focusing on stiffening node_4 to node_1 and better load paths from node_3 to supports. Areas should be adjusted to reduce stresses exceeding limits.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_10 experiencing tensile overstress suggests load path from node_1 to node_4 is insufficient; member areas or connectivity need revisiting. Branching at node_4 and node_7 affects load distribution. Consider elongating certain members, repositioning nodes 4 and 7 for improved force distribution and employ smaller or larger cross sections prudently.",
  
  "proposal": "Maintain supports and loads fixed. Keep existing nodes 1, 2, 3. Slightly lower node_4 (around 1.5) for shallower truss triangle for better force flow; shift node_6 closer to node_5 to shorten members carrying higher stress. Add a new intermediate node (node_8) near center above node_4 for triangulation. Simplify member layout to limit long high-stress members. Use area group mostly in 0 (1),1 (0.195),2 (0.782) to lower mass, reserve 3 (1.759) for tension members close to load and support.",
  
  "reasoning": "Reducing node_4 height reduces leverage on long member_10 under tension, helps reduce its stress. Adding node_8 roughly midway from nodes_4 to 5 or 6 increases triangulation, redistributing forces. Fewer long slender members with disproportionate stress peaks limit overstress. Bigger section areas in tension members directly transmitting load to supports are necessary to reduce stress. Smaller cross section used for compression or low force members save weight. Balancing topology to evenly distribute load paths is key.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Target max member length about 2.0 to 2.5 units. Node_4.y ≈1.5, node_7 around (2.7, 3.1). Areas for high stress members like those connected to node_3, node_2 set to at least '3'(1.759). Calculate lengths for post-positioned nodes to estimate member masses and ensure total <30. Avoid members over 4 times length bonded to small sections causing high stress.",
  
  "calculation": "Node lengths and member lengths calculated: \n - member_10 length~|node_1-node_4|=sqrt((3.0-0.0)^2+(1.5-0.0)^2)=3.354\n - member_1 length=2 (from node_1 to node_3 fixed) \nUsing section areas - for largest tension or compression members use area '3' (1.759), others area '2' (0.782), peers minimum for multiple triangulations. Member stresses expected reduced by improved node distribution and member reinforcement. Mass estimate using sum length*area approx. Total mass ~25 within limit. Expected max stress ~<20 with improved distribution and cross section assignment.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Final nodes fixed at supports and loads, and optimize interior nodes. Members connections set to cover triangulation without redundancy, area ids matching required strength and mass savings. Check for duplicate members and adherence to description instructions.",
