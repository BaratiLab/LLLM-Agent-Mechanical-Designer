Current design exceeds stress hugely (up to 950 MPa). Load applied at node_3 with -10 at -45 degrees. Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Initial structure has internal nodes around (2,2.5-3.7). Mass under limit but stress unacceptable.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High stresses are on members connected to loaded node_3 and near node_5, node_4, node_7, node_8. This indicates load path is inefficient and cross-sectional areas or geometry must be refined. Numerous members with stress values greatly exceeding ±20 are observed, indicating need to reduce internal forces or increase member areas selectively while avoiding mass explosion. Some members use area_id 1 (0.195), 2 (0.782), 3 (1.759), and 4 (3.128). Current max mass is 20.79, mass budget remains available.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider rebalancing geometry—shift internal nodes slightly to distribute load better. Reconnect members to use triangular bracing and avoid long unsupported members inducing bending. Potentially remove less effective internal nodes (like node_8) if not mandatory. Increase effective areas on members who see high stress but avoid over-sizing. Keep supports and loaded nodes fixed.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Simplify internal node setup: keep nodes stable given (node_1: (0,0), node_2: (6,0), node_3:(2,0), node_4:(3.2,2.6), node_5:(2.0,3.4), node_7:(2.5,2.9)). Remove node_8; recouple members to create strong triangulated paths from load at node_3 to supports.\\nUse areas chosen to maximize stiffness and avoid stress exceedance but keep mass moderate, focusing areas 2 to 4.\\nMember connections: [\'node_1\'-\'node_3\'(2), \'node_1\'-\'node_4\'(1), \'node_4\'-\'node_5\'(2), \'node_5\'-\'node_2\'(3), \'node_4\'-\'node_2\'(2), \'node_3\'-\'node_7\'(3), \'node_7\'-\'node_5\'(2), \'node_7\'-\'node_4\'(2), \'node_3\'-\'node_2\'(1)].",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular formations with strong members reduce bending and high stress concentrations. High stress members near load (node_3 connections) have larger cross-section areas (3, 4) to reduce stress. Lighter supporting members with area <=2 to save mass where possible. This geometry maintains load path direct to supports and avoids excessively long or slender members. Removing less effective node_8 avoids complex force patterns that increased stress previously. Ensuring all loads have clear multiple load paths.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths, use Pythagoras for length, mass=sum(length * area_weight). Areas correspond to weights from dictionary: e.g. area_id \'3\'=>1.759, etc. Stress estimated with best distribution from structure shape. Avoid area 0 because it is heavy (weight=1) not optimal sometimes.
