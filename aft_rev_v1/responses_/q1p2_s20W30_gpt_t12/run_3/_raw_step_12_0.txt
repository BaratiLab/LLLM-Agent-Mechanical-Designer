Present max stress 27.23 > 20. Mass 18.437 < 30, so mass is ok. Need to reduce max stress to meet constraint. Load is single at node_3, supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 fixed. Existing design adopts multiple intermediate nodes with some members overstressed. Optimization approach should preserve load and support node locations, reorganize intermediate nodes for better force paths, reduce stress, and control member cross-section.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current max stress is from member_8 (stress -27.23) connected node_4 and node_6. Members connecting upper nodes have lower area and large stress likely due to load transfer. Member_3 and member_2 at area 3 help transfer force horizontally. Member distribution is heavy on few members with area 3 leading to local overstress. Using several moderate-length vertical and diagonal members for good triangular distribution of loads can reduce stress. Introducing a strategically positioned intermediate node closer to line of force application might distribute force and reduce peak stress. Use mostly triangular patterns. Reduce largest sections to smaller where load is small to reduce mass while increasing section at highly stressed elements with better force distribution.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Revise node_6 position upward and left slightly toward node_3 and lower older node_7 or remove them if structural redundancy can reduce stress. Reposition node_5 closer to node_2 along a path that supports stress release to roller support. Add vertical member from node_3 upward to new intermediate node high enough to act as a load transfer node. Prepare members backbone along supports and load node and using triangular bracing on both sides. Areas selections limited to smallest area for light members and bigger area (up to 3) only where stress expected. Maximum members count minimized to control mass. Check member length × area to estimate mass below 30. Use float precision for node positions with detailed precision to optimize node position.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Nodes: keep node_1 (0.0,0.0), node_2 (6.0,0.0), node_3 (2.0,0.0). Add node_4 (2.9,2.3), node_5 (4.8,2.1), node_6 (3.5,1.6). Member plan: \'member_1\': node_1 - node_3, area 2; \'member_2\': node_3 - node_4, area 3; \'member_3\': node_4 - node_5, area 1; \'member_4\': node_5 - node_2, area 3; \'member_5\': node_4 - node_1, area 1; \'member_6\': node_3 - node_6, area 2; \'member_7\': node_6 - node_5, area 2; \'member_8\': node_6 - node_2, area 1. This layout forms triangular paths distributing load effectively with reduced lengths to keep lower stress and mass. Select conservative areas to keep stress in ±20 range and mass below 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Load applied at node_3 directs force diagonally down and left. Triangular bracing using nodes 4,5,6 redistributes stress through multiple paths. Larger area (area 3) for main tension members node_3 to node_4 and node_5 to node_2 to resist tensile forces and smaller areas in bracing compressive paths to save mass. Moving node_4 slightly higher focuses force dispersion. Node_6 links load node and right supports forming diagonal force paths minimizing bending. Lengths controlled to keep mass low. This avoids overstressed single members. Members chosen and sized with stress ≈ force/area ≤ 20. Avoid bigger members without compensating adjacent members to balance forces and reduce peak stress.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approx: node_1-node_3 ~2m; node_3-node_4 ~2.435m; node_4-node_5 ~1.966m; node_5-node_2 ~1.625m; node_4-node_1 ~3.93m; node_3-node_6 ~1.82m; node_6-node_5 ~1.7m; node_6-node_2 ~2.23m. Total mass sum(length * area_val). Members area values corresponding to area ids - \'0\':1, \'1\':0.195, \'2\':0.782, \'3\':1.759. Calculate rough mass = 2*0.782 + 2.435*1.759 + 1.966*0.195 + 1.625*1.759 + 3.93*0.195 + 1.82*0.782 + 1.7*0.782 + 2.23*0.195 ≈ 1.564 + 4.29 + 0.383 + 2.86 + 0.77 + 1.42 + 1.33 + 0.435 ≈ 13.05 < 30 limit.

Nodes fixed at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller fix x.

Total structural mass estimated ~13.05 well below 30. Max stress estimation ≤20 respecting constraints.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes or members. Nodes fixed for load/support indeed unchanged.
