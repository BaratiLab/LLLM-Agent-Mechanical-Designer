Constraints: stress limited to ±20, max mass 30.",\n  "analysis": "Current design mass 21.29 (OK), max stress 67.03 (violated), with high compressive stresses (~-67) on member_1 and tensile near 39 on member_3/9. Excessive stress at joint nodes 3,4,6,7 due to load transferring and eccentricity.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Need to reduce stress by adding intermediate nodes for force redistribution and reduce member areas lowering stiffness mismatches. Maintain support at nodes 1,2 and load at 3. Reduce large axial load in longest members crossing supports.",\n  "proposal": "Keep original supports & loaded nodes location; add intermediate nodes between the load and supports at optimized positions; redesign member connections as triangular truss with slender rods and improved force paths.",\n  "reasoning": "Triangular geometry provides efficient load transfer with less redundant members and minimization of stress peaks. Keep top chord nodes centered over supports. Shift upper nodes slightly upstream of load projection to improve compression force distribution, minimize eccentric moments forcing bending. Select areas 2 or 3 for longer tension/compression members, minimize area for short bracings.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Original node_3 is 2.0,0.0 (load), node_1 and node_2 fixed at 0,0 and 6,0. Introduce node_4 at ~3.0,2.4 for top chord to spread load, node_5 at ~4.0,1.6, and node_6 at ~3.5,0.8 as lower joint to break excess lever-arm loads. Members: 1 to 4 form triangle top chord (1-4-2), verticals and diagonals transfer the axial forces smoothly to supports.",\n  "calculation": "Member lengths calculated; member areas assigned to control stress.
