Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Existing max stress 609.94 exceeds limit; mass 15.6743 is acceptable. Need redesign for lower stress while keeping mass under 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure suffers extreme stress peaks in members 7,8,10,11 due to geometry and load path imbalance. Areas might be oversized or extremely stressed in limited members causing inefficient design. Triangulation is partial in upper chords. Some members carry very high compressive or tensile forces beyond limits. Structure nonlinearities or buckle prone members not addressed. Members like node_6-node_2 bear excessive stress, suggesting force redistribution required.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Improve geometry by reinforcing load transfer path from node_3 load to supports; add stronger triangulation northwest and southeast. Adjust node_6 and node_7 positions slightly to create symmetric stable geometry. Reduce areas in low stressed members, increase cross section in critical load paths. Raise node_7 upwards to form stable truss. Remove weak members causing buckling and transfer load. Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Try balanced triangle mesh to spread stresses.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Nodes: Keep node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), and node_3 (2,0). Position new nodes at node_4 (3.1, 2.6), node_5 (4.8, 2.0), node_6 (3.9, 1.1), node_7 (2.7, 3.1). Members with areas from set { \'0\':1, \'1\':0.195, \'2\':0.782, \'3\':1.759 }. Connect members forming stable triangles: node_1-node_3 (0.782), node_3-node_7 (1.759), node_7-node_4 (0.782), node_4-node_6 (0.782), node_6-node_5 (0.195), node_5-node_2 (0.782), node_7-node_5 (0.195), node_4-node_1 (0.195), node_6-node_2 (0.195), node_3-node_6 (0.195), node_7-node_2 (0.195). Mass gains minimal, stresses reduced by balanced force path.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Raising node_7 and node_4 improves triangulation load transfer; areas selected small/moderate to limit mass but sufficient for stresses within ±20. Member connectivity reduces long sections under high stress. Members closest to load have area 1 or 3 for good stiffness; lines further away decreased for mass savings. Combining axial force path through stable triangular loops redistributes forces effectively. Axial stresses scale with force and inverse area; increasing area modestly on critical arcs lowers stress below limit. Symmetry reduces buckling.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "A = { \'0\':1, \'1\':0.195, \'2\':0.782, \'3\':1.759 } selected for area_id assignments optimizing capacity mass. Member lengths: calculated between given coordinates for mass and expected axial capacities. Wrist joint elevated to increase force push from the diagonal pull of the load at node_3. Pin/roller supports at nodes 1 and 2 anchor base. Load at node_3 converted to axial forces in connected members. Ensure all member stresses |σ| ≤ 20. Total mass as sum(length*area) ≤ 30. Adjusted layout minimizes long slender compression members to avoid buckling failures.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Lengths: node_1-node_3=2.0 m; node_3-node_7 = sqrt( (2.7-2.0)^2+(3.1-0)^2 )=3.11m; node_7-node_4= sqrt((3.1-2.7)^2 + (2.6-3.1)^2)=0.64m; node_4-node_6= sqrt((3.9-3.1)^2+(1.1-2.6)^2)=1.69m; node_6-node_5= sqrt((4.8-3.9)^2+(2.0-1.1)^2)=1.27m; node_5-node_2= sqrt((6.0-4.8)^2)=1.2m approx.
