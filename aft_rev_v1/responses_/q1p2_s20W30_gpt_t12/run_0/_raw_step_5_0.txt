Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Current max stress 50 exceeds limit. Mass 22.1 < max 30. Nodes at base fixed, can add/move other nodes.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design fails due to member_5 with stress ~50 (>20). This member runs between node_1 and node_4 with area_id 2. Member_5 is overloaded, indicating poor load path and stress concentration. Mass is acceptable. Other stresses near zero or low. Member_2 with zero stress likely slack.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_5 carries too much load; decrease stress by redesigning. Possibly add an additional support node between nodes 1 and 5 or reroute load to reduce tensile stress. Keep load and supports fixed. Node_4 shifted upward may help, but previous attempts show marginal improvement unless configuration changed. Increased triangulation may stabilize.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add an additional node (node_6) between node_4 and node_5 coordinates shifted to create better load paths. Connect node_6 to node_3, node_5, and optionally node_4 to form a stiffer triangular system. Adjust areas to reduce stresses, increase area for members under higher stress but within mass budget. Reduce area in member_5. Propose connected members: member_1 node_1-node_3 area=3, member_2 node_3-node_4 area=4, member_3 node_4-node_6 area=1, member_4 node_6-node_5 area=1, member_5 node_5-node_2 area=3, member_6 node_1-node_4 area=2, member_7 node_3-node_6 area=1.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Introducing node_6 redistributes forces from node_3 area and direct tension in member_5 by shorter segments and additional triangular bracing, reducing peak tensile stress. Increased connectivity enhances stiffness and load distribution. Selecting smaller area members on less stressed lines and larger areas on main compressive members keeps mass under limit and stress highs within ±20.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Estimate mass by summing member lengths × area coefficients from lookup. Lengths roughly from coordinates: check candidates. Stress expected lowered by subdividing high stress paths. Keep total mass about current mass or less than 30 max.
