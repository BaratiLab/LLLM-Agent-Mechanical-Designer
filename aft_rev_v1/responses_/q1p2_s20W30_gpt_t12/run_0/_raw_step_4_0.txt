Node_4 and node_5 movable.",\n  "analysis": "Stress reduced from past iterations but highest stress is on member_2 (10.76) and member_3 (9.44). Member_5 shows zero stress indicating possible redundancy or load path inefficiency. Total mass reasonably below 30. Position of node_4 dropped from 2.6 to 1.65 (Y) improved stress. Further subtle adjustments can reduce peak stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_5 zero stress suggests optimizing or reorienting node_4 can reduce stress concentration on adjacent members. Shift node_4 slightly higher and horizontally to balance forces. Node_5 also can move slightly affecting member_3 & 4. Load node_3 fixed; may increase distance from node_4 to redistribute force inversely with member length.",\n  "reasoning": "Member stresses correlate with length, angle, and section area. Member_2 currently highest tensile stress; increasing length or changing angle to reduce force magnitude worthwhile. Member_5 zero stress can be reduced area to lighten mass or rerouted/realigned nodes to activate axial load. Since total mass near but below limit, some redistribution of cross-sectional area may help reduce maximum stresses.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Input areas: Select among 0 to 10. Current design uses areas 1, 3, 4. Cross-section must be balanced to stress distribution. Node_4 and node_5 can be repositioned to minimize stress peaks. Recompute member lengths using distance formula for new node coordinates.

Move node_5 from (4.5,3.5) to (4.6,3.3) to slightly reduce tension on member_3. Adjust member_5 area from 3 to 2 (0.782) to lessen stiffness and zero-stress member cable effect, lowering overall mass slightly.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "New node positions increase vertical component slightly for node_4 for better force transfer.
