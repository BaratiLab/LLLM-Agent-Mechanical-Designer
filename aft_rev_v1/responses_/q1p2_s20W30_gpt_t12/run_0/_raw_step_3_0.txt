Current max stress is 5.33 with total mass 25.1254.

Member_2 and member_4 have zero stresses indicating possible overdimension or inefficient force flow. Slight movement of free nodes (node_4, node_5) can redistribute forces and reduce peak stress further.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Check if repositioning node_4/node_5 can minimize stress in member_3 while keeping closed truss and total mass < 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Move node_4 slightly downward and left to reduce elongation/compression on member_3 which has max compressive stress. Adjust node_5 slightly upwards to redistribute load paths between members 3 & 4 reducing zero stress members. Keep within area ids previously assigned to maintain mass control. Keeping member connections and areas stable allows verifying stress reduction from position improvements.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member3 length decrease reduces stress magnitude there; increasing length in zero stress members may activate them to better carry loads, uniformly distributing stress and potentially lowering max stress also keeping mass in check.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Current node_4 (1.75, 2.8) → new approx (1.65, 2.6) lowers vertical height -0.2, reducing member_3 stress.
