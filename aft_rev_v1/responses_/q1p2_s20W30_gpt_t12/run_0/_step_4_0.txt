  "preamble": "Optimize the 2D truss to minimize stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress Â±20, max mass 30, load at node_3 (-10, -45), supports at nodes 1 and 2 fixed. Current max stress 10.76 under limit, mass 24.42 under limit. Node_4 and node_5 movable.",
  "analysis": "Stress reduced from past iterations but highest stress is on member_2 (10.76) and member_3 (9.44). Member_5 shows zero stress indicating possible redundancy or load path inefficiency. Total mass reasonably below 30. Position of node_4 dropped from 2.6 to 1.65 (Y) improved stress. Further subtle adjustments can reduce peak stress.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_5 zero stress suggests optimizing or reorienting node_4 can reduce stress concentration on adjacent members. Shift node_4 slightly higher and horizontally to balance forces. Node_5 also can move slightly affecting member_3 & 4. Load node_3 fixed; may increase distance from node_4 to redistribute force inversely with member length.",
  "reasoning": "Member stresses correlate with length, angle, and section area. Member_2 currently highest tensile stress; increasing length or changing angle to reduce force magnitude worthwhile. Member_5 zero stress can be reduced area to lighten mass or rerouted/realigned nodes to activate axial load. Since total mass near but below limit, some redistribution of cross-sectional area may help reduce maximum stresses.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Input areas: Select among 0 to 10. Current design uses areas 1, 3, 4. Cross-section must be balanced to stress distribution. Node_4 and node_5 can be repositioned to minimize stress peaks. Recompute member lengths using distance formula for new node coordinates. Target peak stress below 10 with mass under 30.",
  "calculation": "Shift node_4 from (1.65,2.6) to (1.75,2.9) to improve load distribution, spreading force through members_2 and _5. Move node_5 from (4.5,3.5) to (4.6,3.3) to slightly reduce tension on member_3. Adjust member_5 area from 3 to 2 (0.782) to lessen stiffness and zero-stress member cable effect, lowering overall mass slightly.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New node positions increase vertical component slightly for node_4 for better force transfer. Minimized over-stressing member_2, retain open connectivity without duplicates. Cross-section adjustments keep mass below limit. Expected stress max under 10, mass ~24.",
