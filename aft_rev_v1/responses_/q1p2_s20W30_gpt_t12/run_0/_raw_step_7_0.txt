Stable closed truss with 7 nodes and 8 members. Load at node_3, pinned node_1 and roller node_2 fixed.",\n  "analysis": "Max stress has significantly reduced compared to past iterations with stable geometry. No members exceed limits. Mass well below maximum. Nodes near load spread for good force distribution. Current member areas are appropriate for stresses.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further stress reduction would require major geometry change or added members, catastrophic for mass or node limits. Present design balances control of stress and low mass.",\n  "reasoning": "Load at node_3 well supported by stable triangular substructures formed in upper region (nodes 4,7,6,5). Chosen member cross-sections balance mass and capacity. Moving internal free nodes minimally impacts stress; main constraints respected. Adding members increases mass and complexity.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Max compressive tensile stress under Â±20 met. Mass under 30 met. All constraints upheld. Recommended to stop as stress and mass margins exist.",\n  "calculation": "Total mass 24.467 less than 30. Max stress 9.2466 well below 20. Member areas selected from available sizes increasing reinforcement where stress is higher. No member at zero area. Member lengths combined with areas match mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Confirm no nodes at loaded/support moved, no duplicates in members/nodes, areas compliant with constraints.
