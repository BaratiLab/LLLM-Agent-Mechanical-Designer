  "preamble": "Refines node 4 and 5 positions for lower stress and mass while maintaining constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Stress must be minimized with max ±20; total mass must stay below 30. Current max stress is 5.33 with total mass 25.1254. Load/support nodes fixed.",
  
  "analysis": "Current structure shows low stress below limits; stress largely on member_3 and members connecting node_4 and node_5. Member_2 and member_4 have zero stresses indicating possible overdimension or inefficient force flow. Slight movement of free nodes (node_4, node_5) can redistribute forces and reduce peak stress further.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Check if repositioning node_4/node_5 can minimize stress in member_3 while keeping closed truss and total mass < 30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Move node_4 slightly downward and left to reduce elongation/compression on member_3 which has max compressive stress. Adjust node_5 slightly upwards to redistribute load paths between members 3 & 4 reducing zero stress members. Keep within area ids previously assigned to maintain mass control. Keeping member connections and areas stable allows verifying stress reduction from position improvements.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member3 length decrease reduces stress magnitude there; increasing length in zero stress members may activate them to better carry loads, uniformly distributing stress and potentially lowering max stress also keeping mass in check.",
  
  "calculation": "Current node_4 (1.75, 2.8) → new approx (1.65, 2.6) lowers vertical height -0.2, reducing member_3 stress. Node_5 (4.35, 3.3) → new approx (4.5, 3.5) slight raise to activate member_4. Estimated no increase in mass or constraints breach. ",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Positions chosen to improve stress distribution and reduce max stress from ~5.3 downward without increasing mass beyond 30 or violating support/load conditions.",
