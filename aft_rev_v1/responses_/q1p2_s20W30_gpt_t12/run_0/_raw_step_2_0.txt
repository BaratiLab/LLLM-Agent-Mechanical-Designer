Slightly shifting node_4 and node_5 may reduce stress concentration by creating better load paths and less eccentric force transfer.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress almost 14.1 in a short member with smallest area 1. Mass is high on members 2 (area 4) and 4 & 5 (area 3). Member_3 too thin, should reduce tensile load via geometry; cannot increase area further due to mass, so reposition nodes.",\n  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 slightly left (x<2) closer towards center helps reduce tension in member_3, while moving node_5 slightly higher increases slope of member_4 dispersing force more evenly. Node_4 and node_5 not loads/support, hence movable. Maintain closure of truss (closed polygon with 5 nodes). Keep node_3 fixed loading node and supports fixed as instructed.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths calculated for changed positions to estimate mass. Member areas are fixed. Recalculate approximate member lengths and expect marginal decrease in tensile stress via minor geometry shift; maintain mass <30, stress max abs <20.",\n  "calculation": "Move node_4 from (2,3) to (1.75, 2.8), node_5 from (4,3) to (4.35, 3.3). This slightly increases member_4 & 5 length but redistributes load reducing tensile load on member_3. Verify masses remain below 30 and stresses estimated to reduce to about 12-13 < 14.11. Members remain closed shape with connectivity intact.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Adjusted node_4 left/down and node_5 right/up improves stress in critical member_3, keeps total mass under 30, stress max under 20, valid areas from area set maintained.
