To maintain a closed truss, must add at least one node above (y>0) to generate triangulation. Adding a node above node_3 creates triangular members distributing load and forces effectively. Keep added node near node_3 to minimize member length and mass. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) fix structure horizontally. Load at node_3 (-10 N at -45 deg) applies compressive and shear effects needing members to react in tension and compression.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Closest stable closed configuration is a triangle or quadrilateral including newly added node close to node_3, avoid long members to keep mass low. Member pairs involving node_1 to new node, node_2 to new node, node_3 to new node and original horizontal members node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2 can provide triangulation and stability.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "To balance forces and maintain low stress, triangulation is key. Members connecting node_1-node_2, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3 form base triangle. Adding a fourth node (node_4) above node_3 near (2.0, 1.5) establishes two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_3, node_2, node_4), closing the shape. Member area assignment should reflect estimated axial forces: larger cross-section where tensile/compressive stress expected to be higher (horizontal base members), moderate sizes for vertical/diagonal members closer to load. Approximating member forces by static equilibrium ignoring bending gives peak axial force magnitude around or below 20 for areas chosen.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Area selection weighted: base members larger area_id=4 (3.128), diagonal members area_id=2 (0.782) or 1 (0.195) if very lightly loaded, to stay below total mass 30. Calculate length of each member and sum length × area to verify mass < 30. Axial force approximated by statics, F=load distribution, stress=F/(area*1). Check max stress ≤20 similarly. Assume unit modulus and thickness for simplicity.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Coordinates: node_4 at (2.0, 1.5), close but non-colinear. Member lengths: L_1-2=6.0m, L_1-3=2.0m, L_2-3=4.0m, L_1-4=√((2-0)^2 + (1.5-0)^2)=√(4+2.25)=2.5m, L_3-4=1.5m, L_2-4=√((6-2)^2 + (0-1.5)^2)=√(16+2.25)=4.31m. Assign area: node1-node2: area 4 (3.128), node1-node3: area 3 (1.759), node2-node3: area 2 (0.782), node1-node4: 2 (0.782), node3-node4: 1 (0.195), node2-node4: 2 (0.782). Mass sum: (6*3.128) + (2*1.759) + (4*0.782) + (2.5*0.782) + (1.5*0.195) + (4.31*0.782) ≈ 18.77 + 3.52 + 3.13 + 1.96 + 0.29 + 3.37 = 31.04 slightly over, reduce base from 3.128 to 2 (area_id=3 with 1.759 or 2 is 0.782?). Let\'s assign node1-node2 as area_id=3 (1.759) instead. Then mass: (6*1.759)+(2*1.759)+(4*0.782)+(2.5*0.782)+(1.5*0.195)+(4.31*0.782)=10.55+3.52+3.13+1.96+0.29+3.37=22.82 <30 Pass.
