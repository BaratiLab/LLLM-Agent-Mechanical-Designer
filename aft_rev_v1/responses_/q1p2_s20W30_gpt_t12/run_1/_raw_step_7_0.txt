Recheck member lengths for area recalculation.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Moving node_5 from (3.0, 2.6) closer towards node_3 along vertical (e.g. down to y=2.3) reduces member_5 length and potential stress. Member_4 carries significant mass (area 4), decreasing node_5 y reduces length and member_4 mass slightly. Maintaining area_ids close to current since reducing area may increase stress above limit.
