Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Node_1 and node_2 are fixed. Current max stress 92.45 >20 limit. Total mass 30.69 >30 limit also. Need to reduce stress and mass significantly. Current high stress on member_4 (node_4-node_5) causing failure. This member has minimal mass but excessive stress, indicating poor load transfer or geometry.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The excessive tensile stress on member_4 indicates poor load path at top chord near load. The topology with nodes_4 and 5 placed at (2,2.4) and (3,2.2) may cause inefficient member force distribution and joint instability. The current asymmetric top nodes and long diagonal members increase stress in small area members. Large cross-sections (area_id=3 corresponds to 1.759 area units) increase mass without effectively reducing stress in slender members. Mass distributes unevenly causing stress concentrations.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress and mass, we simplify the truss by repositioning top nodes to better triangulate load path and add a connecting member to stabilize top structure. Choose areas more efficiently balancing moment resistance and mass. Node_5 will be removed to simplify and avoid stress concentration on member_4.",\n  \n  "proposal": "New design keeping nodes_1, 2, and 3 fixed. Remove node_5. Add node_4 higher at (2,3.0) to create stronger triangle with nodes_1 and 3 to transfer load down more efficiently. Members: node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_2-node_4. Use areas sized to maintain stresses below ±20. Assign mostly area_id=2 (0.782), with increased areas only where needed especially tension members from node_3 to nodes_1 and 4.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Load downward and left at node_3 requires top chord strong enough to transfer tension/compression effectively to supports. Triangular topology ensures axial loads only and stiffness. By removing node_5, reducing slender tension members, we spread forces on more members of reasonable cross-section, reducing peak stresses. Raising node_4 to 3.0 increases tensile path length to improve load distribution. Assigning moderate areas (0.782) reduces total mass relative to previous (1.759) while maintaining required strength per stress formula approximately linear with area. This approach supported by earlier configurations with better stress/mass trade-off.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and then individual mass as length × cross-sectional area. Check max tensile or compressive stress is below 20. Approximate member forces from static equilibrium at load node. Member length approximations to verify total mass below 30.
