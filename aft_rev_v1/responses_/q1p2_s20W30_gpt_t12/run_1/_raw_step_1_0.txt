Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Current max stress 36.26 > 20 limit, mass 22.79 < 30 limit. Need to reduce stress especially in member_5. Node_4 used as intermediate node; consider repositioning or redesigning members to distribute stresses better.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current member_5 connecting node_3 and node_4 has excessive compressive stress (-36.26) exceeding limit. This member carries significant force which suggests that the load path here is inefficient. The triangulation with node_4 is weak. The member_1 (node_1-node_2) also has large mass suggesting area or length inefficiency. Redesign can improve load distribution, reduce excessive stress by introducing another intermediate node and modifying connectivity to better triangulate the load at node_3, potentially reducing stress concentration on member_5.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Stress reduction requires better force path. Adding another node above node_4 exposing pure tension-compression members in triangle can share load better. Also re-assign cross-sectional areas optimizing mass vs strength conflict. Possibly relocate node_4 slightly upwards and add node_5 near node_3 above to form a trapezoid structure enhancing force transfer. Adjust members and areas accordingly.",\n\n    "proposal": "Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Move node_4 to (2.0, 2.4) and add node_5 at (3.0, 2.2). Members revised to form triangulated load path distributing stresses: \'member_1\': node_1-node_3 area 4 (3.128), \'member_2\': node_2-node_3 area 3 (1.759), \'member_3\': node_1-node_4 area 4 (3.128), \'member_4\': node_4-node_5 area 3 (1.759), \'member_5\': node_5-node_3 area 4 (3.128), \'member_6\': node_2-node_5 area 3 (1.759), \'member_7\': node_4-node_2 area 2 (0.782). This layout forms multiple triangles effectively spanning load path to supports.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Relocating node_4 upwards gives the truss height to counter bending and shear. Adding node_5 creates effective triangulation distributing compressive forces. Duplication of direct connections avoided. Assigning moderate area sizes balances strength and mass. Smaller areas on less critical members to save weight. Triangles nodes_1-3-4 and nodes_2-3-5 spread load. Node_4-node_5 addresses the vertical load path reducing stress on member_5 critical previously.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "New node positions: node_4=(2.0,2.4), node_5=(3.0,2.2).
