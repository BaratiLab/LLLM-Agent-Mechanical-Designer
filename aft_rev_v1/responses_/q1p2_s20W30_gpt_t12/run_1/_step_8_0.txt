  "preamble": "Stable 2D truss with minimal stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current max stress 14.42, mass 27.01. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Members use areas 2-4. Node_5 adjusted to modulate member lengths and stresses.",
  "analysis": "Current structure satisfies stress and mass constraints with a comfortable margin for max stress and total mass. Members with highest stresses are within ±15. Member areas assigned fairly, with larger areas for significant load paths. Current geometry forms a closed polygon with 5 nodes.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Nodal movement restricted to free nodes; load and supports fixed. Node_5 movement between iterations impacts stress distribution. Further node fine-tuning yields marginal stress improvement. No nodes duplications or member overlaps.",
  "reasoning": "Stress distributed well by current geometry and area choices. Large area (area 4) for highly loaded member (member_4) from node_1 to node_5 reduces stress magnitude. Balanced tensile/compressive stresses. Mass below limit provides stability against overdesign. Structure is a closed polygon with triangulation which improves stiffness and stress distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Revisited member stresses and corresponding areas. Verifying no member stress exceeded constraint: max |stress| = 14.42 < 20. Checked total mass accounting member lengths times area factors consistent with inputs. Node_5 location adjusts triangular geometry to optimize stress paths, slight lowering node 5 less beneficial according to history, current optimal at (3.0, 2.3).",
  "calculation": "No specific reallocation of areas better than current settings. Lengths from nodes stable, best stress reduction by current geometry node_5 (3.0, 2.3).",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Current design is balanced, constraints met including safety margin. Further attempts to optimize geometry or areas likely yield diminishing returns due to forced support and load node fixes. Stop optimization.",
