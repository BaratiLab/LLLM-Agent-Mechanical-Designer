Member_1 has highest compressive stress (-13.06) and is a primary member from node_1 to node_3. Load applied at node_3. Supports fixed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_1 is overstressed compared to others. Increasing height of node_4 may reduce bending/moment effects on node_3 and load path, potentially lowering member_1 compression force. Current horizontal nodes are fixed at supports and load node positions, so vertical adjustment of node_4 only permissible move. Selected area assignments reduce mass but may need fine tuning on heavily loaded members. Current design is stable and closed with 4 nodes forming a triangle and chord. The angle at node_3 with node_1 and node_4 critically affects load distribution.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing node_4 from 3.0 to ~3.6 or slightly above should reduce bending load transferred through node_3 compression on member_1. This also shifts load towards members connected to node_4 and node_2. Reassign area for member_1 possibly from 2 to 1, if stress reduces sufficiently and total mass stays below limits. Member_2 and member_4 areas seem adequate to carry tensile load and compression. Need to ensure new node position maintains closure and no duplicate nodes.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Raising node_4 in vertical direction reduces extreme compression at member_1 as vertical load path improves along inclined members. Reducing member_1 area cautiously lowers mass and stress but only feasible with adjusted geometry. Keeping pinned and roller fixed, load node fixed, allows controlled shape change for stiffening. Members areas mostly consistent with their length and stress magnitudes to maintain constraints. Small vertical increments in node_4 allow sampling minimum stress without violating mass constraints. Final area ids: member_1: 1 (0.195), member_2: 3 (1.759), member_3: 2 (0.782), member_4: 3 (1.759), member_5: 2 (0.782) is a valid next step with node_4 = 3.6.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculation with node_4 at (2.0, y). For member_1 (node_1 to node_3): length = 2.0 -0 = 2.0. For member_3: (node_1 to node_4) length = sqrt((2.0-0)^2 + (y-0)^2) = sqrt(4 + y^2). At y=3.6, length approx 4.313. Increase in member_3 length but stress reduces. Mass balances due to area choice from table. Total mass = sum(length * area) approximate 20 reducing allowable stress for member_1.
