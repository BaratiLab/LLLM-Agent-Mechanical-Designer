Ensure max tension/compression stress ≤ 20, and total mass ≤ 30. Keep support and load nodes fixed in position. Prior structure is complex with multiple intermediate nodes, some members overstressed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current max stress is 30.44, exceeding limit 20. Total mass 9.7572 is within limit. The critical overstressed member is member_2 with area 0.195 under compression -30.44. Larger areas could reduce stress. Members around loaded node (node_3) bear high loads. The structure could be simplified, increasing area on highly stressed members and adjusting node_6 to reduce bending stresses from load, also connect direct braces from load node to supports to give axial force paths.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Key stress reductions by: increasing cross-sectional area especially from node_3 to supports; adding braces from load node directly to supports if possible; optimize height and positions of intermediate nodes to distribute load better. Avoid unnecessary members carrying low loads adding mass. Current members with zero area could increase for load transfer.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Maintain fixed support nodes node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), load at node_3(2,0). Remove node_6 since it carries much load but connects with small cross section. Introduce optimized triangular nodes: node_4 near (2.1, 2.9), node_5 near (4.8, 2.0) to form truss top chord and diagonal mid braces to efficiently transfer load. Use larger area \'3\'(1.759) for heavily stressed diagonal members, area \'2\'(0.782) for compression members, smaller where forces are low. Connect node_1 - node_3 - node_2 bottom chord, node_3 - node_4, node_4 - node_5, node_5 - node_2, node_4 - node_1, diagonal braces node_3 - node_5 and node_4 - node_2 for load distribution.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing node_6 reduces complexity and removes low-area stressed members. Adding top chord and braces creates direct axial load paths. Increasing member cross sectional areas reduces stresses below limits. Triangular shapes increase structure stiffness. Using node_4 and node_5 coordinates slightly varied from last iteration to balance load transfer and stress. Areas are sized according to expected force nature - larger areas for compression/tension critical members. This ensures max stress ≤ 20 and mass under 30 because heavier members are limited to few critical members and overall structure remains light and efficient.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths and areas, estimate stresses roughly by assigning heavier areas in nearest high force path.
