Load at node_3 causes high compression along member_1 due to limited force path options. Current topology with node_3 between supports insufficient to transfer force safely. Member areas partially large but insufficient to reduce stress below limit.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, modify geometry and connectivity: add a support or redistribution nodes to create triangular substructures for better load paths. Increase cross-sectional area in high-stress members but also improve geometry for force flow.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add one new node \'node_5\' above node_3 at approx. (3.0, 4.0) forming two separate load paths to supports, revise members connecting node_3 and node_5, connect node_5 additionally to nodes_1 and 2 creating triangular trusses. Increase area sizes selectively with IDs 3 or 4 for highly loaded members. Remove direct node_4-node_2 to redistribute stresses. Keep existing load and supports. Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4 (shifted slightly left-down), 5 (new).",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 above load relieves node_3 compressive loading by alternative compressed/tension elements. Triangles stabilize and distribute moments. Removing long diagonals avoids high slenderness and localized compression. Upgrade areas for load-bearing members reduces stress. This strategic stiffening and force redistribution meet stress and mass constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Estimate lengths and areas: increase critical member area at node_1-node_3 (member_1), and newly created members node_5-node_1 and node_5-node_2 with area id 4 (3.128), mid members with id 3 (1.759), minor members minimum area 1 (0.195). Check member stress roughly falls below 20. Sum mass should remain below 30.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3 (2.0), node_3-node_5 (≅4.12), node_5-node_1 (≅5.0), node_5-node_2 (≅3.61), node_3-node_4 shifted to (1.7,2.5) length about 2.11, node_4-node_1 (≈3.03). Mass approximated = sum(length * area), estimate ≈ (2*3.128)+(4.12*1.759)+(5*3.128)+(3.61*3.128)+(2.11*0.195)+(3.03*0.195) ≈ 6.256 + 7.238 +15.64 +11.3 +0.412 + 0.59 = ~41.4 too high. Reduce areas in minor members or adjust node_5 down to reduce longer members: make node_5 at (3.1,3.2), shorter lengths, and pick areas 2 or 3 for members.
