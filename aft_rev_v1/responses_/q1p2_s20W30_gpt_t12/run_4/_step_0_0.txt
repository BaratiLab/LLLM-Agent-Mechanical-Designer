    "preamble" :  "Optimize 2D truss to minimize stress under given loads/supports, ensure closed structure within mass and stress limits.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes fixed at node_1(0,0,pinned), node_2(6,0,roller), node_3(2,0) with load at node_3 down-left at 45°. Must add extra nodes/members to close truss.",
    
    "analysis": "To ensure a closed truss from 3 collinear nodes requires introduction of at least one additional node elevated above baseline to form triangles. Load at node_3 is large and at 45°, cause tension and compression. Max stress ±20 and max mass 30 constrain member cross-sections and lengths. Support conditions stabilize x/y. Plan: add one new node above node_3 (say node_4), at (2, y>0). Connect members to form two triangles: node_1–node_4–node_3 and node_3–node_4–node_2, closing truss with no duplicated members. Select cross-sections from given to meet stress and mass.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2, 3.0) to create adequate depth. Members: (node_1-node_3), (node_2-node_3), (node_3-node_4), (node_4-node_1), (node_4-node_2). Check lengths, stresses, masses soon.",
    
    "reasoning": "Introducing node_4 + members forms two stable triangles distributing load effectively. Two supports give reaction forces. Member lengths calculable by Euclidean distance. Axial forces by equilibrium approx. Max stress = force / (Area). Iterate suitable areas to keep stress ≤20. Mass = sum(length×area). Area chosen from given set ensuring mass≤30. Assume linear-elastic truss members, static equilibrium. Distribution of forces assumed proportional to geometry, with longer members carrying less force. Use trigonometry for length and estimate force direction components.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: L(node_1-node_3)=2.0, L(node_3-node_2)=4.0, L(node_3-node_4)=3.0, L(node_4-node_1)=~3.6056, L(node_4-node_2)=~4.4721. Sum mass as length*area. Analyze forces considering load vector (-10N at 45° down-left). Assume equal axial force share on symmetric members node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4. Estimate maximum axial force doesn't exceed 20×area.",
    
    "calculation": "Members lengths (floats):\
L13=2.0, L32=4.0, L34=3.0, L41=√(2²+3²)=3.605551275, L42=√(4²+3²)=4.472135955.\
Estimated minimal Areas set to keep stress ≤ 20:\
Start with minimal areas for short members: use smaller areas for lengths with less force. Assume max force ~10N for largest load. Calculate stress = force / area.\
Mass = sum(L × Area):\
Try areas Area(node_1-node_3)=1 (length 2*1=2), Area(node_3-node_2)=1 (4*1=4), Area(node_3-node_4)=0.782 (3*0.782=2.346), Area(node_4-node_1)=0.782 (3.60555 *0.782=~2.82), Area(node_4-node_2)=0.782 (4.47214*0.782=3.5).\
Total mass ≈ 2+4+2.346+2.82+3.5=14.66 < 30 OK.\
Max stress check:\
Maximum force from 10N load should distribute across multiple members.\
Force on longest members ~ 8N approx, stress=force/area → 8/0.782=~10.23<20 OK.\
All members meet stress constraint.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Added node_4 at (2,3). Members connect to form two triangles meeting closure. Area selections balance stress and mass constraints. Supports and loads respected. No duplicated nodes or members. Node positions precise float values.",
