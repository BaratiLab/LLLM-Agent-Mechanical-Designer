    "preamble": "Current structure meets all constraints with low max stress and acceptable mass.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective is minimizing stress under ±20 units and mass ≤ 30; load at node_3, supports fixed at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Areas and nodal positions mostly satisfactory.",
    "analysis": "The max stress is 13.41 (< 20), and total mass is 24.25 (< 30), indicating a well-balanced design. Stress distribution is fairly low across members, including compressed and tensile forces. No constraint violations. Node_4 and node_5 placement provides good triangulation for stability. Members have suitable areas balancing weight and stress.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "Adjusting nodal positions slightly might reduce stresses further but gains would be marginal given current values. Areas are chosen sensibly. No overstressed members or large mass margins suggesting oversizing.",
    "reasoning": "Attempting smaller area reductions risks surpassing stress limits. Moving non-load/support nodes further risks increased member lengths and stress increments. Current design has multi-triangulation with node_4 and node_5 enhancing stiffness and spreading loads evenly, proven by low max stress.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Member stress margins: max 13.41 < 20 limit and balanced load paths. Mass is well under max 30 despite a few members with large section areas (3,2). Structural geometry inherently stable—reducing member areas threatens stability; increasing areas unwarranted due to unnecessary weight penalty.",
    "calculation": "No recalculations needed outside follow iteration design heuristics. Moving node_4 downward would increase stress on members connecting to node_4 and node_5; shifting node_5 closer to node_2 could concentrate stress and reduce area effectiveness. Thus, maintaining current nodal coordinates optimal.",
    "scratch_pad_final": "Current design satisfies all constraints and optimization goals numerically and geometrically. Minimal stress at total mass comfortable within limits. No evidence of feasible improvement without violating constraints or adding complexity.",
