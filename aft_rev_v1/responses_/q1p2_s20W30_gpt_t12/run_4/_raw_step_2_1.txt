Load is at node_3, force -10 at -45°. Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2 fixed. We have existing nodes at base and load but nodes 4 and 5 can be adjusted or new nodes inserted. Areas used span from 1 to 7 volumes. We can reduce large stressed members, redistribute load, and lower mass by better topology.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_4 between node_4 and node_1 bears excessive tensile stress (70.4), indicating overloading or geometry causing local stress amplification. Mass is dominated by members with large cross sections and lengths: \'member_1\',\'member_2\',\'member_6\',\'member_7\'. Load is pulling node_3 downward to left, so top nodes should better distribute forces and provide triangulation. Current nodes 4 and 5 may be suboptimal or mis-positioned, causing uneven load paths. Previous iteration had fewer nodes, less mass but higher stress max on member_1 (-52.38). Now with more nodes, mass increased but stress worsened, indicating ineffective design refinement.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider closer node placement near load, re-triangulation with nodes under load. Possible positions: node_4 near node_3 to capture compression bars, node_5 closer to mid-span or shifted to geometry creating better force paths. Reduce areas of highly stressed members, increase areas on members transmitting load safely. Remove members that do not contribute structurally or cause stress concentration.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add one node to tighten load region triangulation between node_3 and supports. Move node_4 near node_3 vertically higher, reposition node_5 to help lateral stability. Redefine members to form stable triangles: from load node into both supports via nodes 4 and new node_6. Reduce large areas except on compressive member connecting loaded node and support paths. Specifically: Keep nodes 1,2,3 (fixed nodes); set node_4 at (2.2,2.8), node_5 at (4.7,1.9), node_6 at (3.6,0.6). Members: node_1-node_3 (area \'2\'), node_3-node_4 (\'1\'), node_3-node_6 (\'3\'), node_6-node_2 (\'1\'), node_6-node_5 (\'0\'), node_5-node_4 (\'0\'), node_5-node_2 (\'1\'), node_4-node_1 (\'2\'). This triangulation reduces member length and distributes stress more evenly.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Using a three-node triangulation clusters load dispersal paths. Keeping slender areas on less stressed members saves mass. Members near load with controlled cross-sectional area handling stress safely lead to mass reduction and stress compliance. Adding node to support intermediate transfers reduces longest member spans reducing bending stress risks. Maintain pinned and roller supports at fixed base with appropriate restraints. Force equilibrium and compatibility assumed linear elastic for simplicity.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Configure node positions matching load close and distributed topology, calculate each member length, assign areas conservatively, estimate stress ratio ratio.Critical compressive force approx 10√2 = 14.14N via member from node_3 at -45°. Ordinarily, max allowed stress = 20 units. Check lengths ~ member length between (0,0) to (2,0) is 2m minimum, use area \'2\'=0.782; stress=simplified force/(area×E) less than limit? Dummy confirming sizes limit stress better than prior design began at \'4\' and \'3\' causing oversize and stress. Nice grouping reduces peak. Mass summing length*area below 30 is calced; approx total length ~ 11m and area average ~1 reduces mass > constraint.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths (approx): node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_4= sqrt((2.2-2)^2+(2.8-0)^2)=~2.8, node_3-node_6= sqrt((3.6-2)^2+(0.6)^2)=1.7, node_6-node_2= sqrt((6-3.6)^2+(0-0)^2)=2.4, node_6-node_5= sqrt((4.7-3.6)^2+(1.9-0.6)^2)=1.7, node_5-node_4= sqrt((4.7-2.2)^2+(1.9-2.8)^2)=2.6, node_5-node_2= sqrt((6-4.7)^2+(0-1.9)^2)=2.36, node_4-node_1= sqrt((0-2.2)^2+(0-2.8)^2)=3.55.
