  "preamble": "Refine node_4 vertical position and adjust areas to reduce max stress while staying within mass limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress member_5 near limit at 18.66, other members well below 20. Total mass 14.387 is low compared to max 30. To reduce max stress, likely better to change geometry than increase cross-sections.",
  "analysis": "Member_5 very close to allowable stress: 18.66 vs limit 20. This member connects node_2 (roller at 6,0) to node_4 (2,3.4). High stress may be due to sharp angles or load transfer from node_3. Node_4 was raised to 3.4 from 2.5 last iteration, increasing mass and stress. Previous lower was 2.5 with max stress 13.86. The load at node_3 is (-10, -45 deg) pushing down-left. To reduce member_5 stress, attempt reducing node_4 Y slightly (lower vertical displacement), which softens load path, reduce tensile stress. Avoid lowering too far to avoid stressing other members (like member_4). Change areas to effectively distribute stress. Node_1 and node_2 positions fixed due to supports, node_3 fixed (load)",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try node_4 at 3.0 instead of 3.4. Lowering Y reduces member_5 length and force, check member_3,4 stress impacts. Increase area of member_5 to next level if needed, while keeping total mass under 30 allowed.",
  "reasoning": "By adjusting node_4 y downward to 3.0 (from 3.4), member_5 length decreases reducing tensile stress. Small reduction won't affect support nodes nor load node_3. Replace member_5 area '1' (0.195 area) with '2' (0.782 area) to help handle stress while still giving total mass safety margin. Reduce area of member_3 slightly from 3 area (1.759) to 2 area (0.782) if stresses low to compensate mass. Member_1 increased slightly to area 4 (3.128) can help reduce its stress affecting load path.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4 vertical new proposed 3.0\nMember_5 area '2'\nMember_3 area '2'\nMember_1 area '4'\nMember_4 keep area '2'\nMember_2 keep area '1'\nAssuming reduction in length and area changes decrease max stress by approx 3-4, mass remains comfortably below 30.",
  "calculation": "Estimated length member_5 from (6,0) to (2,3.0) is sqrt(16+9)=5.0 approx\nPrevious length at y=3.4 was sqrt(16+11.56)= sqrt(27.56)=5.25\nReduction of length by 0.25 reduces force elongation and stress proportionally.\nIncreasing area from 0.195 to 0.782 increases capacity ~4 times, stress reduction ~75%, so max stress likely around (18.66 * 0.25) ~= 4.7. \nMember_3 area reduced from 1.759 to 0.782 reduces mass from ~6 to ~2.5. This shaves mass which compensates increased size member_5.\nMember_1 area from 1.759 to 3.128 increases mass from ~3.5 to ~6.2 помогает снизить стресс.\nMass check: member_5 5.0*0.782=3.91, member_3 3.8*0.782=2.97, member_1 2.4*3.128=7.5 approx(servings), sum remains < 30.\nStress will balance under 20.",
