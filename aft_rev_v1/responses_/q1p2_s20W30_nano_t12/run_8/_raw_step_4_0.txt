Member_2 low compressive stress (-1.5) with large area (index 3), inefficient. We can lower area in member_2 to reduce mass or shift node_4 to redistribute forces reducing stress in member_5. Moving node_4 is allowed, not nodes with loads or supports. Increase height spread of node_4 to reduce stress on members around load. Possibly reduce area of member_2 to lower mass while checking stress limits. Current design inclination: node_4 shifted slightly right/upside; maybe wider horizontal placement reduces stress concentration.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus is to reduce member_5 tensile stress. Possibly shift node_4 more left (toward node_2) or slightly upward to reduce tension. Also reduce large areas with low stress (member_2). Areas for each member currently: m1=3, m2=3, m3=2, m4=2, m5=1. Check if member_2 area=3 is excessive given its low stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_2 area 3 is large with low stress (-1.5). Reducing area to 1 or 2 may reduce mass and help decrease internal force distribution causing high stress on member_5. Moving node_4 up and slightly closer horizontally to node_2 may reduce tension in member_5. Also elongating member_3 and member_4 paths can redistribute forces. Aim to keep node_4 within reasonable x: 2 - 2.5, y: 3 to 3.6 range. Modified member area selections align with stress magnitude: higher stresses require higher area members for strength. Changing member_2 area to 1 (0.195) from 3 (1.759) reduces mass cost but must verify it won\'t increase stress beyond limits. Shifting node_4 to (2.0, 3.5) may stabilize force distribution better.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Equations: Stress = Force / Area. Max stress allowed 20.

Node positions: keep support/load nodes fixed. Move node_4 to (2.0, 3.5) to optimize force path.
