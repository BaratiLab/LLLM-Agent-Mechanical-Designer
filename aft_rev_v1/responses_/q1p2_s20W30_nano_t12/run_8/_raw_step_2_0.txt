Total mass 14.387 is low compared to max 30. To reduce max stress, likely better to change geometry than increase cross-sections.",\n  "analysis": "Member_5 very close to allowable stress: 18.66 vs limit 20. This member connects node_2 (roller at 6,0) to node_4 (2,3.4). High stress may be due to sharp angles or load transfer from node_3. Node_4 was raised to 3.4 from 2.5 last iteration, increasing mass and stress. Previous lower was 2.5 with max stress 13.86. The load at node_3 is (-10, -45 deg) pushing down-left. To reduce member_5 stress, attempt reducing node_4 Y slightly (lower vertical displacement), which softens load path, reduce tensile stress. Avoid lowering too far to avoid stressing other members (like member_4). Change areas to effectively distribute stress. Node_1 and node_2 positions fixed due to supports, node_3 fixed (load)",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try node_4 at 3.0 instead of 3.4. Lowering Y reduces member_5 length and force, check member_3,4 stress impacts. Increase area of member_5 to next level if needed, while keeping total mass under 30 allowed.",\n  "reasoning": "By adjusting node_4 y downward to 3.0 (from 3.4), member_5 length decreases reducing tensile stress. Small reduction won\'t affect support nodes nor load node_3. Replace member_5 area \'1\' (0.195 area) with \'2\' (0.782 area) to help handle stress while still giving total mass safety margin. Reduce area of member_3 slightly from 3 area (1.759) to 2 area (0.782) if stresses low to compensate mass.
