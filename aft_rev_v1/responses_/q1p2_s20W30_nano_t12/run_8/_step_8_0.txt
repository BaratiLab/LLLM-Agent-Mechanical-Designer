  "preamble": "Optimize node 4's position to reduce peak stress in concise closed 2D truss.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 18.36 < 20 allowed; total mass 10.5 < 30 allowed; node_4 moved drastically over iterations; stress concentrated at member_5 tension (18.36), member_2 compression (-13.81). Load at node_3 fixed; supports at nodes_1 (pinned), 2 (roller) fixed. Area assignments mostly minimal near high stress members; member_2 has smallest area leading to highest compression stress.",
  "analysis": "Max tensile stress is very close to limit, seen at member_5 (between node_2 and node_4) indicating tension on upper diagonal. Also largest compressive stress at member_2 (node_3 to node_2). To reduce max stress, try adjusting node_4 slightly and shift truss shape to better distribute forces. Slight reduction of height of node_4 or lateral shift to rebalance stress, possibly decreasing stress in member_5 and member_2. Areas reasonable given constraints, changing areas would increase mass which we should avoid. Reposition node_4 only due to instruction not to move loaded/support nodes. Member connectivity stays same for closed truss.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_5 is tensioned (18.36), lowering node_4 in vertical position or laterally toward node_2 could reduce tension on member_5. Also, increasing horizontal position of node_4 might reduce compressive force on member_2. Current node_4 at (2.8, 2.8): moving it closer to node_3 or node_2 will affect member lengths and forces. Aim to find position that lowers tension/compression max stress while keeping total mass under 30 and keeping structure stable.",
  "reasoning": "Given load at node_3 (-10 N at -45deg), force induced pulls node_4 via member_3 and member_5. Member_3 compression moderate around -9.4. The goal is a small shift of node_4 around (2.8,2.8) to ~(3.2,2.6 to 2.8) towards node_2 which may balance forces to reduce stress. Area IDs already optimized with low areas on member_2 and member_5. This should reduce member_2 compressive stress and member_5 tensile stress without mass penalty. Use floating point precision in node_4 adjustment.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Length calc approx:\nmember_5 length ~ distance(node_2[6,0], node_4[2.8,2.8]) ~ sqrt((3.2)^2 + (2.8)^2) = sqrt(10.24 + 7.84) ~ sqrt(18.08) ≈ 4.25\nIf node_4 moved (3.2, 2.6), member_5 length becomes ~ sqrt((2.8)^2 + 2.6^2)= sqrt(7.84+6.76)= sqrt(14.6) ≈ 3.82 shorter member_5 means less tension force.\nTry node_4: (3.2, 2.7) trade off length and force.\nRecalculate anticipated max stress ~ proportional to member length and force; reduce by length reduction.\nCheck vertical projection for equilibrium kept within truss force balance given fixed nodes and load.",
  "calculation": "Update node_4 to (3.22, 2.67) to reduce tension in member_5 and compression in member_2.\nKeep same member connections and member area. Expected approximate stress drop of ~10%. Total mass estimated to slightly decrease member lengths hence no mass penalty.\nMember mass recalculated given minor geometric changes: total mass still < 11, max stress expected under 18.\nRemove previous slightly oververtical 2.8 height leaving shorter compression members, possibly stabilizing stresses.\nTherefore: node_4 moved to (3.22, 2.67).",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Check all nodes fixed except node_4 moved. Areas unaltered. Members intact. Max stress < 20. Total mass ~ 10.5 < 30. No duplicate nodes members. Constraints satisfied. Further stress reduction likely minimal due to proximity to load/support bounds and geometry.\nWill continue in next iteration if stress reduction insufficient.",
