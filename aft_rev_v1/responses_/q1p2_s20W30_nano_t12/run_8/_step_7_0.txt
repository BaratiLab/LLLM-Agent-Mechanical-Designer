  "preamble": "Refine node_4 position to reduce max stress and maintain total mass below 30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: stress <= Â±20, mass <= 30; Existing max stress is 16.34, mass 11.35 with node_4 at (3.0, 3.3).",
  "analysis": "Node_4 movement affects stress distribution significantly; members at node_5 have highest stress (16.34 tensile). Lowering node_4 height stabilizes member_5 tension. Area IDs assigned already balanced for mass and stress. Load at node_3 fixed. Support nodes fixed.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Prior iterations increased node_4 height led to increased member_mass and mass; also caused stress peaks. A moderate decrease from y=3.3 to about 2.8 with height adjustment can lower stress on member_5 and modestly move stresses closer to balanced. Node_3 horizontal fixed at 2.0, node_1 and node_2 fixed too.",
  "reasoning": "By lowering node_4 along y-axis (keep x within [2.5, 3.0]) node lengths change: member_3, member_4, and member_5 length and orientation optimize stress paths. Using the same area assignments preserves mass within limit and leverages geometry for stress balance. Avoid large x offset to not induce strain on member_1 and member_3 which have moderate to high compressive stress in previous steps.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current member stresses: member_5 max tension at 16.34 close to limit; biggest issue. Aim to reduce member_5 tension by lowering node_4 y slightly. Check if member masses remain under total mass. Areas: member_1(3), member_3(2), member_4(2), member_5(1), member_2(1) which is minimal on highly stressed members 5 and 2.",
  "calculation": "Move node_4 x to 2.8, y to 2.8. Approximate member lengths recalculated, expect member_5 and member_3 tension compression reduced. Member_5 length ~ sqrt((6-2.8)^2 + (0-2.8)^2)= sqrt(3.2^2 + 2.8^2)= 4.26 approx; less than before lowering force and stress. Mass estimated less than 13 remains under limit.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Check if new geometry maintains statics with all nodes fixed except node_4, memberships consistent, total mass <=30, max stress <16 recommended as margin is maintained, structural integrity closed and optimized.",
