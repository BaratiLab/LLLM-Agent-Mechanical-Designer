  "preamble": "Optimize stress and mass within constraints by adjusting node_4 position and areas.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints max stress ±20 and mass ≤30 are currently met. Max stress at member_2 (-16.1164) close to limit. Scaling areas or repositioning can improve stress distribution. Node_3 and supports fixed.",
  "analysis": "Current max compressive stress is large in member_2, contributing to risk nearing limit. Member_1 with largest area has low stress (-3.2653). Member_3 has moderate compression. Mass under limit but can allow slight increase to lower stress. Node_4 vertical lowered from 3.4 to 3 improved max stress. Adjusting node_4's y-position slightly up, and shifting horizontal to stabilize force flow is promising. Also rebalancing member areas near stressed members is a sound strategy.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Aim: reduce member_2 stress by altering angle larger vertical component, redistributing forces from node_3 via node_4. Consider reducing area on low-stress member_1 to reduce mass and increasing area on member_2 from area 1 to area 3 (1.759) to increase capacity, while decreasing member_5 area, currently at 2 (0.782) to 1 (0.195).",
  "reasoning": "1. Node_4 can be moved slightly higher and slightly closer to node_2 to increase axial angle of member_2, reducing compression. 2. Decreasing member_1 area from 4(3.128) to 3(1.759) reduces unnecessary mass there. 3. Increasing member_2 area from 1(0.195) to 3(1.759) increases capacity, reducing stress. 4. Decreasing member_5 area from 2(0.782) to 1(0.195) balances mass. Checks on other members at moderate stress (member_3, member_4) justify area 2 and 2 respectively unchanged to avoid sudden stress spike. This balances overall stress with available mass budget. Movement constraints keep loads/support at nodes_1,2,3 fixed.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "From FEM results: member_2 at -16.12 max stress near ±20 limit; aim to reduce by ~20%. Node_4 vertical =3 moved towards x=2.4 results in shortening member_3 and member_4 slightly; changes force distribution favorably. Member_1 area decreased - mass saved ~2 units. Member_2 area increased from 1(0.195) to 3(1.759), expected stress reduction proportionally. Mass recalculation confirms total under 30.",
  "calculation": "Node_1(0,0), Node_2(6,0), Node_3(2,0) unchanged. For Node_4, best y set at 3.2 and x shifted from 2.0 to 2.4 to improve axial alignment reducing stress in member_2. Reassign areas: member_1=3, member_2=3, member_3=2, member_4=2, member_5=1. Compute member lengths: m1 2.5, m2 3.6, m3 approx 3.041, m4 approx 3.692, m5 approx 3.252 weights with respective areas fit well under max mass 30 (sum lengths*areas). Expected stress reduction primarily in member_2 with doubled area, and reduction in member_1 area cutting unnecessary mass. The new configuration is expected to balance compressive stress around 12-14 and tensile stressmax below limit.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Check constraints: max stress ≤±20 satisfied with expected improved distribution. Mass below 30 confirmed by sum(length*area). Node positions valid, no duplicates. Load and supports unchanged. Unique member connections maintained.",
