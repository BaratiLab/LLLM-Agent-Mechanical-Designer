Existing areas mostly 1 or 2 except member_2 at area \'1\' which is minimal. Node_4 repositioned over iterations in vertical and horizontal direction with trade-offs in stress and mass. Load is -10N at -45 degrees at node_3; supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The main stress sources are tensile large magnitude in members connected to node_3 and node_4. Members under compression (negative stress) are member_1 (-13.79) and member_2 (-12.45). Tensile max around 7.67 at member_4 is relatively high but safe. Mass is moderate. Keeping load/support nodes fixed, only node_3 and node_4 can be altered but node_3 is fixed at (2,0) per instructions. Node_4 currently at (2.6, 3.3). Member areas mostly small to moderate sized. Stress is within allowable limits but can be smoother. Closed structure is maintained with current connectivity of 5 members without additions. Focus on adjusting node_4 position slightly to balance tensile and compressive stress better to reduce max stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider slight lowering node_4 y-coordinate to reduce compressive stresses in member_1 and member_2 while not increasing tensile stresses excessively in member_4 and member_5. Slight lateral (x) shift can also be analyzed to better align load path. Also consider minor area adjustment for member_1 or member_3 to reduce stress peaks. Avoid significant mass increase.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "From history, increasing y-coordinate of node_4 led to higher stresses some iterations. Slight decrease toward 3.0-3.1 range with adjusted x=2.55 could reduce compression peaks at member_1 and member_2. Member_4 and member_5 already at area \'2\'; increasing beyond adds mass. Member_1 area at \'2\' is sufficient now but can be tried at \'3\' to see effect. Minor adjustments with small area increase for member_1 or 3 can smooth stress without high mass increase.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Original node_4=(2.6,3.3). Calculate approx member lengths: member_1 length = distance(node_1, node_3)=(2.0m), unchanged; member_3 length = distance(node_3,(2.6,3.3)) ~ sqrt( (0.6)^2+ (3.3)^2)=~3.36m. Member_4 length=distance(node_1,node_4) ~ sqrt((2.6)^2+(3.3)^2)=~4.2m, member_5 length=distance(node_2,node_4)= sqrt((3.4)^2+ (3.3)^2)~4.73m.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Lower node_4 y to 3.1, move x to 2.55. Keep member_1 at area \'3\' to reduce compressive stress (-13.791 -> ~10), hall same for member_3 area \'2\' stays, member_4 and member_5 area \'2\' unchanged aiming no mass rise >13. Total estimated mass ~(member_1 length * area_3=2.0*1.759=3.52)+(member_2 1*0.195*distance(2 to 6=4)=0.78)+(member_3 3.3*0.782=2.58)+(member_4 4.05*0.782=3.17)+(member_5 4.65*0.782=3.64)=~13.7 total mass, safe below 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Estimated max stress reduced below existing max of 13.79 by increasing area of compressed member_1 to \'3\' and repositioning node_4, stress balance smoother and mass under constraints.
