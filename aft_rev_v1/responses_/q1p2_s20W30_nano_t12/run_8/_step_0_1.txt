  "preamble": "Optimize a closed 2D truss minimizing stress and mass under given loads, supports, and constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes fixed at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0) with load (-10N, -45°) at node_3, supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Max stress ±20, max mass 30 units (sum length × area indices). Aim closed truss with minimal mass and stress.",
  
  "analysis": "Input nodes are colinear along x-axis at y=0, this is unstable in 2D for lateral load. To form a stable closed structure, we must add at least one node above or below existing line forming triangles for stability. This new node should help carry load at node_3 safely within stress limits using minimum material area. Members must connect nodes forming a closed polygon without redundancy. Load direction -45° implies tension/compression in members diagonally connected to node_3. Support system: node_1 pinned (fix both x, y), node_2 roller (fix only vertical or horizontal depending on direction assumed vertical typical).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "A common stable triangulation is a truss with one apex node vertically above node_3 to form two triangular cells. Set new node_4 above x=2 node_3 around positive y to better counter downward load component. Connect node_3 to node_4, node_4 to node_1 and node_2, also connect node_1-node_3 and node_2-node_3 to close polygon. This yields 5 members closing into 2 triangular panels. Select minimal cross-sectional areas to limit mass. Verify stress approx via static equilibrium by assuming axial forces transfer load without bending. Area chosen accordingly from sizes up to 10 (19.548) under stress limit ±20.",
  
  "reasoning": "Stress ~ Force / Area; to keep stress ≤ 20 and forces from static equilibrium, pick minimal area to maintain stress bounds. Areas in {1, 0.195, 0.782, 1.759, 3.128, ...} choose smaller unless force is larger. Use force equilibrium at node_3 and node_4 (new), to solve member axial forces approximately by decomposing loads. Use geometric lengths found via distance formula to calculate member mass length×area. Assume axial forces only in members. Members cross connected to create rigidity prevent excessive compression or tension beyond 20. The new node position balances vertical components better to reduce overturning.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4 y position estimated by equalizing axial force components given load magnitude and directions to distribute forces and limiting member length to save mass. Member length calc: d = sqrt((x2−x1)^2 + (y2−y1)^2). Area selects based on F/StressMax to minimize area~Force/20. Compressive and tensile force analysis approximate from trigonometric projections of load at node_3 along member directions. Calculate sum mass = Σ(length×area). Ensure no overlapped members nor disconnected node.",
