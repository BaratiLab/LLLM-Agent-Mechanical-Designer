  "preamble": "Current 4-node, 5-member truss satisfies constraints; stress is well under limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives: minimize max stress ≤ ±20, max mass ≤ 30. Load on node_3; supports on node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Node_3 and ends fixed; only node_4 position can vary.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is 15.27 < 20, total mass 11.1 < 30. Current member areas mostly '1' and '2' categories; stress uniform and adequately distributed. Node_4 moved closer inward and down from prior iterations to optimize stress.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "History shows increasing height from 2.8 to ~3.5 increased stress near limit; reducing node_4 to (2.4,2.85) reduced max stress to 15.27. Larger member areas cause mass increases; smaller areas cause stress limit violation.",
  
  "reasoning": "Further moving node_4 downward reduces member_3 compressive stress near 9.13 and helps ring stress distribution. Choosing moderate member areas balances mass and stress. Adding nodes or members not allowed; only node move permissible (node_4). Current location reasonably optimized.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Area selections: member_1&3&4&5 are area '2' (0.782), member_2 is area '1' (0.195). Stresses mostly balanced with max compressive ~-15.3, tensile ~7.9. Margins to constraints remain; mass far below 30 limit enabling safe buffer.",
  
  "calculation": "Node_4 at (2.4, 2.85) analyzed: member lengths moderate, areas moderate, stresses well controlled. Shifting node_4 slightly tends to increase either max stress or mass. Current design an effective trade-off.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "No further improvement likely by node move without violating constraints or increasing mass. History confirms incremental changes tried and this state appears near-optimal.",
