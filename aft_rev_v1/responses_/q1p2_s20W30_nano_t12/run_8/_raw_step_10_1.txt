Load at node_3 (-10N, 45° down-left). Current max stress marginally exceeds constraints on member_5 (~20.29). History shows prior vertical node_4 locations from ~2.3 to 4.0; introducing denser truss with minimal increase in nodes may improve force distribution.",\n  "analysis": "Current structure: 4 nodes with node_3 load, nodes 1 and 2 supported pinned and roller, node_4 elevated at (2.9,2.3). Member_5 highly stressed at 20.29 (limit 20). Load direction causes compression on some members and high tension on member_5. Reducing stress on member_5 to just under 20 and balancing other members is key. Total mass 9.876 under limit. Possible improvement: lower node_4 slightly, add one new node between nodes 2 and 4 to redistribute load. Also increasing area of member_5 from \'1\'(0.195) to \'2\'(0.782) to reduce stress, balanced with lowering mass by lowering member_1 and member_4 area from \'3\' to \'2\'.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding an additional node near node_4 towards node_2 to alleviate stress on member_5? Possibly place node_5 at (4.3, 1.8). Connect node_5 to node_2 and node_4, redistribute load paths and optimize member areas with priority to reduce member_5 stress while keeping mass low. Move node_4 slightly lower to provide better geometry.",\n  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (4.3,1.8). Move node_4 to (2.7,2.5). Connect extra members: node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2. Use areas: member_5 (\'2\'), member_3 (\'2\'), member_4 (\'2\'), member_1 (\'2\'), member_2 (\'1\'), new members use nominal area \'1\' or \'2\' based on stress estimate. This will shown force redistribution reducing stress in member_5 while maintaining mass safely below 30.",\n  "reasoning": "Adding intermediate node allows better stiffness footing near node_2 reducing stress on final member_5. Lowering node_4\'s height reduces elongation/tension on members connected to top node. Choosing areas balancing mass-stress relations on critical members keeps max stresses within ±20 and ensures total mass remains below 30. Distributing load paths prevents stress concentration. Existing member connections retained but supplemented with new members forming triangles for improved structural integrity.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: member_5(2.7 to 6.0,0) ~√((3.3)^2+2.5^2)=~4.15, area \'2\'=0.782. Other new members length ~1.5-2.5 units each. Mass roughly under 20. Prior large areas on heavier members went up to 3+ mass, total under 10 currently, so adding node and members with controlled areas still under 30 possible. Stress reduced on member_5 since force path shortened by node_5. Lower node_4 reduces bending moment. Consider triangle geometry to reduce member lengths for new members here.",\n  "calculation": "Node positions: node_4: (2.7, 2.5), node_5: (4.3, 1.8). Members: member_1: node_1-node_3 area \'2\' (0.782); member_2: node_3-node_2 area \'1\' (0.195); member_3: node_3-node_4 area \'2\' (0.782); member_4: node_1-node_4 area \'2\' (0.782); member_5: node_2-node_4 area \'2\' (0.782); member_6: node_4-node_5 area \'1\'(0.195); member_7: node_5-node_2 area \'1\'(0.195). Lengths approx member_5 ~ 4.15, member_6 ~ 1.97, member_7 ~ 2.06; masses will sum below 30 considering area multipliers and lengths. Stress expected: load paths reduced on member_5, max stresses decrease to <=20; others well below limit due to increased path count. This updates mass and stress to be compliant.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Final check: node_1,pinned, node_2 roller unchanged. node_3 load unchanged.
