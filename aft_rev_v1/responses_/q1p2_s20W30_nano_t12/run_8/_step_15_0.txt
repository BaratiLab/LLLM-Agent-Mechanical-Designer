  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to reduce max stress while respecting constraints on stress and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current structure nodes fixed at supports & load. Max stress well below ±20 with total mass ~16.7 < 30. Aim: marginally reduce max stress further by subtle nodal repositioning and possibly refined area choices.",
  
  "analysis": "Members under compressive stress exceed -13 (member_1) and tensile stresses are moderate. Current mass margins are comfortable. 'node_4' at (2.8,3.5) might be optimized to reduce bending in member_4 (node_4 to node_1) which is large at area 3 (7.8842 mass) but stress is low (3.432). Member 1 and 3 with area 2 have the most compressive stress, suggesting geometrical changes can redistribute forces. Load nodal locations can't change.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Small shift of node_4 vertically or horizontally can balance stresses in members 1,3,4,5. Consider reducing area of member_4 while slightly lowering node_4 to reduce lever arm forces. Member 1 could stay at area 2. Member 5 and 2 are low stress, member 5 with area 2 (moderate cross-section).",
  
  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 slightly left or downward should reduce high axial compressive force on member_1 and member_3, lowering max stress. Reducing area of member 4 from 3 to 2 can drop mass significantly if stress remains within limit. Maintain member connectivity to preserve closed loop structure. Member area combos must maintain stress within ±20 and total mass under 30. Area choice from {0:1, 1:0.195, 2:0.782, 3:1.759, ...} different dimension units considered, find optimized balance.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and angles based on node_4 at new position. Cross product and geometry lend to compute member lengths for mass. Areas chosen to ensure compressive stresses limited. Area adjustments must comply with results from previous iterations and known stress shifts.",
  
  "calculation": "Move node_4 from (2.8, 3.5) to (2.6, 3.3). Slight left and down reduces cantilever effects on member_4 and balances forces on members 1 and 3. Area for member_4 changed from '3' to '2' reducing its mass from 7.8842 to estimated ~3.5. Maintain other areas. Estimated mass reduces overall. Max compressive stress should reduce into ~12-13 range if force flow redistributes favorably. Member lengths approximate: m4~3.5; m1,3 closer length ~similar, keeps mass and stress in safe envelope.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved slightly left and down (2.6, 3.3); member_4 area lowered to '2' from '3'. Maintain member_1,3 areas at '2'. Members 2,5 remain area 1 and 2. Recalculate assumed stresses kept under limits. Total mass expected ~13-14 which is acceptable. Load and support node positions unchanged. Structure remains closed loop without duplicates.",
