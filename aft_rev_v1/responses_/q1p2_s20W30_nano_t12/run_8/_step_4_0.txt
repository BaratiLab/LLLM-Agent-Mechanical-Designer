  "preamble": "Optimize structure to minimize max stress, stay within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 18.19 near limit 20, mass 17.14 < 30. Members mostly in allowable stress range. Node_4 moved from 3.0 to 3.2 height and x 2.0 to 2.4, increasing mass.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_5 has highest tensile stress 18.19, near limit. Member_2 low compressive stress (-1.5) with large area (index 3), inefficient. We can lower area in member_2 to reduce mass or shift node_4 to redistribute forces reducing stress in member_5. Moving node_4 is allowed, not nodes with loads or supports. Increase height spread of node_4 to reduce stress on members around load. Possibly reduce area of member_2 to lower mass while checking stress limits. Current design inclination: node_4 shifted slightly right/upside; maybe wider horizontal placement reduces stress concentration.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus is to reduce member_5 tensile stress. Possibly shift node_4 more left (toward node_2) or slightly upward to reduce tension. Also reduce large areas with low stress (member_2). Areas for each member currently: m1=3, m2=3, m3=2, m4=2, m5=1. Check if member_2 area=3 is excessive given its low stress.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_2 area 3 is large with low stress (-1.5). Reducing area to 1 or 2 may reduce mass and help decrease internal force distribution causing high stress on member_5. Moving node_4 up and slightly closer horizontally to node_2 may reduce tension in member_5. Also elongating member_3 and member_4 paths can redistribute forces. Aim to keep node_4 within reasonable x: 2 - 2.5, y: 3 to 3.6 range. Modified member area selections align with stress magnitude: higher stresses require higher area members for strength. Changing member_2 area to 1 (0.195) from 3 (1.759) reduces mass cost but must verify it won't increase stress beyond limits. Shifting node_4 to (2.0, 3.5) may stabilize force distribution better.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Equations: Stress = Force / Area. Max stress allowed 20. To reduce stress in m5 (tensile 18.19 at area 1), consider shifting node_4 closer to node_2 to reduce force on m5, or redistribute areas. Node_4 current 2.4,3.2 â†’ proposal 2.0,3.5. Members and lengths approx: m1(1-3): length 2.0, m2(3-2): length ~4.0, m3(3-4): length ~3.5, m4(1-4): length ~3.9, m5(2-4): length ~3.6. Area mapping '1' =0.195, '2' = 0.782, '3' =1.759. Evaluate stress in member_5 by lowering force component via geometry and possibly increase m5 area if safe.",
  
  "calculation": "Reselect member areas: member_1: 3 (area=1.759) for compressive forces; member_2: reduce from 3 to 1 (area=0.195) to cut mass from 7.036 to about 0.78; member_3 and member_4 keep 2(0.782); member_5 keep area_id=1 (0.195) to cautiously reduce mass. Node positions: keep support/load nodes fixed. Move node_4 to (2.0, 3.5) to optimize force path. This expects reducing member_5 tensile force due to geometry, and mass reduction from member_2 area change will improve total mass close to ~14-15, max stress expected to slightly reduce under 18 with improved geometry.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node moves allowed only for node_4; areas set to reduce mass intelligently and try to relieve highest stress in member_5 decreasing it. Areas consistent with allowable stress. Total mass should remain below 30, stress under 20. Recommendation is not to stop optimization yet, as further minor tuning may be possible.",
