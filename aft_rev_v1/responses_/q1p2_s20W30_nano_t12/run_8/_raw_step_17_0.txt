Areas from given set.",\n  "analysis": "Current max compressive stress at member_2 (-13.452) close to limit but acceptable. Max tensile stress at member_4 (7.8056) moderate. Some stress imbalance noted between longer members. Mass well below max 30, so potential for lamina area reduction or shape adjustment to smooth stress. Prices of increase or decrease of member areas needed carefully. Node_4 can move between x~2.55 & y~3.1, varying to optimize force equilibrium and stress. Members subject to both tension and compression revealing current geometry suboptimal for uniform force flow.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Potential adjustment strategy: Move node_4 slightly down and left to engage different force path and bar length. Tune member areas leading to balanced stresses near mid-range (~13) compression/tension range while lowering max. Areas tentatively can be reduced on over-designed members like member_1 (area_3=1.759). Increasing in areas benefits heavily loaded compressive member_2 (area_1=0.195) but must not exceed stress limit. Current structure satisfactory mass-wise but optimization guided to harmonize stresses and reduce peak.",\n  "reasoning": "To minimize max stress, improve geometry by moving node_4 closer to horizontal mid-level around (2.4, 2.85)new tentative coordinates keeps closed truss and shift force direction to reduce max compression in member_2. Keep areas same or moderately reduce member_1 to area_2 (0.782) which will marginally raise stress in that member but optimize overall distribution. Members in tension (member_4 and member_5) retained area_2 to control stress. Effectively better balances layout to minimize peak.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Estimations: Node_4 move from (2.55,3.1) to (2.4,2.85). Change area member_1 from 3 to 2 (1.759→0.782).
