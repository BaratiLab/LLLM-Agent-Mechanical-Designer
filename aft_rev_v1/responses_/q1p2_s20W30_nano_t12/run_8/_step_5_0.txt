  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress ~18.36 close to limit 20, total mass ~11.2 well under limit 30. Node_4 at (2, 3.5). Load applied at node_3 fixed horizontal nodes. Areas mostly small or medium. Objective is to reduce stress by adjusting node_4 vertically or horizontally, connections fixed.",
  
  "analysis": "max tensile stress in member_5 (node_2-node_4) near max allowed (18.3557) and max compressive in member_2 (-13.8141). Member_5 uses area 1 (0.195 m^2) and member_2 area 1 too. To reduce member_5 stress, reposition node_4 higher or to right to relieve load path. Enlarging area for member_5 violates mass consideration since current total reasonable, better reposition node_4 for force distribution. Node_3 and supports fixed per input. Choose node_4 new coordinate to optimize stress balance.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress in member_5 high tensile whereas members connecting at node_4 may redistribute forces by changing node_4 coord. Keep node_4 y > 3.5 and x between 2 and 3. Solve approx location. Guess node_4 at (2.6, 4.0). Check new member lengths and areas.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_5 (node_2:(6,0) to node_4:(2.6,4.0)) length ~ sqrt((6-2.6)^2 + (0-4)^2) = sqrt(11.56 +16) = sqrt(27.56) ~5.25. Previously, length ~5.147 (at (2,3.5)). Slight increase in length decreases stress by increasing section or reducing force concentration. Member areas unchanged to keep mass low (member_5 area='1'). Possibly enlarge member_2 area from '1' to '2' to reduce stress (-13.8 to less), but mass grows moderately. Focus first on geometry change. If required then increase member areas next iter.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Coord node_4 = (2.6,4.0)\nLength calculations for members at node_4:\nmember_3 len: node_3-(2,0) to node_4-(2.6,4.0): sqrt(0.6^2 + 4^2)=4.044\nmember_4 len: node_1-(0,0) to node_4-(2.6,4.0)= sqrt(2.6^2+4^2)=4.83\nmember_5 as above 5.25\nMass roughly sum lengths * areas\nCheck total mass remains under 30.\nArea: member_1=3(1.759), member_2=1(0.195), member_3=2(0.782), member_4=2(0.782), member_5=1(0.195).\nEstimate total mass: member_1 length ~2; mass~3.5\nmember_2 length ~4; mass ~0.78\nmember_3 length ~4; mass ~3.1\nmember_4 length ~4.8; mass ~3.7\nmember_5 length ~5.25; mass ~1.0\nSum ~rougly 12-14 <30 meets constraints.\nStress expected to redistribute reducing max in member_5.",
  
  "calculation": "Shift node_4 from (2.0, 3.5) to (2.6, 4.0) to reduce stress concentration in member_5 and member_2 by altering geometry.\nKeep areas same as iteration_4 to not increase mass substantially.\nExpected max stress reduces from 18.36 to <18 by better force distribution.\nMass increase negligible, stays well below 30.\nConfirm member connections same, no duplication.\nLoad and support nodes fixed per instruction.\nConclude next iteration with node_4 repositioned.\nStop criteria not met - stress >0 not yet minimum, further refinement possible.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 reposition optimal for stress relief while meeting constraints.\nAreas kept constant to control mass.\nStop=False to proceed improvements in further iterations if needed.",
