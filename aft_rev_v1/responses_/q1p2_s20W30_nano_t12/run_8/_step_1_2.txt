  "preamble": "Optimizing node_4 position and member areas to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective to reduce max stress below 13.86 and keep total mass < 30, using given node/support/load constraints.",
  
  "analysis": "Loads create tension/compression mainly in members connected to node_3 and node_4. Max stress is in member_1 at -13.86, close to limit ±20. Mass is low (12.8 < 30). Node_4 vertical position affects stress in upper truss members; moving node_4 upwards may reduce stress. Member areas currently uniformly '2' (0.782 area). Increasing areas for lower stress members or decreasing area for under-utilized members can optimize stress and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Current max compressive in member_1 at -13.86; members_4 and 5 under less stress. Adjust node_4 vertically from 2.5 to ~3.3-3.5 to balance moments and reduce peak stress. Possibly reduce area of member_2 and 5 to lower mass, increase area in members more stressed like member_1 and 3.",
  
  "reasoning": "Constraint max stress ±20 is not exceeded; to reduce max stress we must improve geometry mainly by increasing triangular height to reduce compression force in member_1. Keep nodes for load/support fixed (nodes 1,2 & 3 stay at x=0, x=6 and node_3 x=2, y=0). Move node_4 up from y=2.5 to approx y=3.4 for improved load path and balanced force. Modulate cross-sectional areas, e.g., member_1 and 3 area to 3 (1.759) from 2 (0.782) to reduce stress; members minimally stressed can have reduced area to save weight. Structure remains closed quadrilateral pyramid-like truss. Preferred area selections to keep mass under 30.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Length(member_1) ~ sqrt((2-0)^2 + (3.4-0)^2)=sqrt(4 + 11.56)=~3.85; Area=1.759; Mass ~ length * area. Total mass still <30 with moderate area increases. Expected reduced axial force and stress with node_4 higher.",
  
  "calculation": "Moved node_4 y from 2.5 to 3.4; Area assignment: member_1=3 (1.759), member_2=1 (0.195), member_3=3 (1.759), member_4=2 (0.782), member_5=1 (0.195). Estimated mass <30, max stress < previous 13.86. Load remains at node_3, supports fixed, minimizing stress by improved force distribution due to node height adjustments and area redeployment.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Final node_4 position y=3.4, x unchanged. Areas adjusted to redistribute forces. Member count and connections unchanged. This should reduce peak stress and keep mass well under threshold making further iterative reduction unnecessary.",
