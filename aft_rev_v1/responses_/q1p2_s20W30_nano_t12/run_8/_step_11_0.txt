  "preamble": "Current iteration has effective stress within limits; refining node_4 and node_5 positions for stress equalization and mass efficiency.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress at 15.96 < 20 limit; total mass 11.31 < 30 kg. Members 6 and 7 have zero stress, suggesting potential redundancy or area oversizing. Load at node_3 fixed. node_1 and node_2 are fixed supports.",
  
  "analysis": "The addition of node_5 enabled a more statically determinate structure, improving stress distribution but members 6 and 7 currently bear no load. By optimizing node_4 and node_5 placement slightly, we can reduce compressive stresses in members 1 and 2 and minimize max stress and mass simultaneously.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on node_4 lowering and shifting slightly right, node_5 shifting towards node_2 to better align load paths. Reduce member 1 area from 2 to 1 due to lower stress, adjust member 3 and 4 areas accordingly. Members 6 and 7 seem needed for triangulation but can be reduced area wise if no stress.",
  
  "reasoning": "Max compressive stresses in members 1 and 2 (~-15.55, -15.95) near limit (20). Lowering node_4 will slacken compression and avoid peak tensile in member 4. Moving node_5 closer to node_2 will engage members 6 and 7 more effectively, reducing null stresses. Reducing thickness of high-area members with lower stress allows mass decrease, maintaining stresses below limit. Load in member_5 was 4.99; we can fine tune its area accordingly.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member 1 length ≈ dist(node_1, node_3)=2.0, area 2(0.782). If stress reduces, area=1(0.195) saves mass. Member 2 length ≈4.0, area 1 ok. Member 5 length ≈2.5 (between node_2 and node_4), area=2 could be lowered if stress decreased. Members 6 and 7 could drop to area=0 or approach zero if load paths allow.",
  
  "calculation": "Propose node_4 from (2.7, 2.5) to (2.9, 2.2) to reduce bending stresses. Move node_5 from (4.3, 1.8) slightly towards (4.5, 1.6) to transfer load efficiently. Change member areas: member_1 from '2'(0.782) to '1'(0.195), member_3 keep '2'(0.782), member_5 from '2' to '1', members_6 and 7 reduce from '1'(0.195) to area '0'(1) not ideal (outside options). Instead keep area '1' but check stresses post redesign. With node adjustments and area modifications, estimated mass reduces to ~9.8-10.5 and stresses near 14-16.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Validate no node movements on node_1,2,3. node_4 and node_5 moved slightly. Members remain unique, closed 2D truss geometry preserved. Mass expected within 30 limit and max stresses within 20. Stop optimization if next iteration no significant reduction.",
