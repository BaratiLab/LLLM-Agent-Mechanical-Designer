  "preamble": "Optimize truss node 4 position to minimize stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 17.45 < 20 limit; total mass 10.6163 < 30 limit. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Adjust node_4 position only to reduce max stress toward neutralizing peak member_5 stress ~17.45.",
  "analysis": "Member_5 at tensile 17.45 near max allowed stress; mass is low allowing some geometry change. Members connecting to node_4 have moderate stress, member_3 compressive roughly -9.94, showing member_5 most critical. Moving node_4 slightly lower and left from current (3.22, 2.67) may reduce stress in member_5 by geometry adjustment.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Tradeoff: lowering node_4 reduces member_5 axial stiffening, potentially lowering stress; however, lowering too much might increase displacement and stress in other members. Increase from previous trend to higher y led to higher stresses.",
  "reasoning": "Decreasing vertical height of node_4 closer to line between node_1 and node_2 keeps structure stiff but may reduce member_5 stress. Slight left and downward movement from (3.22, 2.67) and possibly slight increase in member_4 area could further balance loads. Keep area assignments same to avoid mass increase. Optimizing geometry can reduce peak stress under current areas.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Evaluate member length/mass tradeoff: Length_member_5 is from (6, 0) to node_4. Moving node_4 lower and left reduces length_mem5, reduce cross-sectional stress. Max member_5 tensile before was 17.45, reduce it to <16 by approximately shifting node_4 position toward about (2.9, 2.3).",
  "calculation": "Set node_4 new position to (2.9, 2.3), closer to previous values but lower and left. Mass estimation: mostly unchanged. Re-estimated member lengths and stress: expect member_5 stress drops by about 5% allowing balanced stress, max stress remains roughly <=17 but <18 now, total mass around 10.6 unchanged.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New node position keeps load and supports fixed; member connectivity unchanged; maintains closed truss; stresses expected improved. Areas fixed as per previous iteration; ensure mass < 30 and stress < 20. Stopping conditions not met as peak stress can be potentially improved further by refinement in future iterations.",
