Max member stress ±20, total mass ≤30 needed. Current max stress large at member_1 compression -68.1 exceeding ±20, requires design change.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure ineffective because high compressive stress on member_1. Member_1 cross-section area reduced to 0.195 (min), but stress too high, indicating member_1 too long or poorly oriented. Nodes node_4 and node_5 attempt to carry load but insufficiently optimized. Current members mostly small areas or area=1 corresponds to 0.195 identified threshold yet stress 68 is well above 20. Mass low (7.37) so can increase member size or add members/nodes.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Goal: Lower compression in member_1 by redistributing force, introduce bracing nodes to split load path. Include diagonal members to reduce bending effects. Keep support node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), load node_3 at (2,0). Node_4 and 5 placement needs improvement, possibly add a new node higher to transfer load vector aligned with force direction better.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Maintain nodes 1, 2, 3 as is, relocate node_4 higher and move node_5 closer to node_2 to reduce large members. Add new node_6 near (3.5,3.5) for triangular bracing. Use members (1-3), (3-2), (3-6), (1-6), (6-2), (6-4), (4-5), (5-2) but add fewer members with larger sections to reduce stress and mass. Increase areas where stress >20 to at least area_id=4 (3.128) or 5 (4.887). After finding layout, calculate lengths to mass estimate.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Reducing axial load on member_1 requires adding node_6 to transfer compression forces away from member_1. Use truss stability with triangles. Increase member area where stresses high to reduce stress. Bigger members cost mass but are allowed (max mass 30). Target member_1 area 5 for compression reduction. Support nodes fixed; node_4 moved slightly up for better load path; node_5 moved/fixed close to node_2 to reduce length of tension members. Number all members uniquely with no duplicates.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths from node coordinates: Use Euclidean norm. Total mass = Σ length × area_factor.

Members: member_1 (node_1-node_3-area 5:4.887), member_2 (node_3-node_2-area 3:1.759), member_3(node_3-node_6-area 4:3.128), member_4(node_1-node_6-area 4:3.128), member_5(node_6-node_2-area 3:1.759), member_6(node_6-node_4-area 1:0.195), member_7(node_4-node_5-area 1:0.195), member_8(node_5-node_2-area 1:0.195).
