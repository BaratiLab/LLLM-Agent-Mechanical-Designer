  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under given loads and supports with mass and stress constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: Max |stress| ≤ 20, total mass ≤ 30. Load at node_3, supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current design too heavy (52.8) but stresses low. Need a truss with less mass and still handle load efficiently.",
  
  "analysis": "Current structure is heavily overbuilt (mass ~52.8 vs max 30) with medium stress (~2.46 < 20). Members are oversized; smaller cross-section needed. Geometry complex with many members. Load at node_3 near base and mainly downward-left at 45°. Support nodes fixed, so no node movement there. Some members show zero stress, indicating redundancy. Structure can be simplified to a classical triangular bracing with minimal nodes for stability and load path efficiency, to reduce member length sums and area demand.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce node count and members while keeping stable triangulation. Retain node_3 at (2,0) with load, and move intermediate nodes closer to create shorter members. Minimal secondary nodes (1 or 2) between supports and load node. Use graded areas respecting stresses to minimize mass. Avoid multiple zero stress members by simplifying structure.",

  "proposal": "Retain nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0). Add one node_4 suitably elevated to support compression/tension paths. Members: node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_1, node_4-node_2. Use areas from smaller cross sections matching estimated stress and reduce mass. Node_4 vertically up above node_3 about y=3.5 for good triangulation.",
  
  "reasoning": "Triangular truss is statically determinate, distributes load via axial tension/compression. One elevated node sufficient to carry vertical load component from node_3, transferring compression/tension via diagonal members to supports. Reducing members reduces mass and improves stress distribution efficiency. Assign cross sections based on length and anticipated axial force (~max stress =20). Avoid large cross-section '5' to save mass; use smaller beyond '2'. Expected member lengths: ≤6 for base, ~3–4 for diagonal members; area depend on force.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2, node_3-node_2=4, node_3-node_4 vertical distance ~3.5, node_4-node_1 approx sqrt(3.5²+2²)=4.03, node_4-node_2 approx sqrt(3.5²+4²)=5.315. Cross check total mass = Σ length × area. Stress max allowed is 20. Area choices from 0 to 10 = [1,0.195,0.782,1.759,3.128,4.887,7.037,9.578,12.511,15.834,19.548], lower areas in small members preferred.",

  "calculation": "Estimate forces using static equilibrium for the applied load (-10, -45°) at node_3. Approximate force components at members near node_3 to pick area judiciously for stress ≤20. Assign smaller area on short members with tension, larger area for same length compression if critical. Calculate total mass ∑ length × area ≤30. Example assignments: node_1-node_3 area '2'=0.782, node_3-node_2 area '1'=0.195, node_3-node_4 area '2'=0.782, node_4-node_1 area '1'=0.195, node_4-node_2 area '0'=1. This keeps mass manageable.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no zero stress members, minimal members with proper triangulation. Total mass ~2 × 0.782 (node_3-node_4, node_1-node_3)=1.56 + 5.316 × 1 (area '0')=5.316 + 2 edges at lower area ~ <30 mass limit confirmed. Max stress estimated ≤20 by assigned cross-section. Supports pinned and roller fixed. Nodes not moved except new node_4 placement. No duplication.",
