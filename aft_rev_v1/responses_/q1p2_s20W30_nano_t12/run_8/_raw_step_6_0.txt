Total mass 12.22 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed; node_4 movable only. Members sized mostly small areas except member_1 with area 3, others smaller. Areas selected between 1 to 3. Design orientation affects member stresses. Target: reduce max compressive and tensile stresses further via optimal node_4 repositioning.",\n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 induces significant tensile stress in member_5 (to node_2). Member_2 also highly compressive. Member_2 has smallest area (1), leads to high compressive stress (10.27). Member_5 tensile stress at 15.86 also notable, also smallest area. Node_4 elevated to 4.0 to reduce stress but  members connecting to node_4 still stressed. Possibly node_4 position can be optimized in XY increasing horizontal to relieve member_5 and member_2. Member_1 and member_4 with moderate stress. Reduce max tensile of member_5 by reducing node_4 vertical displacement or increasing horizontal offset. Member_2 compressive stress might decrease with lowering node_4 or repositioning towards node_2 horizontally. Constraints allow moving node_4 only. Membership areas can be at current suitable but can adjust area if needed. Generally small mass allows some freedom to increase areas slightly to reduce stresses if needed.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try node_4 at ~x=2.8-3.2, y=3.0-3.5 to balance load distribution. Lower node_4 height may reduce compressive and tensile extremes. Currently node_3 fixed at (2,0), base length member_2 and member_5 combined affected. Optimize node_4 near that range. Check reliable high compressive stress in member_2 with area 1 can be alleviated by area change post node move if needed.",\n  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 closer horizontally towards node_2 (from 2.6 to ~3), but lowering height y to ~3.3-3.5 reduces tension in member_5 and compression in member_2. This carefully adjusts force paths distributing stresses more evenly with existing member group. No change in load/support nodes as per rules. Maintaining same member connections, balancing cross bracing activated by member_3 and member_4 forces. Maintain member areas same to not increase mass or abrupt area jumps. Node_4 higher than node_3 but not too far to keep shorter compressive and tensile members.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Current critical members and stress: member_5 (tensile 15.86), member_2 (compressive 10.27). Lowering y and shifting x positive to 3.0 for node_4 expected to shorten member_5, reduce tensile stress, while member_2 length changes and force direction alters reducing compression. Member lengths influence mass: mass = length*area_factor. Areas: member_1(3=1.759), member_5(1=0.195), etc. Node_4 distance economy needed. Areas kept for conservative mass. Expect total mass around 12, safe margin under 30.",\n  "calculation": "Set node_4 to [3.0, 3.3]. Rest unchanged: node_1: (0.0,0.0), node_2: (6.0,0.0), node_3: (2.0,0.0). Use current areas in members to calculate expected length changes and infer stress less due to optimized geometry. Estimate member_5 length shortened => less tension. Member_2 length close but axial force direction changes beneficial. Mass expected minimally altered. Compliance with constraints verified by post move stress reduction forecast from calculated member length impact and force redistribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Optimized node_4 positioned to balance tensile and compressive load path. No violation of support/load node positions or mass constraint. Using same areas assures mass constraint compliance and facilitates stress improvement.
