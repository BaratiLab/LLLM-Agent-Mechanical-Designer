Goal: closed truss means all nodes interconnected forming at least one loop. Max stress ±20 and mass ≤30 considering cross-section areas from catalog. No node position change except possibly adding new nodes. But instructions say to not change existing nodes; No added nodes mentioned, so must work with only given nodes. There are 3 nodes now; a closed truss with only 3 nodes implies a triangular shape connecting all three nodes.",\n    \n    "analysis": "With 3 nodes (0,0), (6,0), and (2,0) colinear (node_3 is between node_1 and node_2 on x-axis), these 3 points are collinear which cannot form a closed triangular truss. We must form a closed shape; must add a node off the line at a precise position to close the truss. The instruction forbids changing given nodes positions but doesn\'t forbid adding additional nodes. To form a closed truss with these supports and load, add an extra node above the x-axis to form a triangle to resist load efficiently.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2.5, y) with y > 0 to form a strong triangle with all nodes connected.

Keep y small to minimize mass (member length). Also analyze stress in members using simple equilibrium assumptions and truss method. Area choices selected trying smallest areas that keep stress ≤20.
