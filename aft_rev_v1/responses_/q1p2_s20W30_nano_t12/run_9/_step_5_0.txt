  "preamble": "Current 4-node truss meets constraints with good stress distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective is stress minimization within ±20 limit and mass ≤30, keeping load/support nodes fixed.",
  "analysis": "Current max stress is 9.17, well lower than ±20. Total mass 20.76 below 30. All members have moderate stresses without hot spots. Node_4 returned to 3.0 height tends to reduce stress in biggest stressed member (member_6). Members use areas 1, 2, 3 which align well with load demands. No violations in stress or mass.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Given improvement converged in last step; neither reducing node_4 height nor altering members reduced max_stress or mass notably. Load and support nodes fixed, limiting geometry change options. More members or nodes would contradict instructions.",
  "reasoning": "Stress minimized around 9.17 well within constraints, total mass comfortable. Further stress reduction may require area reduction, but smallest areas (1=0.195) already used for largest members permissible by constraints. Moving node_4 might increase stresses in compression members due to geometry change. Current design is balanced and closed 2D truss with no duplicates.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Key constraints: max stress ±20, total mass ≤30. Members with highest stress are near 9.17 < 20. Total mass is 20.76 < 30. Areas: 3(1.759), 2(0.782), 1(0.195) prioritized along members with higher stress to control mass and strength.",
  "calculation": "Member lengths remain roughly constant due to node positioning. Reduction in max stress from iteration_2 to iteration_4 by adjusting node_4's position confirms approach converges. Total mass stable around 20.7. No member area needs increase to reduce stress. Lowering area would increase stress, breaking constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Current design satisfies constraints, low max stress and mass well below limits, and minimal realistic node repositioning options left. Reinforced by stable trends in historic iterations.",
