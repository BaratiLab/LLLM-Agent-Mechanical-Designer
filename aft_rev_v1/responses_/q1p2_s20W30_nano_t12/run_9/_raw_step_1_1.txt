Stress is primary failure mode, optimize member areas and geometry for stress reduction and better force flow.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load at node_3 downward-left creates high tensile in bottom members near it. Current bottom chord members (1,2) have area 1 (0.195) causing high stress, reduce stress by re-distributing geometry and increasing critical member area locally. Current arrangement with node_4 vertically high gives longer compression members but insufficient for tension relief below.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Need to add nodal support between load node and supports to reduce tension on members directly connected to nodes_1 and 2. Possibly move node_4 left & decrease vertical height, adding node_5 to create triangular substructuring for better force flow. Increase bottom tension member areas selectively only where stress critical.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 below node_4 near load direction to create better force path; shift node_4 left closer to node_3 horizontally (~2.3-2.7 range) and reduce vertical height (~2.0 to 2.5). Increase area of bottom chord members near load (members from node_1 to node_3 and node_3 to node_2) to at least area_id \'5\' (4.887) from \'1\'. Keep compression members area moderate to save mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 creates additional load support triangle in load direction to reduce member_2 tensile demand by sharing load. Adjust node_4 position to allow more efficient force distribution reducing compliancy magnitude in bottom chords. Increasing relevant member_2 area reduces its stress, balancing with compressive members to maintain stability while respecting mass. Lowering node height reduces member length and mass while keeping stability and stress balance.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Estimate length for new members, calculate max stress allowable, set areas accordingly, ensure sum mass < 30 with selected areas. Evaluate geometry by simple statics principles to confirm force flow and reduced load on weaker members.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2m, node_3-node_2=4m. Increase member_2 area from 1 (0.195) to 5 (4.887) increases capacity ~ 25x reduces stress by factor of area ratio. Adding node_5 at approx.
