  "preamble": "Optimize a 2D truss with given loads/supports under mass and stress constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Loads: single downward-left force at node_3; supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2; current mass 41.7 > max 30; max stress 9.32 within limit 20.",
  "analysis": "Current design exceeds max mass constraint significantly. Stress is acceptable but conservatively low, indicating possible over-dimensioned members. Node_5 added complexity without effectively reducing weight. The structural layout can be simplified to reduce member lengths and member cross-sectional areas.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing heavier members (like member_1 and member_2 with area_id 5). Avoid redundant diagonals that increase mass without structural benefit. Consider moving or removing node_5, modify node_4 position for better load transfer, and rearrange members with smaller area sections. Node positions for load/support fixed.",
  "proposal": "Remove node_5. Keep only nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Reposition node_4 slightly higher to around (2.5, 3.0) to effectively form stable triangle. Modify members to form efficient triangular truss: members between (1-3), (2-3), (1-4), (2-4), (3-4), plus bottom base (1-2). Assign smaller areas to base and vertical members, larger area only for diagonal members carrying higher stress (estimated).",
  "reasoning": "A simple triangular truss uses minimal members and leverages triangulated geometry for efficient load transfer. Keeping support and load nodes fixed guarantees boundary conditions. Removing extra node removes unnecessary mass and simplifies stress distribution. Assigning areas based on member load paths reduces overall mass. Adequate height of node_4 (~3.0) ensures good stiffness against load at node_3; drop in node_4 avoids low length high area large mass members.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Remove node_5. Keep members: member_1 (1-3), member_2 (3-2), member_3 (1-2 base), member_4 (1-4), member_5 (2-4), member_6 (3-4). Use area mapping for members: vertical and diagonal load paths get moderate to high areas (2 or 3), horizontal less stressed get minimal (1). Approximate member lengths: 1-3 ≈ 2, 3-2 ≈ 4, 1-2 = 6, 1-4 ≈ 3, 2-4 ≈ 3.6, 3-4 ≈ 3.2. Calculated approx masses under chosen areas should be < 30.",
  "calculation": "Estimated areas: member_1(1-3): area 3 (1.759), length ~2 → mass ≈3.518; member_2(3-2): area 3 (1.759), length ~4 → mass ≈7.036; member_3(1-2): area 1 (0.195), length 6 → mass ≈1.17; member_4(1-4): area 2 (0.782), length 3 → mass ≈2.346; member_5(2-4): area 2 (0.782), length 3.6 → mass ≈2.82; member_6(3-4): area 3 (1.759), length 3.2 → mass ≈5.63. Sum mass ≈ 22.52 < 30 max, conforming to constraint. Stress ≤ ±20 fulfilled by choice of moderate areas. Height of node_4 and geometry provides stiffness, reducing member stress.",
