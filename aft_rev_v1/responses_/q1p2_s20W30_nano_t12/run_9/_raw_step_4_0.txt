Areas are fixed from pre-selected set. Current max stress is 9.19 with total mass 20.3, within constraints.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure at iteration 3 has reduced max stress from prior iterations. Stress concentrates on member_6 (-9.19MPa) and member_4 (8.15MPa). Compression and tension are sub-max capacity, so opportunities for stress leveling between members by slight node_4 repositioning exist. Load at node_3 fixed, support nodes fixed at nodes 1 and 2. Node_4 at (2.5, 2.75) can be shifted vertically to improve force distributions.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_6 linking node_3 to node_4 under high compression (-9.19), member_4 in tension (8.15). Slight raising or lateral shift of node_4 changes length/angle of members_4,5,6 thus stress sharing. Mass is already well below max (20.3 < 30), so candidate areas remain same. The topology is closed; no new members or nodes allowed for this iteration.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Slightly increasing height of node_4 reduces compression in member_6 by better force direction alignment, also reducing tension in member_4. Testing vertical position increase from 2.75 to around 3.0 while maintaining X=2.5 could smooth stress. Alternatively, shifting node_4 slightly right towards node_2 might decrease stress in members connected to node_4. These move impact member lengths/moduli; member areas remain unchanged.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "From geometry: current node_4 at (2.5,2.75), lengths: member_4 length ~ sqrt(2.5² + 2.75²)=3.74, member_5 length sqrt((6-2.5)²+2.75²)=4.2. If node_4 moved to (2.5,3), member_4 length =3.84 (+2.7%), member_5 length=4.27 (+1.6%). Examine if these increments reduce stress. Similarly, check effects on member_6 (node_3:2.0,0.0 to node_4). Mass impact minimal due to low elastic area usage.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Move node_4 to (2.5,3.0), member areas unchanged from iteration 3 {\'3\', \'3\', \'1\', \'2\', \'2\', \'2\'}. Total mass estimation still ~20.3 conservatively. Expected max stress reduction in member_6 by better angle alignment and slight relaxation of compression. Easy to keep stresses below limit ±20. Since max stress is sufficiently reduced compared to previous iterations, there\'s potential for further optimization.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes, no change to load/support nodes, structure remains closed with same member set, all constraints satisfied with margin. Slight upward reposition improves stress distribution mainly for critical member_6.
