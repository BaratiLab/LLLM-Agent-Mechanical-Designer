Largest stress members are at limits with safe margins (max stress=14.68 <20). Mass used is moderate (23.99 <30). Load node_3 fixed; supports node_1 and node_2 fixed. Internal nodes node_4, node_5 are movable and can be repositioned. Areas mostly small to medium, could be fine-tuned. Introducing member_6 clearance and philosophy allows triangular substructure with adequate load paths.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Potential to reduce stress further by small node repositioning to optimize joint angles and reduce bending moments and stress concentrations. Possibly redistribute area sizes more efficiently (areas: \'2\', \'3\', \'1\'). Avoid increasing node connections to keep mass down.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Main load applied at node_3 with resultant force vector direction -45°. Members connecting node_3 are primary load paths (members_1,2,6). Member_6 has low stress but large mass (6.42) — consider reducing cross-section area here or shortening length via small node_4 movement. Members_4 and member_2 positions can be optimized for stress distribution. Retain closed truss path node_1 → node_4 → node_5 → node_2 → node_3 → node_1 (adding member_6 closes a triangle good for stability).",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_3 fixed at (2.0,0.0). Move node_4 from (2.6,3.6) slightly downward to reduce length of high area members. Try node_4 (2.55,3.2). Node_5 fixed in x, small shift Y wise might help (but should maintain polygon closure). Trial to reduce cross-section area of member_6 from \'3\' (1.759) to \'2\' (0.782) to reduce mass if stress allows. Retest max stress after node move and this area change.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node moves expected to shorten or reduce tensile stress in members under direct load from node_3. Calculation indicates marginally shortening member_6 length (from node_3 to node_4) with node_4 lowering Y coordinate to 3.2 to reduce tensile stress and mass. Area of member_6 from 3 to 2 reduces mass significantly without exceeding target max stress of ±20 from previous value (-1.9337). Reassign member_4 to have original area from 3 (1.759) to 1 (0.195) if stress allows. Current stress of member_4 is -9.2665 suggesting reasonable safety margin. Changing area to smaller expected to be okay.
