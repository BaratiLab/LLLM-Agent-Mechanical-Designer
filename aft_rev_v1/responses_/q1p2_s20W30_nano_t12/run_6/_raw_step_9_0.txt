Current iteration 8 mass=17.44 good, max stress 57.86 exceeds limit. Need stress reduction mainly in member_4 (-57.86).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has light mass but fails stress constraint due to member_4 in compression (stress = -57.86 >> -20). Member_4 is node_4-node_5, area=1 (small). Also member_6 (node_3-node_4) has -13.04 stress near limit, origin of load near node_3 causes high stress in upper members. Member configurations do not provide adequate load transfer paths and redundant bracing. Node_5 lies horizontally next to node_4 causing long slender member_4 likely oversized stress, small area.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce member_4 compressive stress, increase cross-sectional area, add bracing or relocate node_5 to better share load. Try adding an auxiliary node above and between nodes 4 and 5 or shifting node_5 higher to make triangles more equal. Stronger diagonal bracing node_3-node_5 may help to spread compression. Choose areas optimally: use mid-size areas 2 or 3 for diagonals, 1 for small tension, 0 or 1 for lighter members.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep nodes_1,2,3 fixed. Move node_4 slightly higher & towards middle X=2.6 Y=3.8. Move node_5 slightly higher and to right X=4.2 Y=3.5 for improved geometry. Add an additional node_6 at (3.3, 4.3) above node_4-node_5 line to promote triangulation and remove compression peak. Members: connect {\'node_1\', \'node_3\'}, {\'node_3\',\'node_2\'}, {\'node_1\',\'node_4\'}, {\'node_3\',\'node_4\'}, {\'node_4\',\'node_6\'}, {\'node_5\',\'node_6\'}, {\'node_6\',\'node_2\'}, {\'node_5\',\'node_2\'}, {\'node_3\',\'node_5\'}. Areas assigned arrays mainly 2 or 3, highest area 3 only for critical diagonal members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_6 creates added triangulation between nodes 4,5,6 spreading compression in member_4. Shifting node_5 and 4 higher creates larger vertical height to reduce load pressure on bottom horizontal members. Diagonal members with moderate cross-section area 3 allow tension/compression carried to supports efficiently, lowering max stress. Keep supports as pinned and roller at node_1 and 2 for equilibrium. Avoid full stiff frame but maintain triangulation.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approximated by Pythagoras: node_1-node_3 length=2 invisible change; node_3-node_2 length=4, node_1-node_4 approx. 4.5 length, node_3-node_4 ~4 length; node_4-node_6 ~1.5 vertical; node_5-node_6 ~1.2; node_6-node_2 ~3.5; node_5-node_2 ~1.8; node_3-node_5 ~3.16.

Stress: Diagonal bracing with moderate section reduces stress concentrations; prior overload in member_4 will be lowered by redistributed load through node_6 supported diagonals.
