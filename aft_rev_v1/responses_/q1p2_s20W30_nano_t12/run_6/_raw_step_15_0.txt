Current mass 18.4 below max 30. Load at node_3 downward-left. Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller remain fixed. Two additional nodes possible. Ensure tension and compression balanced.",\n  "analysis": "Current design max compressive stress on member_6 (-28.05) over limit and tensile in member_3 and others below threshold. Mass is safe. Members with area 1 at highly stressed members need size adjustment or topology change. Adding nodes for better force path and changing members\' areas downward advised. Remove or downgrade overstrained and non-essential members. Avoid long-slender members prone to buckling.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Optimize by relocating node_4 for better triangular bracing, adjust node_5. Member areas in 0.195 to 0.782 range for highly stressed members to reduce mass and balance stress. Use key triangulation: node_1-node_4-node_5-node_2 and node_3-node_4-node_5 for force paths. Remove diagonals causing stress peaks above 20.",\n  "proposal": "Maintain existing nodes and adds node_6 at (3.0, 1.6) for triangulation to enhance force path. Modify member areas: major load-carrying members area 3 (0.782), some compression with area 2 (0.195) for buckling control, small tension members with low area 1 (0.195). Redesigned member set for clear load flow from node_3 downward, through tall node_4, node_6, node_5 towards supports, minimizing max stress and keeping mass under 30.",\n  "reasoning": "Adding one strategic node reduces unsupported lengths, stiffening structure. Member_6 from node_3 to node_4 area 1 -> too high stress, increase to 2. Reduce member_8 area from 1 to 1, minimal size. For nodes: elevated positions analyzed to create force triangles. Areas selected using given catalog to distribute forces under limits. Balanced compression and tension members optimize weight and stress conditions.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Length calculations checked, member forces estimate from load -10 at 45° down left only at node_3. Major compression expected along node_3 to node_4 and node_4 to node_2. Marginal tension on node_1 to node_3 and diagonals for stability. Areas mapped to balance stress under 20 absolute max.
