Mass 16.062 < 30, so we have margin to increase cross sections on critical members. Stress in member_6 is tension compression near limit. Loading at node_3 (-10, -45°) creates complex force paths. Members from node_3 to upper structure (nodes 4,5) need strengthening and potentially better load path. Members with small radius or less cross section under high stress need increase. No new distinct load nodes or supports allowed; but adding node(s) between existing nodes may improve truss behavior. Maintain triangulation and direct load paths from load node to supports for stress redistribution. Remove member_7 since it competes with member_6; or only one of member_6/member_7 may be sufficient.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_4 slightly left/up to increase lever arm and reduce tensile stress at member_6. Increase area of compressive and tensile members above 1 to reduce stress. Possibly remove member_7 for simplification. Verify redundancy and avoid overconstraints. Use high area profile (3 or 4) for critical compression members to reduce stress. Check lengths and impact on total mass. Reconnect members for load path, for example, consider adding node_6 near node_4 to split stresses if needed.",\n\n  "proposal": "Keep nodes node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed in position per constraints. Use current nodes node_4 (2.6,3.6) and node_5 (4.0,3.0) precise floats to optimize geometry. Remove member_7 (node_3-node_5) to avoid redundancy. Increase cross sections: \'member_6\' (node_3-node_4) area 3 (1.759), \'member_4\' (node_4-node_5) area 3 (1.759), \'member_2\' (node_3-node_2) area 3 (1.759). Reduce lower stressed members\' areas for mass balance, e.g. member_1 remain area 2 (0.782), member_5 (node_5-node_2) area 2 (0.782), member_3 (node_1-node_4) area 2 (0.782).",\n  \n  "reasoning": "The tensile member_6 is overloaded at area 1 (0.195), so increasing to area 3 (1.759) will reduce stress by almost factor 9. Similarly upgrading adjacent compression members prevents stress concentration. Removing member_7 avoids force path competition and possible stress escalation. Node_4 slightly moved up for longer lever arm reduces force in critical members. These measures reduce max stress below limit and keep mass far below max (under 30).",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths (~Euclidean distances): node_3-node_4 distance ~ sqrt((2.6-2)^2+(3.6-0)^2)= sqrt(0.36+12.96)= ~3.7m; node_4-node_5 (4-2.6, 3-3.6) = (1.4, -0.6) length ~1.52m; node_3-node_2 is 4m horizontal; masses sum approx length*area scaled by density= length×area with selected profile gives mass under 30; stresses scale inversely with area; Checks: area and length selection maintain total mass budget with margin.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Mass approximation: member_1 length ~2m *0.782 =1.6; member_2 length 4m*1.759=7.036; member_3 length ~3.6m*0.782=2.8; member_4 length ~1.5m*1.759=2.64; member_5 length ~3.2m*0.782=2.5; member_6 length ~3.7m*1.759=6.5; Sum mass≈ 23 kg approx acceptable under 30.
