    "preamble": "Optimize current 4-node truss to further minimize stress under constraints.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 12.93 well below ±20, mass 22.5 below 30 max. Attempt to reduce stress in high stressed members, focus on member_1 and member_5. Load/support nodes fixed; move node_5 only. Members areas mostly mid-range; try area reduction for lower stress members, optimize geometry for better load distribution.",

    "analysis": "The structure satisfies constraints at iteration 11; max stress well within ±20 and mass below 30. High compressive stress on member_1 (-12.93) and member_5 (-9.04). Member_3 and 4 tensile stresses are low (3.18 and 2.19). Node_5 at (2.0,3.1) currently. Geometry can be improved by slightly elevating node_5 vertically and slightly moving laterally to balance force paths, reduce buckling/compression in main chord members. Decrease member_3 and member_4 areas or member_1 and member_5 areas where stress is low. Use cross-sectional area IDs from the set: minimize area on low stress members and increase on high stress members within mass limit.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing axial compressive stress in member_1 by increasing height of node_5 for better load transfer, possibly shifting node_5 slightly to right (~2.1-2.2) for balance. Reconsider area: lower area_id for members under tensile stresses while maintaining larger area for compression members to reduce stress. Maintain closed truss shape with four nodes.",

    "reasoning": "Member_1 and member_5 are compressive and should carry force efficiently. Increasing height of node_5 improves triangulation and stiffness, distributing loads better, reducing peak stress. Members on compression paths may use larger areas (area_id=3) but mass constrained. Members under lower stress can have area reduced (area_id=1 or 2) to save mass for critical members. Positions shouldn't affect supports. We avoid new nodes. FEM iteration historically shows movement improving stress distribution. Current load is on node_3 horizontally and vertically, so geometry near node_3 node_5 neighborhood key.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate revised member lengths and stresses for node_5 moves: new node_5 roughly (2.15,3.4). Member lengths: node_1-node_3: 2; node_3-node_2: 4; node_1-node_5: sqrt((2.15)^2 + (3.4)^2)=~3.96; node_5-node_2: sqrt((6-2.15)^2 + (0-3.4)^2)=~4.9; node_3-node_5:sqrt((0.15)^2+ (3.4)^2)=3.4 approx. Use areas: member_1=2(0.782), member_2=2(0.782), member_3=2 (0.782), member_4=2 (0.782), member_5=1 (0.195) to redistribute mass favored to members with compression problems. Total area mass reduces or equal but stress reduces with better alignment.",

    "calculation": "Node_5 from (2.0,3.1) to (2.15, 3.4) nudges load path for better efficiency, Keep areas for members_1,2,3,4 at '2', reduce member_5 area to '1' to reduce mass and stress at member_5 which is between node_3 and node_5. Target max stress anticipated below 12 MPa based on improved geometry, total mass remains under 25 kg < 30 constraint.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "Verify closed structure preservation, no node duplicates, no support/load node movement. Member count five, all connected correctly. Using allowable areas IDs, reduced member_5 area to 1 (0.195), others at 2 (0.782). Node_5 shifted up/right slightly improves stress and redistributed forces. Total mass expected reduced or stable, stress minimized to near 12 MPa or lower.",
