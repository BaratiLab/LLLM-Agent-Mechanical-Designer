Current max stress near limit at 17.98. Mass slightly above 30. Need to reduce mass and balance stress. Areas from 0 (1) to 10 (19.5) available. Nodes fixed at supports/loads; others can move or be removed, but avoid complexity.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has too many members and possibly inefficient nodes. node_6 at high position increases member length and mass; members with area 3 get too stressed or overmassive. Use simpler truss type, place nodes to better triangulate load path. Minimize overlong members. Fewer, optimal area members and members aligned with expected force directions.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider removing node_6 and node_5 to reduce mass. Keep a high node_4 over node_3 to transfer load. Use members node_1-node_3-node_2 as base frame. Triangulate via node_4 at (2.5,3.5). Design members: (1-3), (3-2), (1-4), (4-2), (3-4). Assign areas: low in tension, larger in compression and critical members to control stresses below 20.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_5 and node_6.

Adjusting node_4 position balances load path to keep stresses in ±20. Using areas 2 to 4 matches size-strength required. Short diagonal members transfer loads effectively reducing member forces.
