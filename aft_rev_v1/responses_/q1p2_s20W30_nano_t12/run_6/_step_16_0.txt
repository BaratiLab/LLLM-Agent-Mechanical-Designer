  "stop": "True",
  "preamble": "Optimization achieved low max stress and mass within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current structure has max stress ~14MPa within ±20MPa, total mass 22.58 < 30 max mass constraint.",
  "analysis": "Members with highest stresses are moderate and well below permissible; area choices are balanced to avoid excess mass; node_6 added to improve stiffness and redundancy; all load/support nodes fixed per constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Attempting to shift internal nodes to reduce max stress further would risk breaking closed topology or exceed mass; member areas are efficient; reducing cross sections may increase stress beyond limits.",
  "reasoning": "Given maximum stress is significantly below ±20 and total mass is well within 30 units, further attempts to reduce stress may lead to increased mass or deterioration in stiffness; node positions optimized to spread load paths evenly; closures preserved; no duplicate members or nodes.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member areas mainly from 1,2,3 areas chosen for balance; node_4 and node_5 positions optimized to transfer load; node_6 added to form closed shape and enhance stability; topological and geometrical configurations provide good triangulation for stiffness.",
  "calculation": "Total mass = 22.58 < 30; max stress max abs value ~14MPa < 20MPa; member areas 1 to 3 ensuring enough load capacity; forces at node_3 (-10,-45deg), supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller) stable; structure is statically determinate and well triangulated.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "No violations to mass or stress found; further nodal adjustments unlikely to improve stress noticeably without penalty; structure is stable, closed, meets constraints and objectives; stopping optimization.",
