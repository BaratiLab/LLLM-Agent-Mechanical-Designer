Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) fixed. Nodes at base line between 0 and 6m. Two iterations have shown tensile/compressive stresses beyond limits especially members connected to node_3 and mass close to 12.1. Areas used range largely from 0.195 to 1.759. Current layout clusters members around node_3 and 4 with overlaps.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Stresses exceed ±20 in compression especially in members connected to node_3, indicating too high loads or inadequate bracing. Member_8: stress -37 and member_9: -35. Massive stress arises likely from long slender members with insufficient cross-section or inefficient geometry. Mass is 12.1, well below 30, so more area is possible. Adding node_5 helps stiffness but introduced stress concentration possibly because of placement. Need better geometry to redistribute stresses, reduce length of critical compression members, and pick efficient cross-sectional areas.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Idea: Add one more node higher above node_4 or between node_3 and node_5 to create triangular substructures that distribute load efficiently. Increase area on compression members adjacent to node_3 to lower stress and possibly delete redundant or overstressed members. Ensure no high bending. Avoid parallelogram types. Precise coordinates around load point can help stress flow.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node (node_6) near (2.6,3.8) to increase vertical support height between node_4 and node_5 for better triangulation. Remove member_8 (node_1-node_3) that produces high compression. Introduce members from node_6 to node_3 and node_2 to create multiple bracing paths. Area selections optimized: moderate areas for long tension and larger section for compression. Adjust areas: compression members near node_3 area 4 (3.128), tension members moderate 1 or 2 (0.195 or 0.782).",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing member_8 reduces compression overload hooking node_1 to node_3. Adding node_6 higher increases support to node_3 reducing bending length. Members from node_6 braces and stabilizes node_3 and node_5. Area selection balances stress and mass. Member orientation exploits triangular geometry for efficient force transfer. Maintaining pinned and roller support fixed ensures statically determinable structure.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Members: node_1-node_4 (truss left lower), node_2-node_5 and node_3-node_5 (top chords), node_4-node_6 and node_6-node_5 (upper triangulation). Remove overload linear member node_1-node_3. Check sum(length × area) <=30. Stress of critical member <20 in tension/compression by analysis of force paths and shorter compression members. Adequate minimal area used on tension members.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Approximate member lengths: node_1-node_4 ~3m, node_4-node_6 ~0.9, node_6-node_5 ~1.3, node_3-node_5 ~2.06, node_2-node_5 ~3, node_1-node_2 ~6, node_2-node_4 ~3.605. Multiply by suggested areas: e.g. node_1-node_4 area 2 (0.782) → 2.346 mass. node_4-node_6 area 1 (0.195) → ~0.175, node_6-node_5 area 2 → ~1.0, node_3-node_5 area 3 (1.759) → ~3.62. node_2-node_5 area 2 → 2.346, node_1-node_2 area 1 → 1.17, node_2-node_4 area 1 → 0.7. Sum mass approx 11.3 <30, satisfy mass. Stress balance from load path triangularization limits max stress <20 compression and tension.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_final": "Nodes and members remove high stress members and multiply bracing with new node_6 limit max compliance.
