Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Current design\'s max stress 31.9 > 20 and mass 59.7 > 30. Need to reduce stress and mass simultaneously.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has nine members and six nodes (some newly added). High mass mainly due to large area members at nodes 1-4, 4-2, and 5-2 connections, causing over mass and excess stress at members 7,8. Members near load region also show excessive stress and mass mismatch.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove or reduce areas on high-stress large mass members. Add bracing diagonals near load to reduce stress concentration. Move intermediate nodes slightly upward to reduce member length and improve force path. Rebalance cross members to alleviate stress peaks.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Reduce number and area of members connecting top nodes near load to support load transfer with lower mass. Restructure so nodes 4 and 5 are merged or relocated closer to load node_3 vertically. Introduce member between node_6 (low node near node_3) and node_5 to redistribute forces. Use minimal area sizes for members between low nodes. Retain support and load nodes positions.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Load at node_3 needs good triangulation to bases node_1 and node_2 via three-level triangle network. Smaller cross-sectional areas for members connecting nodes at base reduce mass but must maintain stress ≤20. Use mid-level vertical height ~3 to 3.5 to optimally distribute force. Providing nodes for close diagonal bracing reduces bending moments. Use smaller areas on smaller length members avoids mass excess.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths, choose lower areas on short length members but sufficient for stress. Check that all maximum tensile/compressive stresses ≤20 with removing or reducing oversized members. Simplified triangulation to achieve stability without redundancy for mass savings.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths approx: node_1-node_3 ≈ 2, node_3-node_2 ≈ 4, node_3-node_6 ≈ 0.9, node_6-node_1 ≈ 2, node_1-node_4 ≈ 3, node_4-node_2 ≈ 3.8, node_4-node_5 ≈1.4, node_5-node_2 ≈ 2.1, node_5-node_6 ≈ 1.4. Assign smaller areas: 0(\'1\'),1(\'0.195\'),2(\'0.782\'),3(\'1.759\') as needed.
