    "preamble": "Optimize a minimal mass, closed 2D truss under given load/support with max stress ±20 and mass ≤30.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes fixed; node_3 loaded (-10 N at -45°). Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Need closed truss: all nodes connected. Current nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0). Need additional node(s) to form closed shape and better distribute stresses.",
    
    "analysis": "Load at node_3 downward-left (Vector approx. Fx = -10cos45= -7.07 N, Fy=-7.07 N). Node_1 pinned and node_2 roller supports fix boundary. To close truss, add node_4 above to form a triangle: node_1-node_4-node_2. The third node (node_3) connected appropriately to node_4 for transfer of load. Use member connections: base (node_1-node_2), diagonals (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4), connections from node_3 to node_1 and node_4. This would create two triangles ensuring stability and closed form. Use area sizes strategically for mass-stress balance.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "New node added at top forming an apex above the base line nodes (node_1-node_2). Place node_4 vertically above node_3 to balance load and reduce axial forces in members. Approximate height of node_4 from node_3 using static design principle balancing moments to keep stress within limits.",
    
    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (2.0, y4) above node_3 to create two triangles. Members: base horizontal (node_1-node_2), left (node_1-node_4), right (node_2-node_4), bottom-left (node_1-node_3), bottom-top (node_3-node_4), bottom-right (node_2-node_3). Node_3 is load point; node_4 acts as apex to help reduce tensile/compressive stress on bottom chord and distribute load vertically. Aim for uniform stress distribution. Use areas from given discrete set, pick smallest where forces low to minimize mass. Strategy: longer members larger cross-section, short members smaller areas.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear static equilibrium, approx tension/compression force distributions, ignore bending of members (truss model), assign approximate forces using equilibrium in joints. Member length from Euclidean distance. Mass computed as sum(area × length). Area selection from given set aligned to forces to stay below ±20 stress. All stress in force/area and force = axial force. Gravity ignored as no info. Force load Fx and Fy components calculated as -7.07N each. Member cross sections chosen to limit force/area within ±20.",
