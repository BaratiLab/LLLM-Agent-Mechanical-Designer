Current max stress 36.26 > 20, total mass 8.56 well under 30. Need to reduce stress mainly in members 2 and 5.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure with node_3 on horizontal span leads to high stress in diagonal member_5 (node_3-node_4). The vertical member nodes (node_4) at (2,3) helps transfer load but current areas cause overstress. Member_5 stress is -36.26, double allowed max. Area of member_5 currently 0.195 must increase or re-arrange members to lower stress. The horizontal member_1 (node_1-node_2) area and length contribute some stress, mostly safe. Node_3 positioned close to node_1 and node_2 horizontally reduces load distribution efficiency. Adding an additional top node closer to load may better distribute forces. Using higher area members strategically and reducing length of highly stressed members will help. Member_6 large area 0.782 but low stress; possibly optimize down there to save mass. Overall mass is acceptable but stress constraint dominates. Proposal is to reposition load node_3 upwards towards node_4, add a new node to form better triangulation, and increase critically stressed member section areas.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Avoid changing support and load node locations; can add node_5 at (3.5, 2.0).

Keep total mass under 30. Aim for stress limits ±20. Increase area of member_5 to \'3\' and reduce length if possible by repositioning nodes.
