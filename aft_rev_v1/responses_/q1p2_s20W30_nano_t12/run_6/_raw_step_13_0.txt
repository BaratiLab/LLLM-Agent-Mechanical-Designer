Load at node_3 downward-left; supports: pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Given nodes node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed; node_5 movable within allowance.",\n  "analysis": "Stresses exceed max allowable mainly at \'member_5\' (node_3-node_5) = -36.3. All member cross-sectional areas currently are \'2\' except member_5 which is \'1\'. Member lengths relatively short except base between node_1 and node_2. Prior designs added node_4 for height and triangulation to reduce stress. Current instability possibly at diagonal members causing high compression. Large cross-sectional reductions seem needed, but capacity might be insufficient without better geometry.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Goal is to reduce stress in member_5 and member_1, maintain or slightly increase mass but keep total under 30. Add a higher top chord nodal point above node_5 to improve load path. Use areas selected from given discrete to optimize mass and strength. Use triangular bracing with longer diagonals, shorter top members for better force distribution.",\n  "proposal": "Fix node_1 at (0,0), node_2 at (6,0), node_3 at (2,0). Introduce node_4 above node_5 at (2.05,4.15) for height increase. Use node_5 higher and slightly right from current, at (3.6,3.18). Members: base members node_1-node_3 area 2, node_3-node_2 area 2; left triangle node_1-node_4 area 1, node_4-node_5 area 0, node_5-node_2 area 2; cross tie node_3-node_5 area 2; diagonal node_4-node_2 area 1; add node_4-node_3 diagonal area 1. This layout provides multiple force paths. Areas are chosen smaller for low stress dense members and sufficient for high stress members. Total estimated mass ~28 <30. Stresses expected under ±20.",\n  "reasoning": "Increasing height distributes load and reduces compression stress in chords and diagonal members. Adding node_4 creates stable triangular units, reducing stress peaks in key diagonals. Using smaller cross-section area in vertical node_1-node_4 reduces mass. Larger sections kept on base for shear force transfer and higher tension members (node_5-node_2). Area 0 (1.0) assigned to shorter low-stress members, area 1 (0.195) for low stresses but long members. Keeping areas optimized based on length and estimated loads ensures mass constraint adherence. Optimal triangular bracing layout with node_4 height allows better load paths.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and approximate masses: base members: approx 2 and 4 units length, two heights 3-4 length units approximately. Stress checks from prior steps show reduction expected due to triangle stabilization. Sum(member_length * area) < 30. Stress reduced due to better topology and cross-section reduction. Tension/compression distributed evenly.",\n  "calculation": "Lengths: node_1-node_3 ~2m, node_3-node_2 ~4m. node_1-node_4 sqrt(2.05^2+4.15^2)=~4.64m area 1=0.195, mass ~0.9. node_4-node_5 sqrt((3.6-2.05)^2+(3.18-4.15)^2)=~1.72m with area 0=1, mass ~1.72. node_5-node_2 sqrt((6-3.6)^2 + (0-3.18)^2)=~3.96m area 2=0.782, mass ~3.1. node_4-node_2 sqrt((6-2.05)^2+(0-4.15)^2)=~5.56m area 1=0.195, mass ~1.08. node_4-node_3 sqrt((2.05-2)^2+(4.15-0)^2)=~4.15m area 1=0.195, mass 0.81. Total mass estimate close to 12+ from prior steps plus added members sum ~13 to 15, under 30 allowed. Stresses expected distributed.
