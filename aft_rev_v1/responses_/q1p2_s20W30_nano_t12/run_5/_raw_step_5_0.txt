Current max stress ~11.12 and mass ~13.14, well below limits. Load at node_3, supports at nodes 1 and 2 fixed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Structure is a quadrilateral truss with 4 nodes and 6 members; node_4 x-pos optimized trailing between 2.2 and remained stable at 3.3 y-axis. Stress distribution fairly balanced, no member exceeds limits by margin. No single member close to yield or mass close to max.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Minor wards in node_4 position changed stress only slightly recent steps. Member areas retained small or moderate; increasing diameters would add mass, reduce stress but unneeded now. Member forces correlate well with node positions. Stability strong with pinned and roller support.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "With max stress 11.12 well below 20 and total mass 13.1 way below max mass 30, further changes risk instability, unnecessary complexity, or increased mass. Moving node_4 too far risks geometry loss or unwanted increases. Member sizes optimized for balance; adding members may add cost without stress gains given current low stress.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress max ~11.12 in member_1 compression; slightly reducing member length or increasing area marginally would drop stress but may risk mass increase. Node_4 adjustments ineffective recently. Additional members or nodes forbidden. Load at node_3 fixed, support nodes fixed. Given all and no violations, design likely optimal.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Current member areas and node positioning yield max_stress=11.12, well within ±20, total_mass=13.14 within limit. Improvements minimal and not justifying iteration. All node coordinates except node_3/load and nodes_1/2/support fixed.
