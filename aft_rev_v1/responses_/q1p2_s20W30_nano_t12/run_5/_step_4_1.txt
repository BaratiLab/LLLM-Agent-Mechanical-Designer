  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position for stress distribution and mass balance.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Goal: reduce max stress from current 11.58 while <= 20 allowed. Total mass 13.03 <= 30 allows some freedom. Node_1 and Node_2 fixed (supports), node_3 load fixed. Only node_4 can move.",

  "analysis": "Members with highest stress in magnitude: member_1 (-11.58 compressive), member_3 (-9.11 compressive). Area sizes used mostly in mid range (area_id 1 or 2). Member_3 length can be shortened or angulation changed to reduce force. Current node_4 at (2.4, 3.25). History shows node_4 shifted from (2.0,3.0) steadily upward and right leading to better stress & mass tradeoff. Member_3 area decreased from 3 to 2, reducing mass with sustained moderate stress. Areas could possibly be further balanced e.g. member_1 or member_3 maybe revisited area 2->1 or 3 if stress allows.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "By moving node_4 slightly towards node_1 or horizontally we could reduce length of high stress member_3, decreasing stress. Avoid making node_4 too close to node_3 vertically, reduce diagonal moment. Member_2 low stress now (5.7 compressive), areas could be verified for downscaling from 1. Consider rechecking area for member_1 (+/-11.58).",

  "reasoning": "Node 4 position is key to balancing load triangle. Moving node_4 slightly left and a bit up can reduce member_3 stress by shortening truss chord. Member_3 area 2 is sufficient for lower stress target. Shift node_4 left to ~2.2 and y upward to 3.3 could improve. Areas check: member_2 area 1 possible, member_1 area 2 acceptable. Member_6 connection and area 1 helpful as it provides stiffness across bottom chord noted. Structure is still closed and all nodes connected properly.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate length member_3 new approx: sqrt((2.0-2.2)^2+(0.0-3.3)^2) = sqrt(0.04 + 10.89)= sqrt(10.93) ~ 3.31 vs current ~3.27, similar length but angle improved. Member_1 length static = 2.0. Try node_4 = (2.2, 3.3). Expect stress member_3 reduce by geometry change. Member mass new estimates consistent with reduced force.",

  "calculation": "Update node_4 from (2.4,3.25) to (2.2,3.3). Keep member areas same. Member lengths compute approximately. Total mass approximate ~13.0 (as before). Max stress likely reduce slightly with node re-position because loading angle improved. Stress member_3 expected to go closer to -8 ~ -7 compressive. Check no constraints violated.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints hold. Max stress < 20. Total mass < 30. No nodes overlapping or duplicates. Members connected same with areas maintained. Optimization plausible by improving node_4 position. Stop now would be premature, gains possible by iterative fine node_4 shift.",
