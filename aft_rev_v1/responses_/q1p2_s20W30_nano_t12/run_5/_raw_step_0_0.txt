Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass 30 units, areas discrete from given set. Aim for all nodes connected in closed truss to reduce member stress.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The three nodes lie on x-axis. Load at node_3 acts diagonally down-left, causing tensile/compressive forces. To form a closed truss, need to add nodes vertically to allow triangular members. Triangular configurations reduce member forces and stabilize structure. Need minimal new nodes to keep mass low. Adding one node above node_3 at ~ (2, 3.0) provides height for triangle to node_1 and node_2, creating two triangles joined at node_3 and new node_4. Then connect new node_4 to node_1 and node_2 to close truss. Member areas chosen to balance between minimum mass and acceptable stress based on assumed forces.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Considering adding node_4=(2.0, 3.0). Members: (node_1-node_3), (node_2-node_3), (node_3-node_4), (node_1-node_4), (node_2-node_4). Five members create two triangles, a closed structure. Estimate forces with load vector components distributed by geometry, stresses approximated by force/member length/area, assuming axial forces only. Areas selected from set, preferring lower values for longer members unless stressed higher.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular closed geometry is statically determinate and optimal for force distribution. Load at node_3 is balanced by axial forces in members with node_4 as a strut transferring load to supports at node_1 and node_2. Member areas adapted by relative lengths and expected force.

Mass sum: ∑ length*area ≤ 30. Assume small areas for longer members (e.g. 1 or below from given set). Stress ≈ Force / (Area * allowable limit), force distribution approximated from equilibrium.
