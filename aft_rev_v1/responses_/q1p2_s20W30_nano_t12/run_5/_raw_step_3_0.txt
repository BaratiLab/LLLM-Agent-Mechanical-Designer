Current max stress ~11.37 (safe), total mass ~16.96 (safe). Load at node_3 (-10, -45°), supports fixed. Nodes with load/support fixed; only node_4 movable.",\n  "analysis": "Stress mostly compressive on member_1 (-11.36) and moderate in others; member_3 has reduced stress but large mass contribution. Current design uses larger areas (member_3 has area 3) resulting mass increase. Node 4 raised further previously to reduce stress in members 2 and 5. Member areas chosen tend to reduce stress but cost in mass. We can attempt slight repositioning of node_4 to balance member length/stress and reconsider member_3 area. Connections form stable closed truss. No excess constraints violated.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Current high mass is driven by member_3 with area_id \'3\' and length from node_3 (2,0) to node_4 (2.4,3.5). Shorter or smaller area member_3 might reduce mass and stress. Area 2 or 1 might still satisfy strength. Try slightly lowering node_4 in Y (from 3.5 to ~3.2-3.3) reduces length and may reduce stress in member_3, allows for smaller area. Maintain horizontal positions due to constraint not to move load/support nodes, only node_4 movable.",\n  "reasoning": "Reduce node_4 y from 3.5 to about 3.25 for compromise between decreased length of member_3 and retaining geometry for load paths and closing truss. Then reduce member_3 area from \'3\' (1.759) to \'2\' (0.782) to cut mass by more than half for that member. Small increase of stress expected but within ±20. Areas of other members kept as current; member_1 area \'2\', member_2 area \'1\', members 4 & 5 area \'2\', member_6 area \'1\'. This should keep stress safe and mass closer towards 12-14. Member lengths estimated to slightly shorten member_3. Members 1 and 6 lengths fixed. Member stress expected within constraints. Members connections kept same. This shift will further minimize max stress and mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate length member_3 new: node_3(2,0), node_4(2.4,3.25); length ≈ √(0.4² + 3.25²)=√(0.16 +10.5625)=√10.7225=3.275. Original length was √(0.4² +3.5²)=3.532. Approx 7% length reduction. Member_3 mass addressed: length*area. New mass ≈ 3.275 * 0.782=2.56 approx. Previous was 6.1966, large reduction. Total mass drops ~4 approx to <13, well below 30 constraint.",\n  "calculation": "Update node_4: y=3.25 x=2.4. Member_3 area: from \'3\' (1.759) -> \'2\'(0.782). Recompute mass approx as 1.56+0.78+2.56+3.31+3.93+1.17~13.3 estimated.
