Current max stress ~11.2, total mass ~12.9. Allow some mass increase to reduce stress further by adjusting node_4 position and areas.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress significantly below limit, mass also well below max. The load node and supports fixed. Current node_4 is at (2.2, 3.2). Member stresses range from about ±11 MPa. Stress reduction possible by repositioning node_4 slightly to balance axial forces better and reassigning cross-sectional areas - larger areas to heavily loaded members to reduce stress, smaller to less stressed. Current design uses some smaller areas but mass mainly from members to node_4. Adding member_6 (cross ground) distributed load better but stress exist. Symmetry or near-symmetry in node layout might help. Use areas from catalog. Areas \'2\' (0.782) and \'1\' (0.195) are on member_1,2,... Try to allocate member_3 and members involving node_4 larger area to reduce stress there. Reposition only node_4 within limit to optimize geometry.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Think about node_4 position to reduce bending effects and member axial stresses, probably raise it a little more, or shift slightly right to balance member_3 and members connected. Possibly increase area for member_3, keep member_4 and member_5 moderate area but still less than max to keep mass under 30. Reduce area on low-stress members such as member_2 and member_6 if possible to save mass as margin for enlarging critical members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "To minimize max stress, increase effective truss action, reduce member forces by balancing geometry of node_4 in relation to load at node_3 and supports at node_1 and node_2. Careful selection of cross sectional areas based on stress magnitude can optimize stress distribution and total mass. Keep node_4 x coordinate close to 2 - 2.5 and increase y coordinate slightly to improve force angles. Member 3 (node_3-node_4) under compression close to -9, increasing area reduces stress. Similarly provide adequate areas in members connected to node_4. Maintain area 1 and 2 member areas to keep mass moderate.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Max stress ≈ |11.2|; max allowed 20. Total mass 12.9 < 30. Consider node_4 at (2.4, 3.5) for more balanced force triangle. Increase member_3 area to \'3\' (1.759) from \'2\' (0.782) to lower stress. Members 4 and 5 currently \'2\' (0.782) can be kept but check stresses. Reduce member_2 area from 1 (0.195) to 0 (1) may reduce mass if stress low - but catalog ariambiguous, confirm with mass data given? Reverse ids may be clarifications needed. Use catalog areas exactly. Let member_1 stay 2; member_6 keep at 1 or 2 depending on mass-stress tradeoff. Cross-check mass after sizing.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Lengths: member_1 (node_1 to node_3) = distance (0,0)-(2,0)=2.0, member_2 (node_2 to node_3)=(6,0)-(2,0)=4.0, member_3 (node_3 to node_4)=distance from (2,0) to (2.4,3.5)=√(0.4^2 + 3.5^2)=~3.53, member_4 (node_1 to node_4): (0,0)-(2.4,3.5)=√(2.4^2+3.5^2)=4.23, member_5 (node_2 to node_4): (6,0)-(2.4,3.5)=√(3.6^2+3.5^2)=~5.02, member_6 (node_1-node_2): 6.0 length. Compute member masses with chosen areas and lengths. Use areas: member_1=2(0.782), member_2=1(0.195), member_3=3(1.759), member_4=2(0.782), member_5=2(0.782), member_6=1(0.195). Then member_mass = length x area factor (assumed from catalog) for each member. Approximate total mass and confirm below 30. The larger area on member_3 to reduce stress here makes sense, while keeping member_2 and member_6 area low saves mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_final": "Adjusted node_4 to (2.4,3.5) to optimize force paths inferentially.
