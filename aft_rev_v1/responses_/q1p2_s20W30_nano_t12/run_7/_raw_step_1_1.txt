Load at node_3 downward-left, supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 fixed.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing mass risks increasing stress; enlarging member areas might reduce stress but increases mass; moving unloaded node (node_4) could better orient geometry and manage stresses.",\n  "reasoning": "To minimize max stress, improving force flow by slight reposition of node_4 to reduce eccentricity and improve load path will help. Increase areas for heavily stressed members (member_1) while slightly decreasing areas of less stressed members to stay below mass limit. Node_3 position is fixed due to load, node_1 and node_2 fixed as supports, so only node_4 moved precisely.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member 1 (node_1 to node_3) most stressed compression at -13.86; reinforcing it with a larger area (from 2 to 3) may reduce stress by lowering axial stress. Node_4 moved modestly upwards and slightly right to improve truss shape; modification within reasonable limits to preserve closed geometry. Member areas adjusted carefully: member_1 area 3, member_2, 3, members 4 and 5 area 2 to prevent mass increase.",\n  "calculation": "Node_4 moved from (2.8,3.5) to approximately (3.0,3.8) to optimize geometry.
