Max stress ±20, mass ≤30. Current design fails due to high stress on member_3 (-112.9). Areas used mostly small, so increase diagonal support and reconfigure.",\n  "analysis": "Current structure has too high compressive stress in member_3 (\'node_4\'-\'node_5\') due to insufficient diagonal bracing and small cross section. Mass low but stress out of bounds. Need better triangulation to distribute loads, consider adding nodes and members or moving node_4 & node_5 higher to reduce compression in center. Current forces create high axial loads on cross braces.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Removing member from \'node_4\' to \'node_5\' to reduce compressive stress; adding top chord nodes at higher elevation for stiffer arch; adding diagonal toggle members from peak nodes to load node. Use larger area for main compression but limit mass by keeping smaller cross sections on diagonals. Use areas 3 to 5 for bottom and top chord, 1 to 2 for diagonals.",\n  "proposal": "Maintain node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Add node_4 and node_5 raised to y=2.4 for top chord of truss. Add node_6 at midpoint top between node_4 and node_5 at y=2.8 for stiffer triangulation. Members: bottom chord from node_1 -> node_3 -> node_2 with medium area (3), top chord node_4 -> node_6 -> node_5 (medium area 3), vertical chord node_4 & node_5 to bottom chord nodes at node_1 and node_2 and node_3 (light areas). Add diagonal bracings from node_6 to node_3 with light cross section. This triangular truss should distribute load efficiently.",\n  "reasoning": "Keeping supports and load gems fixed. Slight elevation of top chord reduces compression in mid chord member. Adding the extra node_6 to divide top chord allows smaller areas and less compression. Use larger areas for bottom compression (long spans) and lighter areas for diagonals and shorter members to reduce mass. This balanced design with top chord supported in three segments minimizes max stress within allowed range.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and mass estimates for all members based on distances.
