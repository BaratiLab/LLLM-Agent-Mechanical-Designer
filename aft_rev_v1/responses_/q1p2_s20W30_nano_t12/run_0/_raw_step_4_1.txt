Current design has acceptable max stress (~13.86) but slightly exceeds mass (30.74 > 30). Load is at node_3 (horizontal nodes 1,2 fixed).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has redundant heavy members (member_1, member_2 each have area id = 4 → 3.128 cross-sectional area), contributing significant mass but modest stress. Mass excess mainly due to these large-area members connecting boundary nodes vertically to top-level nodes at y=2.5. Members converging to node_3 with moderate areas (2) carry compression/tension stresses within limits. Supports: node_1 pinned (0,0), node_2 roller (6,0). Node_3 loaded at (-10, -45) degrees roughly downward-left force.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce cross-sectional areas of heavy verticals (member_1 and member_2) or remove/reposition nodes and redistribute members for lighter structure without increasing stress. Possibly move top nodes to better distribute load paths and add diagonal bracing. Maintain stability and load path from node_3 to supports.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Simplify node layout by repositioning top nodes closer (y=2 max), reducing member_areas of vertical members to smaller cross sectional area while maintaining truss stability. Introduce diagonal members at smaller cross-section to balance stresses. Remove member_6 and member_7 (long base chords and their areas are somewhat high). Use area ids of 2 or 1 to reduce mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Reducing area_id from 4 (3.128) to 2 (0.782) or 1 (0.195) on largest members will halve/triple reduce their weight. Moving top nodes downward reduces member length and therefore member mass. Adding diagonals spreads forces better allowing smaller areas. Eliminate direct base chord members that add stress without useful load path given loading at node_3 lies away. Members connecting node_1/node_2 to mid-top nodes will have smaller length and smaller cross areas reducing mass. Maintain main load transfer path from node_3 to supports through top nodes.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Current mass capped at 30. Current total_mass=30.74, areas mostly at 4 or 2 dominance. Vertical members ~10 each, others contribute moderate masses. Plan to reduce heavy areas, nodal heights to reduce member lengths and area combination weight. Doing this will reduce mass under 30 while keeping max stress under 20.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Reduce area_id of vertical members from 4 to 2: mass ∝ length × reduction from 3.128 to 0.782 (~25% of original). Move node_4 and node_5 from y=2.5 to y=1.8 for 28% length reduction. Remove base chord members (\'member_6\' and \'member_7\') reduces extra mass ~4.7 units from last iteration. Add diagonal members (\'node_4\'-\'node_3\' and \'node_5\'-\'node_3\') with area 1 to share loading between vertical and diagonals. Mass estimated < 29 after reductions with new topology.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "New design uses 5 nodes (original support and loaded nodes fixed in place). Top nodes lower y-wise (1.8) fewer and reduced-area cross sections. Diagonal members added to reduce stress concentration, no base members to save mass.
