  "preamble": "Optimizing 2D truss positioning and cross-section areas to minimize max stress.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "The current max stress is 15.2 MPa (within ±20 MPa limit) and total mass is 18.62 (below 30 max mass). Objective is to reduce max stress further by repositioning intermediate nodes and possibly increase areas for critical members without exceeding constraints.",
  
  "analysis": "Noticed members_7 and 8 have high compressive stresses (-14.67, -15.19), member_10 and 5 in tension (~13.65 and 7.91). Members near node_6 and node_4 affected most. Node_6 is slightly higher than node_4 and node_5, meaning force is complex across nodes 4-5-6 and connections with node_3. Current intermediate nodes are well spread but need fine repositioning to balance load between top members. Also, area changes: member_3 area id changed from 1 to 2 to reduce stress. Member_4 area is 1, possibly small cross-section for tensile loading. Area increases can be targeted but mass budget available.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Modify nodal y-positions of nodes 4,5,6 slightly upward or downward to better align force flow; potentially increase area on highly stressed members (7,8 to 2 or 3) and redistribute load to reduce stress magnitude. Ensure area increments keep total mass <30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Lateral load at node_3 at 45 degrees downward to left suggests pulling loads on left-side members. Increasing height of node_6 can reduce compression along top chord members. Increasing cross section areas for highly stressed members reduces stress. Careful incremental adjustments minimize stresses while avoiding mass penalty excess.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Currently member_7 stress -14.67 MPa with area 1; increasing area from 1(0.195) to 2(0.782) would reduce stress to ~-(14.67*0.195/0.782)= -3.65 MPa, great improvement with moderate mass increase (0.6724 to approx 2.69). Member_8 also similar. Node_6 from 3.3 down to ~3.1 reduced stress before (iteration_6), can adjust between 3.1-3.3. Node_4,5 lower (2.0) suggest revisiting positions: slightly closer spaced in x-direction to reduce bending if possible but preserving closed shape. I recommend keeping load/support nodes fixed, minor adjustment only on nodes 4,5,6.",
  
  "calculation": "Adjust node_6: y=3.15 (between 3.1 and 3.3, lowered 0.15m). Increase member_7 and member_8 area to '2'. Adjust node_4 y to 2.2 (up by 0.2m), node_5 y to 2.2 (up by 0.2m) to decrease stress on members 5 and 10. Double check mass impact: area increases from 1 to 2 for members 7,8 adds ~(0.782 - 0.195) × length (≈3.4) ≈ 2.0 extra mass. New total mass roughly 18.62 + 2.0 = 20.6 < 30, safe. Expect max stress to reduce below current 15.2 MPa by better force flow and bigger cross-section on critical members.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Adjust intermediate node y-positions: node_4 and node_5 to 2.2, node_6 to 3.15; increase areas on member_7 and member_8 to '2' to reduce compression stresses. Keep load/support nodes fixed. Maintain closed truss with added member_10 intact, keep all original members. Verify no duplicates and constraints met.",
