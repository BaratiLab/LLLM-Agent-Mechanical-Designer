Load at node_3 (-10, -45°). Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Existing nodes: node_1,2,3 fixed; interior nodes can be added/moved except 1,2,3. Current design overstressed up to 3000 units, mass 11.4, far exceeding stress limit. Areas currently range 0.195-0.782 mostly."\n  ,\n  \n  "analysis": "High stresses arise in members involving node_4 and internal bracing. Large stresses (~3000) indicate poor load path and undersized members or unsuitable geometry. The key is improving load transfer from loaded node_3 at x=2 to supports at nodes_1 and 2 spaced at x=0 and 6, y=0. Original node_4 (~3,3) and nodes_6,7 added did not reduce stress successfully. Required to redesign truss with clearer load paths and adequately sized members."\n  ,\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Idea: Use a simple truss with diagonal bracing from load to supports forming triangles to distribute forces. Keep load and supports fixed (node_1,2,3). Add nodes aligned vertically above node_3 and between nodes_1 and 2 at mid-y levels. Connect with short members to reduce high bending moment. Use moderate to small area indices, challenging strength by improving geometry."\n  ,\n  \n  "proposal": "Nodes: Keep node_1 (0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Add two new nodes: node_4(2,2.5) vertically above load for triangle formation and node_5(4,2.5) to help load transfer towards node_2. Members: member_1: node_1-node_4; member_2: node_2-node_5; member_3: node_4-node_5; member_4: node_4-node_3; member_5: node_5-node_3; member_6: node_1-node_3; member_7: node_2-node_3. Area assignments: smaller areas (1 to 3) except main transfer arms at 3 to 4."\n  ,\n  \n  "reasoning": "Structure forms two triangles: node_1-4-3 and node_2-5-3 connected by node_4-node_5 brace; members toward supports node_1-node_3 and node_2-node_3 to improve stiffness. Placement balances vertical and diagonal members distributing load without large member length so forces reduce. Using moderate sectional areas consistent with stress limits as per formulas: stress ∝ load / (area × length). Mass reduces by avoiding long heavy members."\n  ,\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths estimated: 1-4 ≈ 2.5, 2-5 ≈ 2.5, 4-5 = 2 approx, 4-3 = 2.5, 5-3 ≈ 2.5, 1-3 = 2, 2-3=4.
