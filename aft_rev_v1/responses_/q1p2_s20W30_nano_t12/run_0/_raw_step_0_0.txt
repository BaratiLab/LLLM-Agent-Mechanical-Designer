Load applied at node_3 (-10N at -45°). Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Goal: form a closed truss (triangle or polygon) connecting these nodes to distribute stress; constraints max stress ±20, mass ≤ 30 using discrete area sections. Need new nodes to close the structure. For minimum mass and low stress, minimal added member length and cross-section is ideal. Possibly add 1 or 2 nodes above line (0,0)-(6,0) for a triangle with elevation for better load transfer.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Given all three original nodes are collinear on y=0, direct connection between node_1, node_2, node_3 will have mainly axial forces but no closed polygon. The load (-10N at -45°) at node_3 downward-left creates bending; without a closed truss, stress concentration at members adjacent to node_3 risk exceeding limits. To form a closed truss, we must add at least one node off this line, preferably above span to resist compression and tension efficiently. A simple symmetric triangular truss formed by adding one node \'node_4\' centered horizontally between node_1 and node_2 with vertical coordinate optimized to minimize stress and mass. Then connect node_4 to all base nodes node_1, node_2, and node_3. This creates a stable triangular frame distributing forces. Areas assigned to members aiming to just keep stress within ±20 and minimal total mass constraint observed.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "To check member lengths: Base length is 6 units (node_1 to node_2). node_3 lies at (2,0) near node_1, connected to node_4 at (3,y4). y4 to be optimized between 1 and 3. Members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2. Considering structure simplicity, exclude node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2 since they are colinear, unneeded, and may overload. Use only members between node_4 and base nodes, plus base member node_1-node_2 for completeness and stiffness. Check tension/compression with vector projections.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Assuming 2D static equilibrium, sum of forces in x and y zero, ignoring joint rotations (pin joints). Each member force related to axial stress σ = F / A. Max stress allowed ≈20; Assume material stress corresponds to force divided by cross-sectional area. To minimize mass = ∑(length * area chosen discreetly). For length measurements use Euclidean distance. Area pick from given discrete set {0:1,1:0.195,...10:19.548}. For minimum mass select minimal area permitting stress ≤20. Approach: Force equilibrium at loaded node_3 and at supports. Placing node_4 exactly at midpoint x=3, set variable y4=optimized height for resolving load and minimizing stress and member length sum.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Set node_4 = (3.0, y4).

Calculate axial forces normalized by area to keep stress ≤ 20 (units consistent). Mass = sum(L_i * A_j) with A_j from area set capping at 30 mass unit.
