Current design satisfies constraints but max stress ~11.01 is non-negligible.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current max stress 11.01 is well within ±20 limit and total mass 21.92 is under 30 max. Load nodes and supports are fixed; node_3 bearing the load at (-10, -45°). Members with highest stresses: member_4 (11.006 tensile), member_1 (-6.09 compressive). Cross-section areas vary, member_4 uses minimal area \'1\', member_1 has larger \'3\'. Move free nodes (node_4, node_5, node_6) with small adjustments to optimize force distributions and reduce peak stress. Slightly increase area of the smaller members under higher stress (e.g., member_4) if required. Adding member_10 (between node_4 and node_5) helps joint stability. Member_7,8 stressed moderately; direction of load results in stress distribution supporting node_6 elevation. Current node_6 height at 3.15 seems to support structure well; small vertical adjustment may improve force balancing between top nodes. Distance from node_3 to node_6 set via members 7,8. Mass is sufficiently under limit for small area variations. Focus of optimization: node_4, node_5 vertical shift ~±0.2m, node_6 vertical shift ~±0.15m; minor adjustments. Cross-section areas can be revised slightly, minimizing mass increase while lowering peak stresses.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To bring member_4 stress from 11.006 to lower around 8-9, consider slight reduction of length or shifting node_6 closer to node_5—approximately decrease length on member_4. For member_3, area \'2\' seems fine, might tentatively keep or reduce if stress at 4.4 shrinks with node move. Member_1 area \'3\' (larger) needed for compression (-6.09) remains unchanged. Member_7 also uses \'2\' with -4.42 stress: keeping may help. Member_8 (‘2’, -3.46) and member_9 (\'1\', -8.09) can be slightly re-balanced by line straightening nodes. Member_10 helps closure, area \'1\' acceptable. Trial decreasing node_4 and node_5 vertical coordinate by ~0.15 to 2.05, increasing node_6 vertical slightly to 3.3, pulling top triangle flatter to spread loads more evenly.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Load at node_3 downward-left imposes tension and compression path through node_4, node_5, and node_6. Compression tends along nodes 1-3 and node_1-4, so large cross-section area on member_1 justified. To reduce peak stress on member_4, vertical realignments to reduce load asymmetry and length of member_4 effective. Adding length to member_6 marginally by nodal movement spreads forces. Smaller cross sections on more members can stay for optimum mass. Maintaining closure and connectivity avoids creating instability. No need to add nodes or members; repositioning nodes suffices for given load/support fixes.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Positions (x,y): keep fixed nodes: node_1 (0.0, 0.0), node_2 (6.0, 0.0), node_3 (2.0, 0.0).
