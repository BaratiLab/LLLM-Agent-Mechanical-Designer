Mass is well below max with margin. Nodes at load/support fixed as required. Small overall stresses and redundant connectivity prevent stress concentration.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Potential improvements include moving non-critical node_4 to redistribute forces, adjusting member areas for optimization, adding members increases mass and complexity so avoided.",\n  "reasoning": "Load direction and magnitudes generate compressive stress in member_1 that is dominant. Moving node_4 horizontally alters force paths. Currently nodes reasonable position geometric and force flow wise; minor perturbations unlikely to significantly reduce max stress. Due to constraints no load/support node movement allowed.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member areas already moderate (2=0.782). Increasing area reduces stress but adds mass unnecessarily; decreasing area risks violating constraints.
