  "preamble": "Current structure meets constraints with max stress 15.07 below limit 20 and total mass 11.965 below 30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Minimize stress further under given load while maintaining support and load nodes, no duplicates, keep closed truss and mass <30.",
  "analysis": "Current design has maximum compressive stress at member_1 (-15.07), reasonably below allowable 20. Mass is well below max with margin. Nodes at load/support fixed as required. Small overall stresses and redundant connectivity prevent stress concentration.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Potential improvements include moving non-critical node_4 to redistribute forces, adjusting member areas for optimization, adding members increases mass and complexity so avoided.",
  "reasoning": "Load direction and magnitudes generate compressive stress in member_1 that is dominant. Moving node_4 horizontally alters force paths. Currently nodes reasonable position geometric and force flow wise; minor perturbations unlikely to significantly reduce max stress. Due to constraints no load/support node movement allowed.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member areas already moderate (2=0.782). Increasing area reduces stress but adds mass unnecessarily; decreasing area risks violating constraints. Geometry balanced for load directions.",
  "calculation": "Total mass = 11.965 < 30, max stress = 15.07 < 20 safely. Redistribution took node_4 at (2.0, 2.0). Moving node_4 horizontally down slightly shaved peak stresses minimally but not effectively here.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify constraints: all members within Â±20 stress, mass well below limit. Members adequate size/area, no new nodes or unsupported changes. Closed truss maintained.",
