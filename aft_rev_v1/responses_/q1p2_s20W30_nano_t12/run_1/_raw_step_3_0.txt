Member areas generally small, especially member_3 (area id 1 = 0.195) with excessive stress. Mass low at 8.9525, so have margin to increase member areas strategically. Node_4 at (3,2.4) creates steep compression. Members connecting node_4 are under compressive stress exceeding limit, especially member_3.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress, improve load path and add reinforcing diagonal members. Changing node_4 y-position may reduce stress by improving angular force distribution. Increasing member_3 area only marginally possible; better to refine geometry or add members. Need stable structure with fewer stress concentrations.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add auxiliary node to the right of node_4 at (4.2, 1.8) to create longer triangular support frame reducing compressive stress on member_3. Connect member_6 (node_4 to node_5) and member_7 (node_5 to node_2). Adjust members sizes to balance stresses—use thicker areas for members closer to load paths.\\nMembers:\\n- member_1: node_1-node_3 area 2 (0.782)\\n- member_2: node_2-node_3 area 2 (0.782)\\n- member_3: node_3-node_4 area 4 (3.128) increased to reduce stress\\n- member_4: node_1-node_4 area 1 (0.195) minimal strut\\n- member_5: node_2-node_4 area 1 (0.195)\\n- member_6: node_4-node_5 area 2 (0.782)\\n- member_7: node_5-node_2 area 2 (0.782)",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 provides additional load path, reducing compressive stresses in member_3 by branching load through member_6 and member_7. Increasing member_3 area reduces stress by increasing cross-section under compression. Areas selected for balancing mass and strength. Supporting nodes unchanged. Stress in members closer to supports lower, so small areas suffice. Triangular bracing geometry enhances stability.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Length calc: member_3 (~2.77), member_6 (~1.44), member_7 (~1.80).

Member 3 mass: length*area=2.77 x 3.128=8.67. Others smaller, total sum likely ~15<30 safe. Stress in heavy loaded members reduces by load redistribution.
