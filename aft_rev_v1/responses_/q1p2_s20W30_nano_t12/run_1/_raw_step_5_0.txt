Load at node_3 is large, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) fixed. Node_3 cannot move, optimize node_4 only.",\n  "analysis": "Current max stress is 18.08 with mass 14.26, both within constraints. Member stresses are well balanced, with highest compressive tension at member_4 (-18.08), using area index \'2\' (0.782).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further reduction of max stress unlikely by moving node_4 because of nodal load concentration and constraints on moving node_3; nodal position of load and supports fixed.",\n  "reasoning": "Member areas chosen moderate thus reduce unnecessary mass; reducing areas further risks compromising stress constraints. Node_4 position at (3.0, 2.0) seems well placed for load transfer. Adding members can increase complexity and mass without lowering max stress significantly.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress limited by load at node_3 and nodal geometry. Calculated member lengths and stresses indicate fair distribution; areas correspond well to force levels. Max stress close to but under allowable ±20.",\n  "calculation": "Member lengths approx: 1_4=~3.61, 2_4=~3.61, 3_4=~2.236, 1_3=2.0, 2_3=4.0.
