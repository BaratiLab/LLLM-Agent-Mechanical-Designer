  "preamble": "Current 2D truss design meets constraints with max stress below limit and mass well inside limit.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Aim to minimize max stress below ±20 and total mass under 30. Load at node_3 is large, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) fixed. Node_3 cannot move, optimize node_4 only.",
  "analysis": "Current max stress is 18.08 with mass 14.26, both within constraints. Member stresses are well balanced, with highest compressive tension at member_4 (-18.08), using area index '2' (0.782).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further reduction of max stress unlikely by moving node_4 because of nodal load concentration and constraints on moving node_3; nodal position of load and supports fixed.",
  "reasoning": "Member areas chosen moderate thus reduce unnecessary mass; reducing areas further risks compromising stress constraints. Node_4 position at (3.0, 2.0) seems well placed for load transfer. Adding members can increase complexity and mass without lowering max stress significantly.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress limited by load at node_3 and nodal geometry. Calculated member lengths and stresses indicate fair distribution; areas correspond well to force levels. Max stress close to but under allowable ±20.",
  "calculation": "Member lengths approx: 1_4=~3.61, 2_4=~3.61, 3_4=~2.236, 1_3=2.0, 2_3=4.0. Mass computed as member length × area density from map indexed by areas selected. Total mass 14.2643 well below threshold 30.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "No close-to-limit member stress direction changes or magnitude that suggest reallocation of area sizes or nodes moving are likely to reduce max stress meaningfully while keeping mass low. Supports and load fixed enforce a responsive truss shape already achieved.",
