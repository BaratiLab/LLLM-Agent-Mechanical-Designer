To make it stable and closed with minimal stress, add one node above the line to form a triangular truss. Position node_4 above the middle node_3 at (2.0, y), y>0 to transfer load through members. Members connect node_1, node_2, node_3, and node_4 ultimately creating a triangular closed structure. Ensure all nodes connected with minimally sized members, selecting areas that support stress constraints. Triangular truss enables efficient force transfer, limiting tensile and compressive stress. Set areas to keep mass ≤30." ,\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Added node_4 at (2,1.5) from trial height to reduce angles and reduce stresses. Members: (n1,n3), (n2,n3), (n3,n4), (n1,n4), (n2,n4) to close structure fully. Check lengths, areas, stresses considering load -10N at 45° downward-left at node_3. Assumed uniform rectangular truss members with simple axial loading. Area to be mostly small to moderate to save mass.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Assuming static equilibrium, forces on node_3 are carried by members connected to it. By triangulating node_4 above node_3, the members share compressive and tensile stresses. Use geometry to calculate member lengths and axial forces from load components by decomposing the load and resolving forces in members with angles. Analyze forces to ensure stress in any member = force / area ≤ ±20. Mass approximated by sum of (member length × area). Allowed areas discrete from given set with mass ≤30. Maintain ties so no unstable nodes. Pinned and roller supports provide reaction forces preventing movement.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Set node_4=(2.0,1.5) assumed approx height: member lengths: n1-n3=2.0, n2-n3=4.0 on horizontal; n3-n4=1.5 vertical; n1-n4=sqrt(2^2+1.5^2)=2.5; n2-n4=sqrt((6-2)^2+1.5^2)=4.27 approx. Assign smaller areas to short members with less stress. Calculate axial force in members: decompose load (-10, -10) N with direction 45° pos x axis negative components. Use equilibrium to solve for member axial forces. Example stress = axial force/(area). Final check mass = ∑ length× area ≤ 30.",\n\n  "calculation": "1.
