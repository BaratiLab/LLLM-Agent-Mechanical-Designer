Constraints: ±20 max stress, mass ≤30. Nodes fixed at support/load. Previous designs failed mainly due to stress >20, mass ok.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Iteration 3: max stress 38.7µ—node 4 to node 1 member. Area 1 too small there. Mass 17 still okay. Problematic high stress at compression member_4. Current layout lengthens stress in diagonal members too much. We must relieve high stress by redistribution and possibly strengthen critical members with reasonable larger cross-section. Node_5 addition to try load paths was not effective, showed stress zero on members 6 and 7 meaning redundant members wasting mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Problem is stress on member from node_1 to node_4 very high due to short verticals and long diagonals. Direct diagonal ties from load to supports must be formed with optimum orientation. Need stiffer members in primary load paths, smaller or no secondary redundant members to keep mass low.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Retain support/load nodes: node_1[0,0], node_2[6,0], node_3[2,0]. Add one apex node above load: node_4 at (3.0, 2.0). Members: pinned support node_1 to node_4, roller node_2 to node_4, node_3 to node_4, node_1 to node_3, node_2 to node_3. Remove node_5 (ineffective). Assign areas to ensure max stress ±20 and minimal mass: diagonal members (node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4) area 4 (3.128), node_3-node_4 area 3 (1.759), node_1-node_3 and node_2-node_3 area 2 (0.782).",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Placing node_4 closer vertical to load at moderate elevation improves force distribution and reduces tension in member node_1,node_4 (previously oversized stress). Allow 3.128 area to keep stresses near target. Smaller area on horizontal base members reduces mass without risking stress limits as tension at base less. Direct load transfer from node_3 to apex node above improves stiffness. No redundant members to reduce mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_1-node_4 = sqrt(3^2+2^2)=3.6056, node_2-node_4=sqrt(3^2+2^2)=3.6056, node_3-node_4=sqrt(1^2+2^2)=2.236, node_1-node_3=2.0, node_2-node_3=4.0 Approximate mass=sum(length × area), expected mass=3.6056*3.128*2 + 2.236*1.759 + 2.0*0.782 + 4.0*0.782=22.58 well below 30.
