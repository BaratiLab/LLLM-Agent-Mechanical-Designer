Max stress allowed ±20 and total mass ≤ 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_4 is highly stressed (40.29 > 20 tensile). Current member areas are insufficient or the geometry concentrates stress on member_4. Total mass 17.12 is below mass limit, so enlarging smaller members or changing geometry could reduce peak stress. Node_4 above node_3 may cause high bending in member_4. Load at node_3 is diagonal downward left, diagonal force. The truss seems almost a quadrilateral with diagonal members. Key to reduce member_4 stress is either to add members to better distribute forces to supports or shift node_4 position. The load and support setup are fixed (nodes 1,2 are supports). Node_3 is loaded. Goal: redistribute forces with minimal added members and reevaluate member areas. Iteration 0 appears insufficient to reduce stress under 20 for member_4. Increase connectivity − add nodes to create triangles and/or add cross bracing.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_4 stress is tensile, overloaded at 40.29. Possibly replace member_4 with multiple shorter members or add an extra node between node_4 and supports to reduce length and stress. Member areas can be up to id 10 (=19.548). Rearrange node_4 position to reduce that member stretch. Alternatively, add node_5 above or right of node_4 to create more triangles for load path.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add a new node_5 at (4.0, 1.8), add members from node_3 and node_2 to node_5. Move member_4 subdivision: instead of node_1–node_4 we use node_1–node_5 and node_5–node_4. This improves triangulation and reduces member_4 stress. Increase areas on stressed members and reduce on underutilized ones. Select areas using the given sequence. Keep existing support and load nodes intact.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 creates additional membership paths to spread forces, reducing peak stress on old member_4. Triangles distribute loads better. Node_5 to node_2 and node_3 creates triangular substructures. Member lengths and areas adjusted according to forces. Truss is statically determinate and stable. Areas selected no larger than needed to keep mass under 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2,1.5), node_5(4,1.8). Lengths approx: (n1-n3)=2, (n2-n3)=4, (n3-n4)=1.5, (n1-n5)=√(4²+1.8²)=4.38, (n5-n4)=2, (n2-n5)=√(2²+1.8²)=2.69 and (n3-n5)=2 + 0.8=2.83 approx. Assign area ids to stressed members larger sizes (up to 7, 9 areas). Members around node_4 and node_5 also optimized. Member lengths and masses reassessed post update.",\n\n  "calculation": "Member lengths and areas: Use area_id=7(9.578) for highly stressed; area_id=3(1.759) for moderately stressed, area_id=1 (0.195) for least stressed.
