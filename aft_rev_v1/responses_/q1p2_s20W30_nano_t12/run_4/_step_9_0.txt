  "preamble": "Optimize truss nodal locations to minimize max stress while meeting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 9.95 < 20, total mass 20.99 < 30. 7 members, 5 nodes. Load on node_3; supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. Allowed to move free nodes excluding load/support nodes.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_3 has highest tensile stress (9.95), member_5 also high tensile (8.53). Compressive stresses are lower but member_7 has notable compressive stress (-9.2). Current mass is moderate. Nodes 4 and 5 govern load path between supports. Refining node_4 and node_5 positions can better distribute forces.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Lower max tensile stress focus on member_3, member_5, member_7. Slightly reduce node_5 x and y to shorten and alter force directions and node_4 y reduced for force balance.",

  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 slightly lower and closer to node_3 pads member_3 stress by shortening and changing truss angle. Move node_5 slightly left and down reduces load path length, trimming member_3 and member_5 stress and internal force. Member cross-sections uniform at area_id=2 or 3 for balance; current areas suitable as stress reduction preferable via geometry adjustment first. No major member change, focus on node relocation as required.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Distances between node_4 (2.3, 2.3) and node_3 (2.0, 0.0) is ~2.3; reducing node_4 y to 2.0 or 2.1 shortens member_2 and member_3. Node_5 (4.1,2.6) moves around (3.9,2.3) to balance force paths and reduce tension/stress peaks.",

  "calculation": "Proposed node moves: node_4: (2.3, 2.0) (down by 0.3m), node_5: (3.9, 2.3) (left and down by 0.2-0.3m). Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed for load/support. Areas unchanged (mainly 2 and 3). With shorter/more favorable truss angle members, expect member stresses to decrease and total mass to slightly reduce due to shorter member lengths but still within allowable area sizes.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Structure remains closed with all members intact. Areas intact adheres to current options. Total mass expected below 21, max stress target <9 improves preparation for next iteration. Continue since current max stress is not minimized yet.",
