Move intermediate nodes slightly upward and right to reduce bending and achieve better load transfer.

Priority: nodal repositioning to optimize geometry.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 from (2.5, 2.5) slightly upward and right can reduce compression in member_6 and tensile stress in members connected to it.
