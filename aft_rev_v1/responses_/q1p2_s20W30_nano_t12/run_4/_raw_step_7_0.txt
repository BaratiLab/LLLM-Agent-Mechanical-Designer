Existing nodes fixed for loads/supports. Areas assigned mostly medium (1, 2, 3).",\n  "analysis": "Member_6 shows highest compressive stress (-12.09) close to -20 limit. Slightly reducing stress there can improve safety margin. Mass is well below 30, so slight increase possible if it reduces stress. Nodes node_4 and node_5 can be moved to improve force flow and reduce stress concentrations.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider lowering the vertical coordinate of node_4 slightly to reduce compressive force in member_6, while adjusting node_5 for better triangulation and less stress in members 5, 6, 7. Areas seem fine, no need to upscale as that would increase mass unnecessarily.",\n  "reasoning": "Node_4 currently at (2.4, 2.85), node_5 at (4.5, 3.1). They form triangles with lower chord width (node_1, node_2 fixed at 0,0 and 6,0). Compression in member_6 is likely due to geometry and load transfer from node_4 to node_2. Reducing height of node_4 reduces bending effect and compression. Node_5 slightly forward and down can optimize load path from node_4 to node_5 and then to node_2. This improves load distribution, reduces max stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: e.g. member_6 (node_4-node_2 distance), currently about sqrt((6-2.4)^2 + (0-2.85)^2) = sqrt(3.6^2 + 2.85^2) ≈ 4.6m. Lowering node_4 y from 2.85 to about 2.5 reduces length in y direction. Try node_4 at (2.4, 2.55). Node_5 from (4.5,3.1) to (4.4, 2.85). Check topology remains closed.
