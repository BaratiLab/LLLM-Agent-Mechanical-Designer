  "preamble": "Optimization of stress reduction within mass and stress constraints for 2D truss.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective is minimizing max stress ≤ ±20 with total mass ≤30. Load on fixed node_3, supports fixed at nodes 1 and 2. Current max stress ~13.8 well within limits, mass ~19.38 within limits. Improvement possible by adjusting nodes 4, 5 while keeping load/support node fixed.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design has low mass and acceptable stress margins, but uneven stress distribution. Member_6 is max compressive, close to -13.81. Members 3 & 5 are relatively high tension ~8.2. Nodes 4 and 5 positioned to balance force paths but slight shifts may decrease stress concentrations and improve uniformity.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further vertical and lateral repositioning of node_4 closer to midpoint between nodes_1,2 horizontally but not simply linear; lower height than 2.55. Node_5 slightly leftwards and downward from 4.4, 2.85 to reduce moments on members 3,4,7. Smaller cross sections (area 1 or 2) help reduce mass, raising area for key compressive members can reduce stress.",
  
  "reasoning": "Reducing height of node_4 reduces lever arm moments around supports reducing tensile stresses on member_5 & 3. Moving node_5 closer to node_2 reduces member length for member_4, lowering mass and tension. Changing member_6 area from 1 (0.195) to 2 (0.782) to reduce max compressive stress by increasing cross-section. Shifting node_4 to (2.3, 2.3) and node_5 to (4.1, 2.6) optimizes force path without large stress increases. Keep member areas mostly at current to balance stress and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths to update: Approx... lengths L_1-3=~2.0; L_3-4 decreased slightly from ~2.86; L_4-5 decreased; L_5-2 shortened; L_4-2 moves in would lower load on member_6. Areas updated for member_6: 2, member_1:3, others as 2 or 3 per previous for balance. This redistribution expected to lower max stress ~10–12 and keep mass near current 19.3.",
  
  "calculation": "Node reposition: node_4 (2.3, 2.3), node_5 (4.1, 2.6). Member areas: member_1=3, member_2=2, member_3=2, member_4=3, member_5=2, member_6=2 (increase area to reduce compression), member_7=2. Estimated mass ~19.0–19.5 under limit 30, max stress reduced below 13. Updated nodes only move nodal 4,5 (not load/support). No duplicates in membe dict, structure remains closed thanks to member_7 retaining diagonal.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no violation of max stress ±20, mass <30, and maintain boundary nodes fixed. Reducing node_4 height and moving node_5 closer to node_2 expected to lower moment and slightly balance member stresses. Increase in member_6 area reduces max compression. Overall a more optimal solution in iterative step.",
