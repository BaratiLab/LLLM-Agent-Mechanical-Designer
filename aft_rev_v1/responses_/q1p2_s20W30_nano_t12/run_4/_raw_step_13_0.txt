Use node repositioning of free nodes (node_3, node_4, node_5) to reduce high tensile stress in member_3 and compressive stress in member_7. Areas fixed mostly at 2 or 3. Load fixed at node_3; supports at node_1 and node_2. No member topology change allowed.",\n  "analysis": "Member_3 (node_4 to node_5) has highest tensile stress 16.28; member_7 (node_3 to node_5) max compressive -16.14. These are limiters. Member_1 and member_5 have relatively high stress but below max. Move node_4 and node_5 slightly to reduce elongation in member_3 and axial load in member_7 while keeping truss stable. Minimal increase in member lengths possible to maintain mass <30. Areas are secondary optimization currently; keep areas same for now.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_3 cannot move (load node), nodes_1 and 2 fixed (supports). Node_4 is close to between node_3 and node_5; lowering node_5 slightly in y might reduce tension in member_3. Shifting node_4 slightly left and up may balance forces. Try node_4 y: 1.8 -> 1.9, node_5 y: 2.4 - 2.5. Move node_5 x left slightly from 3.7 to 3.6 to lower moment on member_3 and 7.",\n  "reasoning": "Member forces depend on axial length and angle. Reducing length elongation or direct stress paths may lower peak stress. With fixed members and mostly fixed areas, repositioning free nodes in vertical and horizontal directions is primary control. Avoid large shifts to prevent instability. Adjust node_4 y to 1.85 (a compromise), node_5 y and x to reduce member_3 and member_7 loads.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Evaluate length changes after node moves, estimate stress from load and length change. Mass: sum(length_i * area_i_density) with areas fixed as per iteration_12. Areas dictionary given lets area_id \'2\' = 0.782, \'3\' = 1.759. Mass should remain similar as length changes small.

Member_7 length from approx sqrt((3.7-2)^2+(2.45-0)^2)=4.136 to sqrt((3.6-2)^2+(2.4-0)^2)=4.132 (near constant). Slight reduction in member_3 length relieves tension.
