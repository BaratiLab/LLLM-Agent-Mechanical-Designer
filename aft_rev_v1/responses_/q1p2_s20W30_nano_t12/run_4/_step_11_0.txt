  "preamble": "Optimizing 2D truss to minimize stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current design 7 nodes originally; load at node_3, supports at node_1, node_2 fixed. Constraints: maxstress ±20, maxmass 30.",
  "analysis": "Current max stress = 14.65 under limit. Mass = 19.62 under 30. Load at node_3 = (-10, -45°). High stresses in member_3 = 14.65 (tension), and significant stresses elsewhere but safe. Nodes node_1 and node_2 fixed. Need to shift internal nodes (node_3,4,5) positions to reduce max stress. Members used with area sizes mostly 2 or 3. Previous optimization history shows stress dropped by raising node_4 and node_5 heights but still 14+ MPa max stress. Member_3 stress high indicating member_4-5 needs relief. Explore increasing vertical distance between node_4 and node_5 and adjusting horizontal position adversely affecting mass but hopefully reducing stress. Keep areas same or possibly optimize cross-sectional areas where possible without increasing mass beyond limit.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider shifting node_5 closer vertically above load node_3 but raised higher horizontally by 0.3-0.4 m to improve load path. Slightly reduce node_4 vertical position from 2.1 to ~1.9 to ease force redistribution. Maintain triangular shape closures; important the closed loop remains.",
  "reasoning": "Increasing height difference between node_5 and node_4 can better distribute compression in member_3 and reduce tensile stress. Slightly moving node_3 horizontally constrained to fixed load position. Review areas - reducing larger area in heavy stressed members would reduce mass but risks stress increase; better here to keep or slightly increase area in highest tension member. Keep shortest member area small to reduce mass. Member length and mass recalculation confirms stays below max. Target max stress closer to ~12 MPa safely below 20 limit, trading marginal increase in mass if needed.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Areas used: member_1=3 (1.759), member_2=2, member_3=2, member_4=3, member_5=2, member_6=2, member_7=2. Mass formula: ∑length_i * area_value_i. Aiming to keep total mass ~20.",
  "calculation": "Node changes: node_4 from (2.3, 2.1) to (2.35, 1.9); node_5 from (3.75, 2.1) to (4.0, 2.65). This slightly increases vertical spacing and horizontal spacing, maintaining closure. Members same, areas same. Approximate member lengths: m3 ~ distance node_4-node_5 ~ sqrt((0.65)^2+(0.75)^2)=0.992 m; previous length ~ distance sqrt((1.35)^2+(0)^2)=1.35 m - actually reduced length reduces mass and stress. Mass of member 3 = length*area ≈0.992 *0.782= 0.775 kg (before was 1.1339, so mass reduces here). Check overall design consistency and if mass <30 and all close. By raising node_5, the force producing member_3 tension reduces and member_5 shifts to less stress. Overall expect max_stress to reduce to ~12.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Revised node coords for internal nodes only; loads/supports fixed. Members connections unchanged per instructions. Confirm no duplicates, closed truss maintained. Final estimated mass will be ~19.5-20. Max stress below 15 expected. Continue optimization not stopped as slight margin remains to further reduce stress next iterations.",
