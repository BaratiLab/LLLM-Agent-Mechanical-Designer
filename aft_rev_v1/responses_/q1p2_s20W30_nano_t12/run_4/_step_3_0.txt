  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under point load with supports to respect stress ±20 and total mass ≤30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 22.59 > 20 and mass 17.21 < 30. Reduce stress on member_7 (22.59). Load at node_3 downward-left. Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2 fixed.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_7 (node_1-node_4) has max tensile stress slightly above limit, area currently small (1). Increased stiffness required to reduce stress possibly by adding bracing and redistributing load. Node_4 too close to node_3 (short members cause high stress concentration). Member_6 and member_7 areas also small. Slightly reposition intermediate nodes to improve load paths. The upper triangular configuration supports vertical forces; horizontal load has to be transferred efficiently to supports.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try moving node_4 higher and slightly to the left, add a direct diagonal from node_3 to node_5 to provide load path reducing stress in member_7. Increase areas in critical members where stress is high but keep overall mass <30 by reducing area on less stressed members.",

  "proposal": "Add new member from node_3 to node_5. Reposition node_4 from (2.4, 2.0) to approx (1.9, 2.2) to improve triangulation and load path. Node_6 moved from (1.8, 3.0) to (1.7, 3.1) to preserve triangle shape but reduce stress. node_5 kept at (3.5, 3.5). Set areas intelligently: members in high stress get larger area ids: 5-6; low stress get smaller areas 1-2.",
  
  "reasoning": "By adjusting node_4 toward pinned support and adding member_3-to-node_5 diagonal, we create multiple load paths reducing local stresses. Increasing cross-sectional areas in loaded members balances stress and keeps mass within constraints. The new shape spreads loads and reduces peak stress on member_7. The pinned and roller supports allow horizontal and vertical force resolution. Keep node_1 and node_2 fixed-position per instructions.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Area mapping { '0':1, '1':0.195, '2':0.782, '3':1.759,...}. Stress boundary ±20. Need total mass ≤30. Member length × area to be summed. Approximate member lengths recalculated for mass and stress contribution.",
