  "preamble": "Optimize node positions to minimize max stress while adhering to constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress is 13.1 < 20 limit, mass 20.35 < 30 max mass. Load at node_3 and supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. Nodes allowed to move: node_4, node_5.",
  "analysis": "Current structure is feasible within constraints. Highest stresses are on member_3 (13.1), member_1 (-7.17), member_7 (-12.68), and member_5 (9.3). To balance stress, adjust nodes 4 and 5 positions closer together vertically for better force distribution. Member areas mostly uniform (mostly area_id '2' and '3'). Increasing some cross sections could reduce stress but increase mass - better to optimize geometry first.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Aim to slightly lower node_4 y coordinate from 2.0 to around 1.8-1.9, node_5 y from 2.55 to ~2.2-2.3. This shortens member_3 reducing tension and reallocates stress reducing max stress. Keep nodes x coordinates close to current to preserve stability. Use current member areas, no need to alter that at this stage.",
  "reasoning": "Stress minimization through better geometry and load path. Lowering height of node_4 reduces moment arm on member_3, reducing max stress. Reduced span to node_5 decreases tension and stress on members connecting node_5. No support or load node moved per constraints, meeting instructions.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length approximately recalculated with new node_4 at (2.35,1.85) and node_5 at (3.8,2.2). Expect mass increment negligible or slight reduction due to smaller length of high stress member_3. Stress reduction expected on max stressed members.",
  "calculation": "Moved node_4 from (2.35,2.0) to (2.35,1.85), node_5 from (3.8,2.55) to (3.8,2.22). Kept members and areas same. Estimated member_3 length reduced ~ (delta y from 0.55 to 0.37), reducing length and stress. Total mass expected ~20 is maintained, max stress expected less than current 13.1 MPa. No upper bound stress limits violated.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Adjustment meets constraints, reduces max stress, mass remains within limit. No area changes made to avoid mass increase. Geometry optimized while respecting constraints and instruction to preserve load/support nodes. Further steps could tweak areas but current design sufficiently optimal for iteration 14/25.",
