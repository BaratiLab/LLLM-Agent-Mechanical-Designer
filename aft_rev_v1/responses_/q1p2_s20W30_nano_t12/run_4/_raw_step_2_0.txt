Supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller). Existing nodes mostly on baseline plus nodes 4, 5 elevated. Current design mass 34.6 (>30) and max stress 89.24 (>20).",\n  "analysis": "Current design has overstressing and excess mass mainly from heavy members with large cross-sections. Excessively stressed member_7 and member_6; large areas cause heavy mass. Shape irregularities cause high tensile/compression forces. Connection pattern allows long members causing higher moments and stress. Load at node_3 induces complex force paths.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress, create stiffer triangulated topology with shorter members to distribute loads. Remove existing member_7 which is heavily stressed. Reduce member areas where possible. Reposition intermediate nodes (allowed to add/move except load/support nodes) for geometry optimization. Consider stable simple triangle forms around load to carry forces efficiently.",\n  "proposal": "Remove \'member_7\'. Adjust node_4 location to reduce member length and stress concentration. Add new node_6 above node_3 for better triangulation. Change area assignments to ensure members have minimal adequate areas (<4.0, preferably) to reduce mass. Members longer than ~3 units reduce area sizes. Ultimate structure: nodes = 1 (0,0)pinned, 2 (6,0)roller, 3(2,0) load, 4 (~2.4,2.0), 5 (~3.5,3.5), 6 (~1.8,3.0) new node. Members arranged as triangular patterns between supports, load, and new nodes. Area IDs mostly between 1 and 3 to limit mass and stresses.",\n  "reasoning": "Triangles provide structural stability. Shorter members reduce bending stress and increase axial force efficiency. Moving node_4 lower to about y=2 reduces member_{4,5} length and mass. Adding node_6 above node_3 allows alternative force path mitigating load effects on heavily stressed members. Use small area cross-sections combined with topology optimization reduces total mass and maximum stress. Avoid member crossings and duplicate members. Supports fixed by problem statement at nodes 1 and 2. Load node_3 position unchanged.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculated member lengths estimated by distance formula. Use volume = length × area ID for mass estimate. Stress roughly inversely proportional to area and proportional to force, force depends on load distribution and geometry.
