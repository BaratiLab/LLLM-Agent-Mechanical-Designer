  "preamble": "Optimize node positions to reduce peak member stresses, keeping mass and stress within allowable range.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress is 16.28 < 20; mass 19.74 < 30. Use node repositioning of free nodes (node_3, node_4, node_5) to reduce high tensile stress in member_3 and compressive stress in member_7. Areas fixed mostly at 2 or 3. Load fixed at node_3; supports at node_1 and node_2. No member topology change allowed.",
  "analysis": "Member_3 (node_4 to node_5) has highest tensile stress 16.28; member_7 (node_3 to node_5) max compressive -16.14. These are limiters. Member_1 and member_5 have relatively high stress but below max. Move node_4 and node_5 slightly to reduce elongation in member_3 and axial load in member_7 while keeping truss stable. Minimal increase in member lengths possible to maintain mass <30. Areas are secondary optimization currently; keep areas same for now.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_3 cannot move (load node), nodes_1 and 2 fixed (supports). Node_4 is close to between node_3 and node_5; lowering node_5 slightly in y might reduce tension in member_3. Shifting node_4 slightly left and up may balance forces. Try node_4 y: 1.8 -> 1.9, node_5 y: 2.4 - 2.5. Move node_5 x left slightly from 3.7 to 3.6 to lower moment on member_3 and 7.",
  "reasoning": "Member forces depend on axial length and angle. Reducing length elongation or direct stress paths may lower peak stress. With fixed members and mostly fixed areas, repositioning free nodes in vertical and horizontal directions is primary control. Avoid large shifts to prevent instability. Adjust node_4 y to 1.85 (a compromise), node_5 y and x to reduce member_3 and member_7 loads.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Evaluate length changes after node moves, estimate stress from load and length change. Mass: sum(length_i * area_i_density) with areas fixed as per iteration_12. Areas dictionary given lets area_id '2' = 0.782, '3' = 1.759. Mass should remain similar as length changes small. Stress should reduce based on trial displacement.",
  "calculation": "Set node_4: from (2.35,1.7) to (2.35,1.85), node_5: from (3.7,2.45) to (3.6,2.4). Compute member length change roughly: member_3 length reduced from approx sqrt((3.7-2.35)^2+(2.45-1.7)^2)=1.588 to sqrt((3.6-2.35)^2+(2.4-1.85)^2)=1.381 (a reduction). Member_7 length from approx sqrt((3.7-2)^2+(2.45-0)^2)=4.136 to sqrt((3.6-2)^2+(2.4-0)^2)=4.132 (near constant). Slight reduction in member_3 length relieves tension. Expect member_3 stress decrease by ~10-15%, similarly member_7 by small amount. Mass approx below 20 still. Max stress estimate reduces from 16.28 to about 14.5-15 range.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Moved node_4 upward vertically by 0.15 units, node_5 left 0.1 units horizontally and down 0.05 units, expecting tensile stress on member_3 and compressive on member_7 to reduce. Areas kept from iteration_12 to maintain mass and ensure compliance. Members and nodal numbering unchanged. Constraints remain met. This iteration aims to improve stress distribution. Stop if stress reduction is marginal or no improvement seen next iterations.",
