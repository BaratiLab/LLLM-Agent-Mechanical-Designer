  "preamble": "Optimize node positions to further reduce stresses within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 12.72 < 20, total mass 20.4634 < 30. Load at node_3 fixed, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Adjust node_4 and node_5 positions only. Use current member areas.",
  
  "analysis": "Current max stress mostly on member_3 (12.53 tension) and member_7 (-12.72 compression). Slight imbalance in force path can be improved by relocating nodes 4 and 5 to better distribute forces and reduce stress peaks.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Move node_4 slightly down to reduce tensile stress on member_3. Move node_5 slightly left to shorten long members reducing mass and stress. Maintain connectivity and avoid increased eccentricity to control buckling. Areas appear optimal for now.",
  
  "reasoning": "Lowering node_4 y will reduce tensile force in member_3 by horizontalizing the member_3 segment. Slight left shift of node_5 reduces member_5 length which has high tension (9.6) and member_4 length reducing compression stress potential. This redistribution should lower max stresses. Areas will remain the same as changing areas may increase mass or stress.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths calculation needed:# original length member_3 = dist(node_4,node_5) ~ sqrt((4-2.35)^2 + (2.65-1.9)^2)=~1.78; move node_4 y down ~0.15-0.2, move node_5 x left ~0.3, y slightly down 0.2, new length decreases slightly. Stress reduction expected proportional to length change given load fixed. Acceptable safe shifts within geometry.",
  "calculation": "Node_4 moves (2.35,1.7), node_5 moves (3.7,2.45). New member lengths smaller or similar: member_3 length ~ sqrt((3.7-2.35)^2+(2.45-1.7)^2) ~ 1.58, reduced 0.2 length. Member_5 length sqrt((3.7-0)^2+(2.45-0)^2) ~ 4.38 less than before (~4.69). Mass and stress expected to reduce slightly for heavy members. Member areas unchanged. Max stress predicted below 12, total mass ~20.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Check no violation: max stress low, total mass under 30; nodes for load/support fixed; no duplicate members. Only moved allowed nodes. Continue optimization with these changes.",
