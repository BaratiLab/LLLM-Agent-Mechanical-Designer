Load at node_3 fixed; supports at node_1, node_2 stay fixed. Node_4, node_5 free to relocate and optimize geometry.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure meets constraints with comfortable margin on mass and stress. Max stress still mostly in member_3 at node_4-to-node_5 connection (Tension). Adjusting node_4 and node_5 positions might reduce stress concentration and improve load distribution. Member areas look judicious; leave areas unchanged for now to minimize mass increase.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress in member_3 high but acceptable. Possibly better force flow via altering node_4 lower (reduce height) might relieve tension and reduce peak stress. Decrease node_5 y coordinate to reduce member_3 length and peak stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Allow minor downward shift of node_4 and node_5 within limits so truss shape is more triangular than peak-shaped, reducing bending and tension peaks. Node_4 currently at (2.35,1.85), node_5 at (3.8,2.22). We try y values smaller, still stabilizing geometry but reducing tension in diagonal member_3. Keep x positions stable to maintain horizontal cover and crisp load transfer.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "New node_4 y in [1.5-1.85], New node_5 y in [1.9-2.2] to be tested. Calculate member lengths for member_3 = (node_4 to node_5 length), approx shorter length lowers stress. Keep areas steady: member_1,4 areas=3; others=2 except member_6 whose stress is moderate. Validate new lengths and estimate mass approx 19.0-19.5. Peak stress target lower than 14.2.",\n\n  "calculation": "Shift node_4 to (2.35,1.65) lowering 0.2 from current 1.85; node_5 to (3.8,2.00) lowering 0.22. Length member_3: sqrt((3.8-2.35)^2 + (2.00-1.65)^2) â‰ˆ sqrt(1.45^2 + 0.35^2)=1.49 vs old 1.65. Reduced length reduces tension. Anticipate member_3 stress drop ~10%. Member_2 stress favorable already. No area change preserves mass ~19.4.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "New positions superior for stress but still conservative to not move load/support nodes or change topology. Areas unchanged for minimal mass impact and assembly consistency. Updating just y-coordinate of node_4 and node_5 reduces tension star in member_3 from 14.2 towards ~12.9 approx.
