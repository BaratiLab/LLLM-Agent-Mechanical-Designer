Need to reduce stresses on members 3 and 4 mostly.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Load at node_3 downward-left (-10 N, -45°). Supports pinned node_1 and roller node_2. Existing nodes: 1 & 2 fixed. Node_4 elevated at 2.5 m. Current members show member_4 over-stressed (30.96). Slight mass budget left but stress constraints drive design. Better load path needed from node_3 load to supports via stiffer diagonals and verticals.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "High stresses on member_4 and member_3 indicate poor load transfer. Adding a node higher and relocating node_4 upwards increased member leverage but cross-section areas low for high tensile demand. Need larger area on critical compression/tension members and possibly an added node for better triangulation.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Keep nodes_1,2,3 fixed. Add new node, node_5, above node_4 to improve load path. Move node_4 slightly right for improved geometry (original y=2.5 → 2.7, x=2.20). Place node_5 at (3.1, 4.05). Connect members for triangularization: node_3-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_5, node_1-node_3. Increase area sizes on highly stressed members effectively: area ids mostly 4 or 5 for members with high force, others smaller.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Additional node above current top node redistributes load, converts member_4 stress from tension to less extreme, adds a force path from upper load point reducing bending in lower chords. Enlarged member cross sections on critical members reduce stresses below ±20. Triangulated layout and maintaining support locations keep structural integrity.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assess lengths, areas, assumed stresses: members from load node_3 to new node_5 path distributes 10N load.
