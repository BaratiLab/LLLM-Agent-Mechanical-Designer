  "preamble": "Optimize stress with nodal adjustments within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress ~15.75 < 20, mass 19.82 < 30. Loaded node fixed; optimize mid nodes for stress.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress lies on member_3 (15.75) and member_7 (-14.97), large compressive and tensile stresses respectively. Stress distribution generally good, but member_3 close to max tensile stress limit. Node_5 appears to cause concentration. Mass is safe. Load is only at node_3, fixed nodes at ends.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Idea: soften stress cluster by slightly relocating nodes 4 and 5 to better distribute loads; consider increasing node_4 y-coordinate slightly with adjustments to node_5 to reduce peak stresses in member_3 and member_7.",
  
  "reasoning": "Members with highest stresses are connected to node_5 and node_4. Minor vertical upward shift of node_4 might straighten force paths, limiting bending and shear effect. Node_5 can also move rightward and slightly upward to reduce tension in member_7 and tension in member_3. Maintain connectivity and existing member set to ensure closed truss and constraints. Areas remain as current, as changing cross-section not instructed and fixed by input. Equilibrium should be preserved based on nodal shift.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_3 fixed: (2.0, 0.0). Supports node_1 (0,0) and node_2 (6,0) fixed. Move node_4 (2.35,1.85) slightly up to (2.35,2.0) and node_5 (3.6,2.4) to (3.8,2.55). Pressure/stress calculated based on member lengths and force transfer assuming linear behavior.",
  
  "calculation": "Current member lengths approx:\n member_3 (node_4-node_5): sqrt((3.6-2.35)^2 + (2.4-1.85)^2) = ~1.36\n Increased to sqrt((3.8-2.35)^2 + (2.55-2.0)^2) ~1.52, longer members reduce stress for same force.\n Shifting node_4 up increases truss height to better resist bending.\n Stress reduction expected in member_3 and member_7 due to this geometry.\n Mass expected slightly increased (longer member_3) but still well within limits.\n Re-calculate mass based on new lengths and same area ids:\n Approximate member lengths:\n member_1 (node_1-node_3): 2.0 (unchanged)\n member_2 (node_3-node_4): sqrt((2.35-2.0)^2+(2.0-0)^2)=~2.05\n member_3 (node_4-node_5): ~1.52\n member_4: (3.8,2.55) to (6,0): sqrt(2.2^2+2.55^2)=~3.39\n member_5 (node_1-node_4): sqrt(2.35^2+2.0^2)=~3.08\n member_6 (node_4-node_2): sqrt((6-2.35)^2+2^2)= ~4.13\n member_7 (node_3-node_5): sqrt((3.8-2)^2+(2.55-0)^2)= ~3.29\n Sum areas times lengths is below mass limit.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Expected max stress < 15, mass < 21 appropriate. Nodes adjusted respecting load and support fixed positions and member connectivity horizontal stability. No duplicate nodes, members consistent. Suggest next iteration with close monitoring max stress and total mass. Not yet stopping as stress could still be lowered marginally.",
