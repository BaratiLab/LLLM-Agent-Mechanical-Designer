  "preamble": "Optimizing 2D truss to minimize max stress under given constraints with fixed supports/load nodes.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max stress ±20, mass ≤30. Load at node_3. Supports fixed. Current max stress = 12.46 well below limit, mass = 19.8564 below threshold. Aim: Further reduce max stress while preserving constraints.",
  
  "analysis": "Current structure has uniform areas mostly 2 or 3 with moderate size. The maximum tensile stress (member_3) is 12.46 (allowed up to 20). Compressive stresses are also within limit. Mass is below max 30. Slight reductions in max stress possible by adjusting intermediate nodes to reduce stress concentrations and possibly mass. No duplication in nodes or members.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Members with highest stress are member_3 (tension 12.46) and member_7 (compression about -10.7). Member lengths and orientation indicate node_5 is shifted left (3.9, 2.3) from prior (4.1,2.6). Slight lowering of node_4 from (2.3,2.3) to (2.3,2.0) reduced stress but room to improve.",
  
  "reasoning": "To minimize max stress and mass, shift node_5 slightly closer to node_4 to reduce loading in member_3 and 7. Small adjustments on node_4 vertical and horizontal possible to balance forces. Keep node_1,2,3 fixed (support and load nodes). Retain same topology since structure is already closed and continuous. Adjust cross section area sizes if needed but current moderate 2 and 3 seem balanced with stress. Decreasing member_3 area might increase stress, so cautious about changes to member areas.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "No area changes proposed to reduce complexity. Node changes: move node_5 slightly to (3.75, 2.1) to shorten and reduce stress. Slightly increase node_4 y to 2.1 from 2.0 to reduce force imbalance. Calculate member lengths and estimate effect on stresses accordingly. Members affected: member_3 and member_7 reduce length and stress, balancing forces reduce compressive peak on member_6.",
  
  "calculation": "Recalculated approximate lengths after node changes: member_3 length ≈ sqrt((3.75-2.3)^2+(2.1-2)^2)=~1.46 reduced from ~1.52; member_7 length ≈ sqrt((3.75-2)^2+(2.1-0)^2)=~2.05 reduced from ~2.46; Expected reduction in stress magnitudes proportional to member length reduction and improved force path. Mass reduces slightly as member_7 length shortens, expect total mass ~ 19.5 (below 20). Max stress expected ≤ 11. Balanced update should lower tensile max stress and compressive peaks.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify new positions do not violate node restrictions (supports and load fixed). Check no duplicate members. Cross sections remain area '2' or '3' as before to maintain stress/ms balance. Resulting structure remains closed with 7 members connecting 5 nodes. Will resume iteration until convergence or max iteration passes. Stop = False since small improvements possible.",
