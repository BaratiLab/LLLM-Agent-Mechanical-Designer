The max tensile stress is in member_3 at ~15.76, below 20. The mass margin is sufficient for resizing. The truss is stable and closed with the member topology provided. Reduced cross-sectional areas on members under low stress could further reduce mass, but stress minimization is priority here.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_3 and member_5 have the highest tensile stresses. Compression in member_7 also notable. Small y-decrease of node_4 and node_5 reduces stresses from prior iterations.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Further large improvement unlikely by node movements since non-load and non-support nodes (node_4 and node_5) optimized around 2.35-1.65 and 3.8-2.0 respectively. Cross-sectional areas are kept minimal to sustain the design and stress limits. To minimize stress, topology change needed, but limited by closed structure and constraints. Mass limit unused, indicating room to increase area if fatigue or factor of safety considered, but current objective to reduce stress within constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member IDs and areas: member_1 area 3, member_4 area 3, others mostly area 2, member_2 area 2. Stress values moderate; revising nodal y slightly reduces max stresses compared to past iteration 15. FEM shows stability.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Length and area product mass sums to 18.7 less than limit 30.  Max stresses all below ±20. Attempts to shift node_4 or node_5 in last iterations gave max stress ~13–16 but not below 13. Node movements constrained. Best current design achieved without exceeding stress mass limits. Member cross-section sizing reasonable given stresses - no low stress members for area decrease.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "No violations of constraints: stop optimization at iteration 16.
