Stress distribution generally good, but member_3 close to max tensile stress limit. Node_5 appears to cause concentration. Mass is safe.

Minor vertical upward shift of node_4 might straighten force paths, limiting bending and shear effect. Node_5 can also move rightward and slightly upward to reduce tension in member_7 and tension in member_3. Maintain connectivity and existing member set to ensure closed truss and constraints.
