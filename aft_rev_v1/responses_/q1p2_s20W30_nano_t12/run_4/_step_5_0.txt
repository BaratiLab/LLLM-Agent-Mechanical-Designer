  "preamble": "Optimize truss node positions and areas to reduce max stress within allowed constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 18.91 close to limit 20, total mass 18.8853 < 30 max. Some members (member_6 at -18.91) near max compressive stress. Load node_3 fixed at (2,0), supports fixed.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_6 has highest compressive stress (-18.91) near limit. Members near supports carry high stress. Load at node_3 is at bottom chord. Elevating upper nodes can improve stress distribution. Existing design well under mass limit, allowing small thickening or repositioning.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing compressive stress in member_6 and tensile stress in members_3 and_5. Move intermediate nodes slightly upward and right to reduce bending and achieve better load transfer. Possibly increase area for critical compression member (member_6) ID 1 sized small, increasing to area ID 2 (0.782) or 3 (1.759) reduces stress but increases mass. Priority: nodal repositioning to optimize geometry.",
  
  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 from (2.5, 2.5) slightly upward and right can reduce compression in member_6 and tensile stress in members connected to it. Similarly moving node_5 up and slightly right reduces bending in members 3 & 5. All load/support nodes fixed. Member_6 area currently 1(0.195). Increase to 2(0.782) should be mass-acceptable. Member areas 3 and 2 for key members optimized without mass penalty exceeding limit.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Check mass: increment on area for member_6 increases mass by length(member_6) * (0.782 - 0.195). Member_6 length approx distance from node_4(2.5,2.5)->node_2(6,0) ~ calculated.\nLength = sqrt((6-2.5)^2 + (0-2.5)^2) = sqrt(3.5^2+2.5^2)= sqrt(12.25+6.25)= sqrt(18.5)=4.3m approx. Mass increment = 4.3*(0.782-0.195)=4.3*0.587=2.52 units mass.\nNew mass ~21.4 <30 still allowed. Strategic nodal reposition improves stress further.",
  
  "calculation": "New node_4 proposed ~ thrust up to (2.6,2.75) from (2.5, 2.5).\nNew node_5 proposed ~ move slightly right-up from (4.2, 2.7) to (4.4,2.9).\nMember_6 area increased 1->2 (from 0.195 to 0.782).\nMaintain node_3=(2,0), node_1=(0,0), node_2=(6,0).\nMembers adjusted only for loft to improve load paths.\nEstimate decreased bending and stresses in member_6 and adjacent members by improved geometry.\nTotal mass ~21.4 acceptable.\nExpect max stress < current 18.91 by improved load path.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Nodes repositioned to refine high compression branch.\nArea upgrade prudent only for compression critical member_6.\nOther member areas unchanged to save mass.\nConstraints checked:\n- Max stress < 20 estimated achieved.\n- Mass < 30.\n- Load/support nodes fixed.\n- No duplicates.\nStop condition not met: potential stress lowering remains.",
