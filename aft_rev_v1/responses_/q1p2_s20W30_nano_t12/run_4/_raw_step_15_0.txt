Load at node_3 and supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. Nodes allowed to move: node_4, node_5.",\n  "analysis": "Current structure is feasible within constraints. Highest stresses are on member_3 (13.1), member_1 (-7.17), member_7 (-12.68), and member_5 (9.3). To balance stress, adjust nodes 4 and 5 positions closer together vertically for better force distribution. Member areas mostly uniform (mostly area_id \'2\' and \'3\'). Increasing some cross sections could reduce stress but increase mass - better to optimize geometry first.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Aim to slightly lower node_4 y coordinate from 2.0 to around 1.8-1.9, node_5 y from 2.55 to ~2.2-2.3. This shortens member_3 reducing tension and reallocates stress reducing max stress. Keep nodes x coordinates close to current to preserve stability. Use current member areas, no need to alter that at this stage.",\n  "reasoning": "Stress minimization through better geometry and load path. Lowering height of node_4 reduces moment arm on member_3, reducing max stress. Reduced span to node_5 decreases tension and stress on members connecting node_5.

Estimated member_3 length reduced ~ (delta y from 0.55 to 0.37), reducing length and stress. Total mass expected ~20 is maintained, max stress expected less than current 13.1 MPa. No upper bound stress limits violated.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Adjustment meets constraints, reduces max stress, mass remains within limit. No area changes made to avoid mass increase.
