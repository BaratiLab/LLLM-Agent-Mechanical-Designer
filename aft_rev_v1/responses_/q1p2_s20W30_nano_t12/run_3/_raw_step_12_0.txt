Current max stress 117.57 exceeds ±20. Mass 13.55 < 30 (OK). Need to reduce max stress and distribute forces efficiently with minimal mass increase.",\n  "analysis": "Current design stressed beyond constraints on members 4 and 7 with high compressive stress (~117). Area of some presence are possibly undersized, and node location may limit effective force path. Existing load/support nodes fixed; node_4 and node_6 locations adjustable; could add one strategically placed node to improve load path and reduce stress concentrations. Member area choices biased toward mid-range, but some large stresses suggest re-assigning areas and member layout to spread forces.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce stress on member_7 by removing connection \'node_4\'-\'node_2\' - short length & high stress. Replace with alternative load transfer path. Increase area on some compression members directly loaded. Slightly raise node_4 elevation to enhance vertical force transfer.",\n  "proposal": "Nodes: Keep node 1,2,3 fixed; keep node_6 (4.0, 1.5). Move node_4 up to (2.5, 2.5) to steepen diagonal. Add node_5 at (3.5, 2.0). Modify members to remove \'node_4\'-\'node_2\' (member_7). Connect node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_5-node_6 for better force path. Assign cross-sectional areas with emphasis on tensile/compression balance and keeping mass low: use mid area (1 or 2) on main tension members and small on auxiliary.",\n  "reasoning": "Removing stressed member_7 avoids overload on node_4 to node_2 direct connection. Adding node_5 creates a triangular force path, reducing moment arm and compressive/tension peaks. Relocating node_4 upwards increases vertical component of diagonal brace, aiding stress distribution. Mid-area selections maintain mass under limit. Member layout aligns with classical two-triangle truss approach reducing bending. This configuration balances forces reducing max stress to < ±20, while total mass expected to remain below 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Members needed: node_1 to node_3, node_1 to node_4, node_3 to node_6, node_4 to node_6, node_4 to node_5, node_5 to node_2, node_6 to node_2.
