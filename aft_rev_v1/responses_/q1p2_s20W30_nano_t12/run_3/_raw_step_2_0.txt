Supports fixed at nodes 1 (pinned), 2 (roller). Previous design too heavy (>30 mass) though stresses are low.",\n    "analysis": "Current mass 47.8 exceeds 30 max allowed. Stress is well within limits (max 4.36 <20). Large member areas cause heavy mass especially members 3,4,5,6. Node_5 added in last iteration for stiffness but minimal stressed (0). Geometry is simple but heavy due to large cross-sections used. Member_2 has zero area (1) but is long (~4m) contributes to mass increasing total. Load applied on node_3 but node_3 is on bottom chord which is suitable for compression/tension transfer but member choices are suboptimal. Plan: reduce overall member areas, redesign topology to minimize length of heavy members and eliminate unnecessary nodes.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Member_3 and member_4 both have zero stress, may be removed or replaced with lighter/more direct members. Node_5 is high in y (3.5), adding too much member length and mass. Simplify truss by removing node_5 and rely on triangular truss forms near node_3 and node_4. Also consider adding diagonal bracing between node_1, node_3, node_4 and node_2 to improve load path and reduce required member sizes.",\n    "proposal": "Remove node_5. Keep nodes 1,2,3,4. Establish triangle between node_1, node_3, node_4 and diagonal from node_4 to node_2. Use members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4. Select smaller areas (1 to 3) for each to limit mass. Avoid any zero-area members. Minor repositioning not allowed for supports or load nodes, node_3 on bottom chord is optimal. Optimally assign areas as follows: main bottom chords medium area (~1), diagonals larger (3), vertical supports minimum necessary (1).",\n    "reasoning": "Removing node_5 reduces total member length and mass. Limiting cross-sectional areas reduces large mass contributions from very thick members assigned in previous solution. Triangular topology ensures load transfers through axial members, avoiding bending and distributing stresses within limits. Member selection area corresponds to \'area_id\' from input table. Member lengths verified and areas minimized to total mass below 30 and max stress below 20. Maintain pin and roller supports stationary as required to keep problem constraints consistency.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member length:\\n - node_1-node_3: |(2.0-0,0-0)|=2.0\\n - node_3-node_2: |(6.0-2.0,0-0)|=4.0\\n - node_1-node_4: |(2-0,2-0)|=2.828\\n - node_4-node_2: |(6-2,0-2)|=4.472\\n - node_3-node_4: |(2-2,2-0)|=2.0\\nEstimate mass with area: use {\'0\':1, \'1\':0.195, \'2\':0.782,\'3\':1.759,\'4\':3.128,\'5\':4.887,\'6\':7.037}.
