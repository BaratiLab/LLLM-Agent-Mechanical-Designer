Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Max stress 36.18 above 20 limit. Current design mass 11.1391 under 30 but stress constraint violated at member_4 (36.18). Need to reduce stress especially in member_4.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_4 from node_1 to node_4 with stress 36.18 exceeds allowable 20. The design has compressive and tensile stresses surpassing ±20, especially in diagonals. Buckling or improper load distribution could cause it. The geometry needs rerouting the force to reduce stress concentrations. Increasing cross-sections selectively or redistributing the truss geometry can help.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding or relocating nodes to create more effective triangular load paths advisable. Reduce length on high-stress members and add triangulation. Avoid increasing mass beyond 30. Considering node_5 moved or deleted. Use tighter areas on high stress members and smaller members on less stressed ones. Member_4 area currently \'1\' (0.195) which gave too high stress; need to increase area or reduce force demand by geometry change.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_5; add new node_6 at (4.0, 1.5) to improve load path between node_3 and node_2. Use members forming two triangles: node_1-node_4-node_3 and node_3-node_6-node_2 to better distribute forces. Select cross-section areas increasing on critical members but keeping overall mass below 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "By moving the upper node inward and lower in height, we shorten members under bending and improve force flow. Using stiffer members for critical load paths decreases stress. By removing elongated members like member_5 in iteration_3 which had area 3 giving high stress, mass reduces. Using diagonal from node_4 to node_3 keeps triangulation with shorter cables reducing stress in node_4 based members.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check lengths and areas:\\n- member_1: node_1-node_3, length = 2.0 m\\n- member_4: node_1-node_4, length = 2.0 m\\n- member_6 new: node_4-node_3, length = sqrt((2-2)^2+(2-0)^2) = 2.0 m\\n- member_2: node_3-node_6, length = sqrt((4-2)^2 + (1.5-0)^2) = 2.5 m approx\\n- member_3: node_6-node_2, length = sqrt((6-4)^2 + (0-1.5)^2) = 2.5 m approx\\n Sum lengths multiplied by area should be < 30.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Assign areas:\\n- member_1: \'2\' = 0.782 area\\n- member_4: increased to \'3\' = 1.759 area\\n- member_6 (node_4-node_3): \'1\' = 0.195 area\\n- member_2 and member_3: \'2\' = 0.782 area\\n\\nMass approx = sum(length*area)=\\nmember_1: 2*0.782=1.564\\nmember_4: 2*1.759=3.518\\nmember_6: 2*0.195=0.39\\nmember_2: 2.5*0.782=1.955\\nmember_3: 2.5*0.782=1.955\\nTotal = 9.382 < 30\\nStress estimated reduced for member_4 given larger section & better force path.
