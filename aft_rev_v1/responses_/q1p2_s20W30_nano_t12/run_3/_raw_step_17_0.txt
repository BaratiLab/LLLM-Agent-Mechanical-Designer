Load/support nodes are fixed, and no member exceeds stress limits.",\n  "analysis": "Stress is already well below ±20 (max 15.13) and total mass is 22.28 which is less than 30. The truss is closed, stable considering supports, and no elements show excessive stress. Current member areas balance load distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Potential refinements by minor node repositioning could slightly reduce stress or mass, but returns are diminishing given current stress/mass margins.",\n  "reasoning": "Since max stress is 15.13 well within limit ±20, and total mass is 22.28 less than max 30, the solution is operationally safe and mass efficient. Existing members use area IDs within allowed set and no duplication violations. Moving non-load/support nodes already minimized stress efficiently. History shows prior attempts to relocate nodes or adjust topology led to higher stress spikes. Further lowering of stress would require larger mass or redesign beyond scope.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Verified nodal positions keep \'node_1\' and \'node_2\' fixed as supports. Load applied at node_3 aligns with structural stresses observed. Member area selections from available discrete set achieve a balanced force/stress distribution, minimizing material use while keeping structure robust.",\n  "calculation": "No further changes necessary as max stress and mass constraints remain satisfied. All members carry stresses within allowable limits, reducing chance of failure or excessive deflection. Closing the truss with existing connections satisfies geometric stability requirements. Mass of 22.28 yielding max stress 15.13 is near optimal tradeoff given discrete area sizing.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Confident that current configuration is optimized for given constraints and objectives. Optimization reached a stable point with no further significant benefits on penalty function by shifting nodes. Performance checks validate stress and mass compliance.
