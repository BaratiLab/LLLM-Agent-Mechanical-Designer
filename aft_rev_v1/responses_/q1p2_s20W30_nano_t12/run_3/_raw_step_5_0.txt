Current structure has max compressive stress overly exceeded. Mass is within limit. Need to reduce member_6 compressive stress from -28.23 to ≤-20 and redistribute forces with better triangulation and appropriate cross-section areas.",\n  "analysis": "Member_6 (\'node_4\'-\'node_3\') shows highest compressive stress -28.23 exceeding limit -20. Mass (10.84) is acceptable, so focus is on reducing local stress by better force distribution. Current nodes: fixed pins at node_1 and node_2, load at node_3. Minimal nodes especially on right side may cause high stress at member_6. Node_4 height could be increased for better load distribution. Current area 1 on member_6 is lowest—small area may contribute to high stress. Members with zero stress may have over-dimensioned areas (members 2,3,4 all zero). Introduce diagonal bracing from node_4 to node_2 or add a node to create strong triangular patterns to better carry diagonal load from node_3 while maintaining material economy. Avoid member overlaps or redundant members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Options: Add a new node between node_4 (2,2) and node_2 (6,0) to create two shorter members sharing load. Increase node_4\'s vertical height slightly for leverage and reduce multiple zero stress members. Adjust areas to balance stress: use minimal area where stress is zero to save mass, use larger sections on highly loaded members for compliance.",\n  "proposal": "Add new node_5 at (4.0, 3.0), adding members node_4-node_5 and node_5-node_2 for better force path. Decrease area of members with low stress (members with zero stress → lower area). Increase member_6 area from \'1\' to \'3\' (from 0.195 to 1.759) for reduced stress. Restrict member arrangement to triangulated system: members proposal - \'node_1-node_3\', \'node_3-node_5\', \'node_5-node_2\', \'node_1-node_4\', \'node_4-node_5\', \'node_4-node_3\'. Use areas adapted to stresses: high area for high tensile/compressive stress members, minimal area for zero stress.",\n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 at (4.0,3.0) increases vertical height and lengthens diagonal members, improving force distribution and reducing compressive stress in member_6 (now node_4-node_3). Triangular bracing lets load from node_3 be redirected via node_5 and node_4 to supports, reducing maximum member stresses. Reducing cross-sectional area on near-zero stress members reduces mass without harming constraint adherence. Increment of member_6 area avoids high stress due to small section and short length effect.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Length calculations: node_4(2,2)-node_5(4,3): sqrt(2²+1²)=2.236; node_5(4,3)-node_2(6,0): sqrt(2²+3²)=3.606; node_4(2,2)-node_3(2,0): 2.0 Online members with estimated areas and stresses come below constraints.
