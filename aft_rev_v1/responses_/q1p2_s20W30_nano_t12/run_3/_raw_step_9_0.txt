Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Max allowed stress ±20, max mass 30. Current max stress 78.9 violates limits. Current mass 16.36 acceptable. Nodes and members available per input. Need to reduce stress in member_6 and member_2 especially.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current failure is caused by overstress of member_6 (78.9) and member_2 (-20.16). Critical members carry excessive loads likely due to geometry and connectivity. Member_6 is between node_4 and node_6: shortening or relieving stress there is needed. Member_2 connects node_4 and node_3 also under compression -20.1 just above limit. Current design has 6 nodes, but load and supports fixed at nodes 1, 2, 3. Nodes 4, 5, 6 repositioning or removal possible. Some members have very different cross-section areas (\'3\', \'1\', \'2\'). Areas and connectivity can be altered within constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce member lengths for high stress members. Consider truss geometry so load path redirects force directly between supports with less bending. The load at node_3 is -10 N at 45° downward left. Node 3 is between supports node 1 (pinned) and node 2 (roller), both on ground line y=0. Existing design has nodes raised to form upper chords. Shorter member lengths help reduce stress and mass. Remove excessively stressed members or reorient. Consider adding node to better distribute forces. Areas chosen must keep stress below ±20.",\n  \n  "proposal": "New node_dict keeps load/support nodes fixed: node_1(0.0,0.0), node_2(6.0,0.0), node_3(2.0,0.0). Simplify structure with just a 3-node triangular truss: add node_4 at (3.0,2.0) to form a triangle above base. Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_4. Areas selected reduce mass and stress: mostly area_id=\'1\'(0.195) except possibly node_3-node_4 is \'2\'(0.782) for load distribution. Avoid member spanning node_1 to node_5 or via longer diagonals to reduce high stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_4 at mid-span creates stable triangulated path transferring load to supports. Member lengths are relatively equal and short, avoiding overstress. Area selection ensures stresses stay within limit ±20 with given forces. Member_3 (node_3-node_4) purposely slightly thicker to carry inclined load effectively. Roller and pinned supports reactions will balance via triangular geometry. Member count is minimized to reduce complexity and mass <30. Positions are float precision, and nodes unique according to rules. No unnecessary members or nodes added. This is direct strategy following truss design principles to optimize stress while limiting mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Estimate member lengths: node_1-node_4 ~ sqrt((3-0)^2 + (2-0)^2)=3.61, node_4-node_2 ~ sqrt((6-3)^2+(0-2)^2)=3.60, node_1-node_3=2.0, node_3-node_2=4.0, node_3-node_4 = sqrt((3-2)^2 + (2-0)^2)=2.24.
