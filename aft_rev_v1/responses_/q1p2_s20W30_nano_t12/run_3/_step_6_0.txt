  "preamble": "Optimize a 2D truss with pinned and roller supports and single load at node_3 -10N @-45°.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives: max stress ±20, mass ≤30. Current max stress > 375 (fail), mass 15.7 (OK). Existing large stress mainly compressive in member_3 (node_5-node_2). Supports fixed at nodes_1 and 2; load at node_3 down-left. Need to redesign to reduce stress peaks and ensure load transfer paths balanced.",

  "analysis": "The current design has a critical member_3 under very high compression beyond limits. Member areas and geometry insufficient to balance load causing over-stress. Adding intermediate nodes and re-assigning members to improve force distribution is needed. The design should form multiple truss triangles from node_1 to node_2 passing near node_3 where load is applied, using stiffer tension members towards roller support.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Current layout concentrated forces leading to high stress. To reduce member length and forces in critical members, move intermediate nodes to form a stiffer triangle near load point and add vertical member for shear. Check smaller areas in low-stress members, and assign higher areas on members in compression/tension paths.",

  "proposal": "Use 2 new intermediate nodes near node_3: node_4 at (2.0,2.4) (above load) and node_5 at (4.4,1.8) (between node_3 and node_2), produce members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_4-node_5, and node_4-node_1 forming 3 triangles plus node_3-node_1 (base). Assign cross-sectional areas considering stress distribution: Use area '6' (7.037) for critical compression/tension members node_3-node_5 and node_5-node_2, medium area '3' (1.759) for node_4-node_5 and node_1-node_4, and smaller area '1' (0.195) for node_3-node_1 to keep mass limited, supporting stable equilibrium.",

  "reasoning": "Triangulated frame provides multiple load paths reducing peak member stress. Avoid long slender members under high compression by horizontal component redistribution. Intermediate node_5 placed higher than node_2 for better load direction alignment. Increased areas in tension/compression members ensure stress limits not exceeded. Small area members reduce overall mass. Structure forms stable compression-tension fields balancing load at node_3.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Key constraints: σ_max ≤20, mass ≤30. Member lengths calculated for verification, areas chosen from given sets. Length calculations: node_1-node_4 ~2.4m vertical, node_4-node_3 ~0.4m vertical, node_3-node_5 ~(4.4-2)^2 + (1.8-0)^2)^0.5 ~2.57m, node_5-node_2 ~ distance (6-4.4,0-1.8) ~ 2.12m.
