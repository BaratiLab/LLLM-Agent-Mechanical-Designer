Supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller). Current structure too stressed (65.59 > 20), mass under 30 but not optimal.",\n    \n    "analysis": "High compressive stress in member_6 (node_3-node_1) at -65.59 indicates it\'s undersized or poorly oriented. Member areas at 1 or 3 seem insufficient. Current topology big enough but force redirection needed. Using inclining diagonals and reducing member_6 stress could help. Distance and geometry adjustment will redistribute forces, reducing peak stress and mass simultaneously. A triangulated structure avoiding direct long compressive members under heavy bending is desirable.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Change: reposition node_5 closer to the upper right to shorten compression members, drop member 3 area from 4 to 2 or 3. Check if stressing diagonal from load to roller can reduce loading on node_3 to pinned joint half-length member. Increase areas on members in tension, reduce unnecessary compression members\' area.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Keep supports and loading nodes fixed {node_1, node_2, node_3}. Reposition node_4 slightly left and node_5 shifted higher but shorter link to node_2. Remove member between node_3 and node_1 (member_6) to reduce long compressive stress and add new member from node_1 to node_5 to triangulate better (member_6). Adjust cross sectional areas to balance stresses below ±20. Use area ids mostly in range [2-4].",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Removing member_6 between node_3 and node_1 will reduce compressive demand on that long span. Adding member_6 from node_1 to node_5 creates better force path and redundancy. Moving node_4 downward reduces leverage effect causing high compressive stress. Enlarging main tension diagonals reduces member stress. Selecting moderate areas prevents overdesign while meeting mass constraint. Introducing triangulation wards off buckling and distributes compression smarter. This preserves original load/support and applies best design practices to meet all constraints.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Key approach: triangulate with shorter, stiffer diagonals; respect nodal fixed points; ensure all areas ≥ 0; use areas 2,3,4 mainly to reduce mass.
