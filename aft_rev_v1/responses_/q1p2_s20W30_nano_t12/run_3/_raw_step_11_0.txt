Current max stress >>20 and some compressive stresses >> limits, also specific members under very high stress.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current design\'s max tensile and compressive stresses exceed ±20 margin notably, particularly member_4 (node_4-node_2) and members involving node_5 being overstressed. Total mass is far from max limit thus area sizes can be reduced judiciously. Structural layout with node_5 near mid-span not easing load path effectively; path from load node_3 needs stronger direct load path towards supports with optimized geometry to reduce member stress. Current geometry compromises stress distribution leading to high max stress.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_5 or reposition to simplify force path; add well-placed node between node_3 & node_2 to better direct forces; provide triangulated stable truss between supports and load input node. Smaller member areas for non-critical members, larger for critical compression and tension. Balanced geometry enhanced by moving node_4 position optimizing triangle shapes for better force control.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Fix nodes for support and load; introduce one additional node between node_3 and node_2 shifted upwards; change node_4 location to provide optimized triangular frame; remove node_5 to simplify force flow. Use selected member areas fitting compressive/tensile stresses with given max areas to optimize total mass and meet constraints. Member layout: members between node_1-node_3, node_3-new_node, new_node-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-new_node, node_4-node_2, node_4-node_3 for rigid triangulation and load path.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangulated truss structures better distribute applied loads. The previously asymmetrically placed mid-nodes cause stress concentrations and poorer force flow. By introducing a node vertically above the line between node_3 and node_2, we provide better load transfer. Reduced member area on light compression members and increased on members close to load. Resizing member areas adhering strictly to ±20 stress and minimizing mass keeps the design inside constraints. Stresses estimated conservatively based on member length, load, and static indeterminacy reduction by triangle forms.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths as Euclidean distances, mass as sum(length * area).
