Load at node_3 downward left. Supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller). Existing design has max stress 53.7, over limit. Total mass 14.7 well below limit.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current layout: bottom chord nodes 1,3,2; upper nodes 4 and 6 ~1.8 height. Members mostly low area (1 or 2). Highest stress on member_5 (node_4-node_6) at 53.7 (too high). All other members under ±20 stress except maximum. Loading causes tension/compression changing across structure. Lack of intermediate top nodes leads to high stress peaks. Also member_7 from node_4 to node_2 adds complexity and may concentrate stress on upper right segment.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, improve stiffness by increasing triangular elements and better load path. Consider simplifying connections at right side to reduce redundant compressive member (member_7). Also move upper nodes strategically: node_4 low, node_6 slightly lower or reposition. Introduce a node between node_3 and node_6 to split longer member into shorter, more manageable length. This encourages lower force per member. Use minimal members and minimal large area profiles.",\n\n  "proposal": "Keep same support and load nodes. Maintain node_1, node_2, and node_3 positions. Add two new nodes above structure: node_4 at x=2.5, y=1.4; node_5 at x=4.0, y=1.0 (lower and wider spread compared to old node_6 at 4.0, 1.8). Members: bottom chord node_1-node_3-node_2; top chord node_1-node_4-node_5-node_2; verticals and diagonals connecting to distribute loads: members node_3-node_4, node_3-node_5, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_4; total avoid node_7 member wiring to node_4-node_2 to reduce high stress risks. Assign optimized areas with larger for longer members (e.g. area=3 or 4), small for shorter diagonals (area=1 or 2).",\n\n  "reasoning": "Adding nodes at intermediate heights with spacing similar to horizontal spacing reduces unsupported member length and thus stress. Triangular pattern in upper chords provides efficient load transfer. Avoid direct diagonal to far node_2 from node_4 minimizes eccentric load on member. Lower height of nodes reduces bending effect. Mid-level chords and diagonals reduce peak tensile/compressive stresses and improve stiffness. Keeping mass below 30 achievable by limiting areas ++ intermediate diagonals small area. This approach balances mass and stress distribution for constraints compliance.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2m horiz; node_3-node_4 ~ sqrt((2.5-2)^2 + (1.4-0)^2)=~1.43m; node_3-node_5 ~ sqrt((4-2)^2 + (1-0)^2)=~2.24; node_4-node_5 (4-2.5=1.5,1-1.4= -0.4) length ~1.55m; node_5-node_2 (6-4=2,0-1=1) length ~2.24; node_4-node_2 (6-2.5=3.5,0-1.4= -1.4) length ~3.74; node_1-node_4 (2.5-0=2.5,1.4-0=1.4) length ~2.88; Area codes between 1 (0.195) and 4(3.128) balance mass. Use smaller profiles on shorter members to minimize mass. Stresses assumed proportional to member length and load distribution. Expect max stress approx <20 since control structure geometry and member sizes.",\n \n  "calculation": "Mass sum = Σ length × area × density (density normalized). Estimating total mass ~ (2*2 + 1.43*1 + 2.24*2 + 1.55*1 + 2.24*2 + 3.74*1 + 2.88*2) * area value sum simplified estimate. Prior iteration mass was 14.6 for longer members and less spread.

Minimal 7 elements configuration increases stability.", \n  "scratch_pad_final": "Generated new node locations and members with careful sizing; load introduced direction handled by triangular layouts; mass constraint met with chosen areas; expect stress peaks <20 tension or compression.
