These members are small area (area \'1\') so stress is concentrated. Geometry with node_4 and node_5 close and low height combined with small areas leads to stress spikes. High stress in tension and compression beyond Â±20 allowed.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Members with max stress: member_4 (163.17), member_6 (-130.18). Need larger cross-sections or revised geometry. Member_4 length ~0.7m; at area 1, could not handle load. So add height and optimize connectivity to reduce member forces, increase area cautiously to keep mass low.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Redesign structure by adding an intermediate node higher than node_4 and node_5 to distribute forces, increase effective height of truss. Remove member_4 and member_6 from direct load path. Use a triangular truss shape with added node at about (3.0, 2.5). Connection scheme: node_1 to node_3 below, node_3 to node_4 and new node_7, node_7 to node_5 and node_2, add cross diagonals node_4-node_5 and node_4-node_7.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular trusses provide good force transfer with fewer bending moments. Increasing vertical height reduces compressive force intensity. Adding node_7 at higher elevation changes force flow from steep compression to more distributed tension/compression. Use larger area (three to five) on longest and highest load path members, smaller areas on tension ties. Makes stress manageable while keeping mass below 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Members chosen with calibrated sectional areas: highest stressed use area 3 or 4, connecting load node_3 use moderate size 2.
