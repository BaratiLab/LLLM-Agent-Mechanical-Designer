  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss with 3 fixed and loaded nodes; reduce max stress ±20 and mass <=30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Loads: node_3: 10N @ -45°. Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Existing nodes stable for supports/loads. Stress/current mass too high, need lower stress and manage mass.",
  "analysis": "Current max stress 72.52 >20 limit, mainly on member_1 (-72.52), likely compression. Mass 4.32 below 30 but stress violation dominates. Members have small cross-sectional areas (0.195~0.782), need increased stiffness or better load paths. Minimal nodes: 3 load/support nodes + 1 inner node appears insufficient. Prior solutions used added nodes mostly but complex or overweight. Proposal: maintain 4 nodes, reposition intermediate node more optimally for force transfer. Increase area in critical compressive members, add key triangulation, maintain low mass by selecting critical member areas wisely.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus to reduce compressive stress at member_1 by adding a supplementary node (node_5) close to midpoint between node_3 and node_4 with small upward shift; add members forming 2 triangles that share loading, balanced areas 0.782 and 1.759 selectively. Keep a simple truss avoiding overloaded long members. Place node_5 at (3.2,1.2) for more vertical support and optimize connectivity.",
  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (3.2,1.2); member connection: connect node_3 to node_5, node_5 to node_4, node_5 to node_2, alongside original members with appropriate areas for optimized force distribution: 'member_1' (node_1-node_3) area 2 (0.782), 'member_2' (node_3-node_5) area 1 (0.195), 'member_3' (node_5-node_4) area 2 (0.782), 'member_4' (node_4-node_2) area 1 (0.195), 'member_5' (node_3-node_4) area 2 (0.782), 'member_6' (node_5-node_2) area 1 (0.195), 'member_7' (node_1-node_4) area 2 (0.782). This triangulated layout balances stresses and limits member length.",
  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 by lifting it to y=1.2 provides vertical support improving stress distribution under the -45° load on node_3. Triangular bracing reduces maximum member stress by redistributing loads and limits compression peaks on (node_1-node_3). Areas balance between moderate stiffness and minimal mass impact. Area 1 (0.195) used for shorter members to save mass; 2 (0.782) for longer/high-stress members per constraints to keep below max stress. Prior indication that larger areas improved stress. Member differential area choice saves mass below limit.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumed member lengths: node_1-node_3: 2.0 m; node_3-node_5: sqrt((3.2-2)^2 + (1.2-0)^2)=~1.85 m; node_5-node_4: sqrt((3-3.2)^2+(2-1.2)^2)=~0.85 m; node_4-node_2: 3.0 m; node_3-node_4: sqrt((3-2)^2+(2-0)^2)=~2.24 m; node_5-node_2: sqrt((6-3.2)^2+(0-1.2)^2)=~3.04 m; node_1-node_4: sqrt((3-0)^2+(2-0)^2)=~3.605 m.",
  "calculation": "Mass estimate=sum length × area_unit: (2.0*0.782)+(1.85*0.195)+(0.85*0.782)+(3*0.195)+(2.24*0.782)+(3.04*0.195)+(3.605*0.782). Evaluate numerically: 1.564 +0.361 +0.665 +0.585 +1.752 +0.593 +2.821=~8.341 total mass << 30 constraint. Area 1 chosen for shorter members reduces mass. Expected stress reduced using these graduated areas and braced triangles. Expected max stress <20 MPa by distributing force path and shortening compression members (priors showed max stress reduced by reducing length and increasing area in compression members). Mass is well below max 30.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_5 addition and updated connectivity forms robust triangular truss with staged cross-sectional areas controlling stresses. Mass budget respected. Nodal positions fixed for supports/loads preserve stability. No duplicate members or nodes. Solution spans load re-distribution through triangulation avoiding critical stress peaks.
