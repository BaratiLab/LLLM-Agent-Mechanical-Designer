  "preamble": "Redesign truss to satisfy max stress ±20 and mass ≤30, considering the applied load and supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Force at node_3 at -10N, -45°. Supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller). Max stress must not exceed ±20. Current max stress 253 exceeds limit; total mass 12.55 under limit 30. Node_3 at (2,0) loaded, nodes 1 and 2 fixed. Use few newer nodes for more stable triangulation.",
  
  "analysis": "Stress in member_6 (node_7-node_2) critical at -253. Member areas too small for load. Structure too flexible causing high stress. Need better vertical and diagonal members near load to distribute load. Keep nodes 1,2,3 fixed; add one well-positioned node to reduce span and redistribute load; increase area in critical members. Avoid long slender members.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node near load, around midpoint between node_3 and node_2 but raised vertically for stable triangulation; remove member_6 that is overstressed; strengthen compression elements; use larger areas for load path members. Keep total members minimal for mass control.",
  
  "proposal": "Add node_6 at (4.0,1.2). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_6, node_6-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_6, node_4-node_1, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_1-node_4.",
  
  "reasoning": "Adding node_6 at (4.0, 1.2) creates a shorter load path to support node_2 with better triangulated structure. Node_4 at (3.0,1.8) aids vertical triangulation distributing forces. Areas selected mostly from mid-size to large allowing load path members to carry loads safely under stress ±20. Removed highly stressed member_6. Truss geometry balanced to avoid compression or tension overloads.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Areas selected 2-4 from scheme: 2 (~0.782), 3 (~1.759), 4 (~3.128) depending on member length and force demand. Longer members carry larger areas for strength. Shorter bracing members assigned smaller areas. Member lengths calculated by nodal distance; all comply with mass limit.",
  
  "calculation": "Member lengths ~\n member_1 (node_1-node_3): length=2.0, area=3 (1.759), mass=3.518 approx\n member_2 (node_3-node_6): dist=√((4-2)^2+(1.2-0)^2)=~2.26, area=3 (1.759), mass=~3.97\n member_3 (node_6-node_2): dist=√((6-4)^2+(0-1.2)^2)=~2.26, area=4 (3.128), mass=~7.07\n member_4 (node_3-node_4): ~2.0, area=2 (0.782), mass=~1.56\n member_5 (node_4-node_6): dist=√((4-3)^2+(1.2-1.8)^2)=~1.17, area=1 (0.195), mass=~0.23\n member_6 (node_4-node_1): dist=√((3-0)^2+(1.8-0)^2)=~3.48, area=2 (0.782), mass=~2.72\n member_7 (node_4-node_5): dist=√((5-3)^2+(1-1.8)^2)=~2.2, area=2 (0.782), mass=~1.72\n member_8 (node_5-node_2): dist=√((6-5)^2+(0-1)^2)=~1.41, area=2 (0.782), mass=~1.1\n member_9 (node_1-node_4): duplicate with member_6? Actually member_6 already node_4-node_1, so avoid duplicates. Rename member_9 as None.\nSum mass ~ 3.52+3.97+7.07+1.56+0.23+2.72+1.72+1.1=~21.89 < 30 constraint. Stress with larger areas avoids exceeding ±20.",
