Supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller). Max stress must not exceed ±20. Current max stress 253 exceeds limit; total mass 12.55 under limit 30. Node_3 at (2,0) loaded, nodes 1 and 2 fixed. Use few newer nodes for more stable triangulation.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Stress in member_6 (node_7-node_2) critical at -253. Member areas too small for load.

Avoid long slender members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node near load, around midpoint between node_3 and node_2 but raised vertically for stable triangulation; remove member_6 that is overstressed; strengthen compression elements; use larger areas for load path members.
