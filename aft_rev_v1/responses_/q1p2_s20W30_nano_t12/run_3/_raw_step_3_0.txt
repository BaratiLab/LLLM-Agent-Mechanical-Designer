Overstressed in member_5,_2 especially. Members near load under tensile/compressive stress beyond limits. Current node layout has node_3 between supports with load; only one upper node (node_4). Constraints unmet; need redesign to reduce stress concentration and leverage geometry for force distribution.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce long member stress; redistribute forces by adding nodes. Possibly add an upper node between node_3 and node_2 vertically to create triangular bracing, making a stiffer frame. Larger areas only where needed to control stresses. Avoid mass increase over budget.",\n\n  "proposal": "Keep supports and load node fixed. Add a new node (node_5) at (4.0, 2.5) above node_2 side. Redefine members forming two overlapping triangles: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_4-node_3. Areas assigned to control stress: larger area for longest diagonals to reduce stress, smaller for compressive members compressive forces to save mass.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Triangular geometry provides stability and force path distribution reducing load on diagonal member_5 of previous layout that exceeded stress limits. New upper node allows better force resolution. Select cross-sectional areas using stress magnitude approximations and member length; tensile stress members get larger area. Longer members require more area to control stress.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node positions: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2,2) same, new node_5(4,2.5).

Assign areas: m5 largest compressive, assign \'3\'; m1, m2, m3 tension members assign \'2\'; shorter m4, m6 assign \'1\'. Estimated mass: sum(length*area) = (2*0.782)+(3.2016*0.782)+(3.2016*0.782)+(2*0.195)+(2.0616*1.759)+(2*0.195)=1.564+2.503+2.503+0.39+3.628+0.39=10.978 < 30.
