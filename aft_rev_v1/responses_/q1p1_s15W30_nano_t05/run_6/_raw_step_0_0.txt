Objective: closed truss, max stress ±15, max mass 30. Areas discrete from 0 to 10. Must keep node positions fixed for supports and load.",\n\n  "analysis": "The truss is initially a line along x-axis with nodes at (0,0), (2,0), (6,0). To form a closed truss, add nodes above or below the line connecting existing nodes to form triangles. Triangles ensure stability and distribute loads. The load at node_3 is downward-left, so adding a node above node_3 to form a triangle with node_1 and node_2 would help resist this load. To minimize stress, members should be shorter and areas chosen to balance stress and mass. Use simple static equilibrium and truss assumptions (axial forces only).",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 above node_3 at (2.0, 3.0) to form two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_3, node_2, node_4).

Choose areas to keep stress ≤15 and mass ≤30.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Closed truss requires at least one triangle. Adding node_4 at (2,3) creates two triangles sharing node_3. Members from node_1 and node_2 to node_4 will carry vertical and horizontal components of load. Use simple truss analysis: sum forces at node_3 and node_4. Assume axial forces only. Calculate member lengths, then estimate forces using equilibrium. Select area sizes to keep stress within ±15. Mass = sum(length × area). Use smaller areas for longer members if stress is low, larger areas where stress is high.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_2 = 4.0, node_1-node_4 = sqrt(2²+3²)=3.6056, node_3-node_4=3.0, node_2-node_4= sqrt((6-2)²+3²)=5.0. Load at node_3 is 10N at -45°. Resolve load into components Fx = -7.07N, Fy = -7.07N. Equilibrium at node_3: sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0. Calculate member forces, then stress = force/area. Choose areas from given set to keep stress ≤15 and minimize mass.",\n\n  "calculation": "At node_3, members connected: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_4. Assume tension positive. Let forces in members be F13, F32, F34. Equilibrium: Fx: F13 + F32 + F34x + Fx_load=0; Fy: F13y + F32y + F34y + Fy_load=0. Approximate directions: node_1-node_3 horizontal left to right, node_3-node_2 horizontal right, node_3-node_4 vertical up. So F13 and F32 along x-axis, F34 vertical. Fx: F13 + F32 -7.07=0; Fy: F34 -7.07=0 → F34=7.07N (tension). Fx: F13 + F32=7.07N. To balance, let F13=2N tension, F32=5.07N tension. Check stresses: member areas chosen to keep stress ≤15. Stress = force/area. For F34=7.07N, area≥7.07/15=0.471. Choose area 1 (0.195) too small, area 2 (0.782) sufficient. For F32=5.07N, area≥5.07/15=0.338, choose area 1 (0.195) too small, area 2 (0.782) sufficient. For F13=2N, area≥2/15=0.133, area 1 (0.195) sufficient. Mass = sum(length × area): 2×0.195 + 4×0.782 + 3×0.782 + 3.6056×0.195 + 5×0.195 = 0.39 + 3.128 + 2.346 + 0.703 + 0.975 = 7.542 < 30.
