Constraints: max stress Â±15, max mass 30. Current max stress 40.29 exceeds limit, mass 31.38 slightly over limit. Need to reduce stress and mass by modifying topology and member areas.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has high stress in member_6 (node_1-node_4) at 40.29 and total mass slightly above 30. Members with area 3 and 2 dominate mass. Members around node_4 carry significant load. Adding node_6 did not reduce stress adequately. Some members are oversized or underutilized. The load at node_3 is diagonal, so members should provide good triangulation to distribute forces efficiently.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress and mass: 1) Add intermediate nodes to better distribute load paths. 2) Use smaller areas on less stressed members, larger areas only where needed. 3) Remove redundant members that add mass without reducing stress. 4) Keep supports and load nodes fixed. 5) Triangulate structure around load node_3 and node_4 for stability.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add one new node (node_7) near midpoint between node_3 and node_4 to improve load path. Remove member_6 (node_1-node_4) which had high stress and replace with members connecting node_1-node_7 and node_7-node_4 with optimized areas. Adjust areas on members to reduce mass and keep stress within limits. Keep members connecting node_3, node_5, node_4, node_2, and node_1 as needed. Remove member_9 (node_6-node_5) as it is near zero stress and adds mass. Use areas mostly in range 1-3 to reduce mass but sufficient to handle loads.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_6 had highest stress and was a direct diagonal from support to upper node, causing high load concentration. Splitting this load path via a new node reduces member length and stress. Removing low-stress members reduces mass. Using smaller areas on low-stress members reduces mass. The new node_7 at (3.0, 2.0) balances load transfer between node_1, node_4, and node_3. Triangulation via node_7 improves stiffness and load distribution. This approach should reduce max stress below 15 and total mass below 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Positions: node_7 = (3.0, 2.0).
