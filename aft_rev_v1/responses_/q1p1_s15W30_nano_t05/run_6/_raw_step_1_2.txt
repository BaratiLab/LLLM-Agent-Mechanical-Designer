Constraints: max stress ±15, max mass 30. Current max stress 52.4 exceeds limit, mass 7.54 is okay. Need to reduce stress by redesign or member sizing.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has a concentrated load at node_3 with members connecting to nodes 1, 2, and 4. High compressive stress (-52.4) in member_1 (node_1-node_3) is main issue. Member areas: member_1 area=1 (0.195), member_2 and member_3 area=2 (0.782), others area=1. Increasing area of member_1 alone may not be enough; topology needs improvement. Node_4 at (2,3) is above node_3; members to node_4 carry moderate stress. Structure lacks triangulation for effective load distribution. Adding node(s) to improve load path and triangulation is needed. Member lengths and areas must be balanced to reduce stress below 15 and keep mass under 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding a node between node_3 and node_2 or node_4 to reduce member length and stress. Use larger area members in high stress paths. Avoid changing supports or load nodes. Use precise coordinates for new nodes. Possibly add diagonal members for better triangulation. Keep total mass under 30 with areas from given set.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add one new node (node_5) above node_3 and between node_2 and node_4 to improve triangulation and reduce member lengths. Connect node_5 to node_3, node_2, and node_4. Adjust member areas to reduce stress: use area_id 3 (1.759) or 4 (3.128) on critical members. Keep existing nodes and supports fixed. Remove member_2 (node_3-node_2) to reduce long member stress and replace it with two shorter members via node_5.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 at (4.0, 2.0) creates smaller triangles, reducing member length and stress. Removing direct member_3-node_2 reduces high stress member_2. New members (node_3-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_5-node_4) distribute load better. Increase cross-sectional areas on members under high stress to reduce stress magnitude. Use areas: member_1 (node_1-node_3) area 4 (3.128), member_3 (node_3-node_4) area 3 (1.759), new members area 2 (0.782) or 3 (1.759).

Mass = sum(length × area). With chosen areas total mass < 15, well below 30. Stress expected to be under 15 due to shorter members and increased areas.
