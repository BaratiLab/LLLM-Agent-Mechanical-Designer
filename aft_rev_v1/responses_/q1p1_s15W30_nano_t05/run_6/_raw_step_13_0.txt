Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Constraints: max stress ±15, max mass 30. Current design max stress 108.1 (too high), mass 23.6 (acceptable). Need to reduce stress by better force distribution and possibly larger areas on critical members.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current max stress is on member_10 (-108) and member_11 (-96.7), both connecting node_8 to node_4 and node_5 with area 1 (0.195). These members are highly overstressed in compression. Member_8 (node_1-node_7) has tensile stress 54, also too high. The structure has a complex node arrangement with node_7 and node_8 close to each other at top center. The load is on node_3 near middle bottom. The truss is asymmetric and has several small members with small area, causing stress concentration. Mass is under limit, so increasing some areas is possible. The support conditions are fixed and nodes for load/support fixed. Node_8 placement at (3,2.5) seems to cause high compression in members connected to it. Need to redistribute forces by repositioning node_8 and/or removing it to simplify load path. Also, member_7 (node_7-node_4) area is 1 (0.195), very small for a top chord member under compression/tension. Member_5 (node_5-node_2) area 1 is small, but stress is -16.29, slightly above limit. Member_1 (node_1-node_3) and member_2 (node_3-node_5) have area 3 (1.759), stress is moderate. The structure can be simplified by removing node_8 and its members, increasing areas on critical members, and possibly adding a diagonal member from node_3 to node_4 to better distribute load. This can reduce stress peaks and keep mass under 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_8 and members 9,10,11. Increase area of members 7 and 8 to 3. Add diagonal member from node_3 to node_4 with area 3. Keep existing nodes except load/support nodes. Check stress and mass estimates. Member lengths approx: node_3-node_4 ~3.6, node_7-node_4 ~1.8, node_1-node_7 ~3.2. Areas 3 means 1.759. Mass approx = sum(length*area_density). Total mass expected ~ 23-25.

Increasing areas on top chord and diagonal members reduces stress. Adding diagonal member node_3-node_4 provides direct load path from load node_3 to support node_4 and node_2, reducing bending and stress concentration. Keeping node_5 for vertical support and node_7 for triangulation maintains stability. Areas selected from allowed set with preference for area 3 (1.759) for main load carrying members to keep mass reasonable. Member_5 area 1 (0.195) to reduce mass as stress there is moderate.
