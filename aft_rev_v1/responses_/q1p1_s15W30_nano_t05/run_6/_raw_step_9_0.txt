Nodes at load/support fixed. Need to reduce stress further if possible.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has low max stress and mass well below limit. Stress is well distributed and low in magnitude. Members with stress near zero or low magnitude suggest potential for area reduction or node repositioning. Node_9 added for internal bracing, improving stress distribution. Load at node_3 fixed; support nodes fixed. Moving intermediate nodes only.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on repositioning node_9 and node_7 to better align force paths and possibly reduce member areas. Check if any member areas can be reduced without increasing stress beyond limits. Avoid increasing mass beyond 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Node_9 currently at (2.5,1.75) connects node_1, node_3, node_7. Moving node_9 slightly lower or closer to node_3 may improve force flow and reduce stress in members 9,10,11. Node_7 at (3,2) connects node_3, node_4, node_9; slight repositioning might optimize angles and reduce stress. Areas are mostly small (1 or 2), can consider reducing member_1 area from 3 to 2 or 1 if stress allows. Members with very low stress (e.g., member_3, member_4) area could be reduced to lower mass further. However, member_1 has stress -4.95, so area reduction must be cautious.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member areas: member_1:3, member_2:2, member_3:2, member_4:2, member_5:1, member_6:3, member_7:2, member_9:2, member_10:2, member_11:2. Total mass 20.11. Max stress 4.95. Small margin to further reduce stress and mass.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Move node_9 down from y=1.75 to y=1.5 to improve force angle with node_1 and node_3; move node_7 slightly up from y=2.0 to y=2.2 to better align with node_4 and node_3. Reduce area of member_1 from 3 to 2 to reduce mass, stress expected to increase slightly but still within limits. Reduce area of member_3 from 2 to 1 to reduce mass, stress is very low (-0.21).
