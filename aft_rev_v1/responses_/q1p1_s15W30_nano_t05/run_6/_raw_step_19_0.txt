Current max stress 19.33 > 15, mass 24.35 < 30. Need to reduce max stress by better force path and cross-section distribution.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high stress in member_10 (node_1-node_5) at 19.33, and compressive stress in member_1 and member_5 exceed ±15. Members near load transfer are overstressed. Mass is acceptable but cross-section allocation and geometry can be improved. Existing nodes at load/support fixed; internal nodes can be repositioned or added for better load distribution. Member areas mostly 1,2,3; some possibly oversized or undersized. Structure has multiple redundant members from node_1 to nodes 4 and 5 causing stress concentration.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on creating a stiffer load path from node_3 through nodes 5,6,8 to supports. Reduce oversized members causing stress concentration. Add a node near load to distribute forces. Use minimal cross-section for less stressed members, increase for critical ones but keep below area \'3\' (1.759) to control mass. Remove redundant members from node_1 to node_4 and node_5 to reduce mass and stress.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Revise structure: Keep nodes_1,2,3 fixed. Add node_7 at (3.0,1.8) to better distribute load. Connect node_3 to node_7, node_7 to node_4 and node_2, node_7 to node_5. Remove direct member node_1 to node_4 and node_1 to node_5 to reduce stress concentration. Use areas: 2 for main load path members, 1 for secondary. Member connections: member_1(node_1-node_3,2), member_2(node_3-node_5,2), member_3(node_5-node_4,2), member_4(node_4-node_2,2), member_5(node_5-node_2,1), member_6(node_3-node_7,2), member_7(node_7-node_4,1), member_8(node_7-node_2,1), member_9(node_7-node_5,1), member_10(node_1-node_6,1), member_11(node_6-node_4,1), member_12(node_6-node_2,1).

Removing direct members from node_1 to node_4 and node_5 reduces stress concentration at node_1. Using moderate areas (1.759 or 0.195) balances mass and strength.
