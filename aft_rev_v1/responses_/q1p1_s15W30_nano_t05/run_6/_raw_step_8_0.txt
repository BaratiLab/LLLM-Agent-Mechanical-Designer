Max stress ±15, max mass 30. Current max stress 44 too high, mass 12.4 under limit. Need to reduce stress, keep mass low.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has high stress in member_8 and member_1 (44 and 14), both connected to node_1 and node_7 or node_3. Member areas are small (1 and 2). Load at node_3 causes high tension/compression near supports. Adding intermediate nodes or better triangulation can reduce stress. Current mass is low, so some increase allowed to reduce stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Avoid large area on long members to reduce mass. Use small to moderate areas on shorter members. Add a node between node_3 and node_7 or node_5 to redistribute forces. Avoid member_8 (node_1-node_7) with area 1 causing high stress, replace with stiffer triangulation. Use area 3 or 4 for critical members near supports.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node near midpoint between node_3 and node_7 to create additional triangulation. Remove member_8 (node_1-node_7). Increase area of members from node_1 to node_3 and node_3 to node_7 to area 3 or 4. Add members from new node to node_7 and node_5 with moderate area. Keep existing supports and load nodes fixed.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangulation improves load path and reduces peak stress. Increasing area on members near supports reduces stress. Removing direct long member from node_1 to node_7 reduces stress concentration. Adding intermediate node redistributes forces and reduces tension in critical members.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Select node_9 at (2.5, 1.75) between node_3(2,0) and node_7(3,2). Replace member_8 with members node_1-node_9, node_9-node_7, node_9-node_3. Area assignments: node_1-node_3 (3), node_3-node_7 (3), node_1-node_9 (2), node_9-node_7 (2), node_9-node_3 (2). Other members keep area 2 or 1 as appropriate.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_7 ≈ 2.236, node_1-node_9 ≈ 2.958, node_9-node_7 ≈ 0.559, node_9-node_3 ≈ 1.118. Mass = Σ length * area_factor. Area factors: \'1\':0.195, \'2\':0.782, \'3\':1.759, \'4\':3.128. Mass approx: (2*1.759)+(2.236*1.759)+(2.958*0.782)+(0.559*0.782)+(1.118*0.782) + other members.
