  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to meet max stress ±15 and mass ≤30 under given load and supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 (-10N, -45°), supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Current max stress 36.3 > 15, mass 23.7 < 30. Need to reduce stress, especially member_8 (node_1-node_7) with 36.3 stress.",
  
  "analysis": "High stress in member_8 (node_1-node_7) indicates load path concentration. Member_8 area is small (area_id=1=0.195), increasing area may reduce stress but increases mass. Current node_7 at (3.0,1.5) may cause high bending. Member_9 (node_3-node_4) has zero stress, possibly redundant. Member_4 and member_7 have small areas. The structure can be simplified by removing node_7 and node_9, adding a new node closer to load path to distribute forces better, and selecting appropriate member areas to keep mass under 30.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_7 to reduce complexity and high stress member_8. Add node_6 at (3.0, 2.0) to create a more direct load path from node_3 to node_4 and node_2. Use members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_5-node_2, node_3-node_6, node_6-node_4, node_6-node_2. Assign moderate areas to reduce stress and keep mass low.",
  
  "proposal": "New structure with nodes: node_1(0.0,0.0), node_2(6.0,0.0), node_3(2.0,0.0), node_4(4.0,3.0), node_5(2.0,2.5), node_6(3.0,2.0). Members: node_1-node_3(area 2), node_3-node_5(area 3), node_5-node_4(area 3), node_4-node_2(area 2), node_5-node_2(area 1), node_3-node_6(area 3), node_6-node_4(area 2), node_6-node_2(area 1). Remove node_7 and its members.",
  
  "reasoning": "Removing node_7 reduces high stress member_8. Adding node_6 at (3,2) creates a triangular load path distributing forces efficiently. Area selection balances stress and mass: larger areas (3=1.759) on main load paths (node_3-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_3-node_6) to reduce stress; smaller areas (1=0.195) on less stressed members (node_5-node_2, node_6-node_2). This aims to keep max stress ≤15 and total mass ≤30.",
