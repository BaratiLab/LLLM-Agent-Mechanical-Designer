Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Current max stress 52.4 >15, mass 37.5 >30. Need lighter, stronger design.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has excessive stress in members 1, 3, 6, 7 and mass exceeds limit. Members with area 4 and 1 mostly cause high mass. Structure has node_6 at (3,3.5) increasing member lengths and mass. Load at node_3 (2,0) needs better support transfer. Existing nodes at load/support fixed; can add/move others. Triangulation needed for stability and stress distribution. Current members not optimally sized or placed.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_6 to reduce complexity and length. Add node above node_3 for vertical support. Use smaller area members where possible. Use triangular bracing between node_1, node_3, node_4, node_2 with new node_5 above node_3. Aim for members with area ≤3.128 to reduce mass. Check member lengths and forces for stress compliance.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Nodes: node_1(0.0,0.0), node_2(6.0,0.0), node_3(2.0,0.0), node_4(4.0,3.0), node_5(2.0,2.5). Members: member_1(node_1-node_3, area 3), member_2(node_3-node_5, area 3), member_3(node_5-node_4, area 3), member_4(node_4-node_2, area 3), member_5(node_5-node_2, area 2), member_6(node_1-node_4, area 1), member_7(node_3-node_4, area 1). This creates a stable triangulated frame with reduced member lengths and moderate areas.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 above node_3 provides vertical load path, reducing stress in horizontal members. Using moderate areas (3 =1.759, 2=0.782, 1=0.195) balances mass and strength. Triangulation ensures stability and distributes load effectively. Removing node_6 reduces member lengths and mass. Member_5 from node_5 to node_2 helps transfer load diagonally reducing stress on node_4 to node_2. Member_6 and 7 with smallest area provide lateral stability without large mass penalty.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_1-node_3: 2.0, node_3-node_5: 2.5, node_5-node_4: ~2.06, node_4-node_2: 3.0, node_5-node_2: ~4.12, node_1-node_4: 5.0, node_3-node_4: ~3.61. Mass = sum(length*area) ≈ 2*1.759 + 2.5*1.759 + 2.06*1.759 + 3*1.759 + 4.12*0.782 + 5*0.195 + 3.61*0.195 ≈ 3.52 + 4.40 + 3.62 + 5.28 + 3.22 + 0.98 + 0.70 = 21.72 < 30.
