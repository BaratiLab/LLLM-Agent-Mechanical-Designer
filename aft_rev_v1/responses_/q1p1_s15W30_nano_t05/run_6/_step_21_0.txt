  "preamble": "Current 7-member truss with 5 nodes meets constraints with low max stress and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective is to minimize stress under ±15 limit and mass ≤30. Current max stress ~7.72 and mass ~25.76 within limits.",
  "analysis": "Current structure has balanced stress distribution, no member exceeds ±15 stress limit. Mass is well under 30. Load and supports fixed at node_3, node_1, and node_2 respectively. Node_5 and node_6 positions allow efficient load transfer. Members use area IDs 2 and 3, providing moderate cross-section. No redundant members or nodes.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further node position tweaking risks stress increase or mass increase. Adding members or changing area IDs may increase mass or stress. Current stress is low, indicating limited room for improvement.",
  "reasoning": "Given constraints and current results, the structure is efficient. Max stress is about half the allowable limit, and mass is below max. Slight node moves may disrupt load paths and increase stress. The closed truss with 7 members is minimal for stability and load transfer. Areas selected balance mass and stress well.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress max 7.72 < 15; total mass 25.76 < 30. Members with highest stress have area 2, moderate cross-section. Nodes at (2.0,2.5) and (4.0,2.5) provide good geometry. Load at node_3 downward left at 45 degrees is well supported with current topology.",
  "calculation": "No recalculation needed as FEM results show all constraints met with margin. Further optimization unlikely to reduce max stress significantly without increasing mass or complexity.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Confirm no load/support node moved, no duplicate members/nodes, areas from allowed set. Structure closed and stable. Stop optimization.",
