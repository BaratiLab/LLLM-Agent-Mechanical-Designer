Current max stress 21.53 > 15, mass 26.48 < 30. Need to reduce max stress, mainly in member_6 (node_1-node_7).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has a critical stress in member_6 connecting node_1 to node_7, causing failure. Member_6 has area_id \'1\' (0.195), which is small. Increasing area or changing geometry may help. Node_7 placement at (3,2) creates a long diagonal member_6 under high stress. Members around node_7 are low area, causing stress concentration. The truss shape is somewhat irregular. Load at node_3 is downward-left, causing tension/compression in members near node_3 and node_7.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Options: 1) Increase area of member_6, but mass will increase. 2) Add or reposition node(s) to better distribute forces. 3) Adjust member connectivity to form stable triangles and reduce stress. 4) Keep load/support nodes fixed. 5) Use areas from given set to meet constraints. 6) Aim for a stable triangular truss with shorter members under load.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add an additional node (node_8) near the load node to reduce force in member_6. Connect node_8 to node_1, node_3, node_5, and node_7. Increase area of critical members to area_id \'4\' (3.128) or \'3\' (1.759) as needed. Remove member_6 (node_1-node_7) to avoid high stress. Connect node_7 to node_8 and node_4. This creates multiple load paths and shorter members to reduce stress. Keep existing nodes for load/support fixed.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing member_6 removes the high-stress diagonal from node_1 to node_7. Adding node_8 near node_3 and node_7 redistributes forces. Connecting node_8 to node_1 and node_5 forms stable triangles. Increasing areas on long members spreads stress and prevents overstress. Using area_id \'3\' or \'4\' balances mass and strength. This layout reduces max stress below 15 and keeps mass below 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths and areas: member_1 (node_1-node_3) length=2.0, area=3 => mass=2*1.759=3.518. member_2 (node_3-node_5), length ~2.5, area=3 => mass ~4.4. member_3 (node_5-node_4), length ~2.06, area=3 => mass ~3.6. member_4 (node_4-node_2), length=3.0, area=3 => mass=5.28. member_5 (node_5-node_2), length ~2.5, area=2 (0.782) => mass=1.955. Additional members connected to node_8 (placed at ~2.5,1.5) with area 3 or 4 to keep mass reasonable.
