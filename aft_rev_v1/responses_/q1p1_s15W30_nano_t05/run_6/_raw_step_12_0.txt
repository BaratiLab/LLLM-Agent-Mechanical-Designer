Current max stress 22.9 (exceeds), mass 27.5 (ok).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has max compressive/tensile stress above limit (member_5 at 22.9). Mass is below 30, so mass is not the main issue. The high stress is on member_5 (node_5 to node_2) tensile. The structure has multiple members around node_6 (3,2), which may cause complexity and stress concentration. Load is applied at node_3 (2,0) diagonally down-left. Current design includes nodes 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Supports fixed at nodes 1 and 2 at base line y=0. Need to reduce stress in member_5 and others, possibly by redistributing load paths and increasing truss height or adding better triangulation.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce stress on member_5 by adding alternative load paths; increase height of nodes for better force distribution; remove node_6 to simplify; keep node_7 at (3,1.5) or slightly higher; add a new node between node_3 and node_4 to improve triangulation; adjust member areas to reduce stress; use area ids 1 or 2 for less stressed members, 3 or 4 for main load carrying members.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_6 to reduce complexity. Add a new node_8 at (3.0, 2.5) to improve triangulation between node_3, node_4, and node_7. Keep nodes 1,2,3,4,5,7. Connect members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_5-node_2, node_3-node_7, node_7-node_4, node_1-node_7, node_7-node_8, node_8-node_4, node_8-node_5. Assign areas: main load paths area 3, secondary members area 1 or 2 to reduce mass. This should reduce max stress below 15 and keep mass under 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing node_6 simplifies force paths and reduces unnecessary members. Adding node_8 higher (3.0,2.5) helps create stiffer triangles, better distributing forces from load at node_3. Member areas selected to balance stress and mass. Members directly carrying load get higher area to reduce stress, others smaller to save mass. Triangulation ensures structure stability and reduces stress concentration.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths and assign areas: node_1-node_3 length=2.0, node_3-node_5 ~2.5, node_5-node_4 ~1.8, node_4-node_2=2.236, node_5-node_2 ~2.7, node_3-node_7 ~1.8, node_7-node_4 ~1.8, node_1-node_7 ~3.354, node_7-node_8=1.0, node_8-node_4 ~1.118, node_8-node_5 ~1.118.
