Current design mass=45.27 >30, max stress=9.38 <15. Load at node_3 downward-left. Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Nodes fixed at supports and load. Need lighter design with adequate load path and stiffness.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has many members and nodes increasing mass beyond limit. Stress is within limits but mass is excessive. Members with area \'3\' and \'4\' are heavy. Node_8 and its members add significant mass (member_9 area 4, mass 9.12). Structure can be simplified by removing node_8 and some redundant members. Maintain triangular bracing near load and supports for stability. Use smaller areas where stress is low. Optimize member layout to reduce member lengths and number.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_8 and members 9-12. Keep nodes 1,2,3,4,5,7. Use triangular bracing: node_3-node_7-node_4 and node_3-node_5-node_4. Use smaller areas (2 or 3) for members with low stress. Increase area only where needed to keep stress <15. Recalculate member lengths and masses to keep total mass <=30.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_8 and associated members. Use nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(4,3), node_5(2,2.5), node_7(3,2). Members: node_1-node_3(area 2), node_3-node_5(area 2), node_5-node_4(area 2), node_4-node_2(area 2), node_5-node_2(area 1), node_3-node_7(area 2), node_7-node_4(area 2), node_1-node_7(area 1). This reduces mass and maintains load path. Areas chosen to keep stress <15 and mass <30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing node_8 and its heavy members saves ~14 mass units. Using smaller areas reduces mass further. Triangular bracing with node_7 improves stability and load transfer. Members near load have area 2 (0.782) for moderate strength. Members near supports with less force have area 1 (0.195). Total member length estimated ~35 units, average area ~1.2 gives mass ~30, meeting constraints.

Mass = sum(length * area). Sum ~ (2+2.5+2.7+2.24+4.03+2.24+1.41+3.6)=20.72 length units. Using areas 0.782 or 0.195 weighted average area ~0.8 gives mass ~16.6, well below 30.
