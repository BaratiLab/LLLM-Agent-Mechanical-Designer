Members 2,3,7 have zero or negligible stress. Mass is well under limit. Node_6 at (3,2) connects node_3, node_4, and node_2 with members 6,7,8. Member_7 stress is zero, so focus on reducing stress in members 1,5,6,8 by repositioning node_6 to better distribute forces. Node_6 can move vertically and horizontally but must keep closed truss shape.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing member_1 compressive stress might be achieved by shifting node_6 slightly right and down to reduce force transfer to member_1 and member_8. Member_5 is tensile at -6.1, also can be relieved by adjusting node_6 to balance forces. Member_6 compressive -3.15 can be optimized by node_6 position. Member_7 zero stress suggests it can be reduced in area or kept same.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "By moving node_6 closer to node_2 horizontally (right) and slightly lower vertically, the length and angle of members 6,7,8 change, redistributing internal forces. This can reduce high compression in member_1 and tension in member_8. Area assignments mostly optimal; keep areas as is for now to avoid mass increase.
