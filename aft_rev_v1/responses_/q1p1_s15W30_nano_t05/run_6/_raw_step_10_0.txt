The structure is complex with many members around node_9 causing stress peaks. Areas are small in high-stress members, causing overstress. Mass is reasonable but stress violation is critical. Supports and loads fixed; node_3 load is at mid-span. The truss should better distribute forces with more direct load paths and avoid long slender members causing high stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing complexity near node_9, removing node_9, reposition node_7 closer to load path. Use truss geometry with triangular elements to distribute stresses evenly. Increase cross-sectional areas in critical members. Keep total mass under 30.
