  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss with given loads and supports meeting stress and mass constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 (-10N at -45°), supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Constraints: max stress ±15, max mass 30. Current max stress 60.99 exceeds limit, mass 18.99 under limit. Need to reduce stress especially in member_5 (node_5-node_2) which has 60.99 stress, likely tension.",
  "analysis": "Current structure has a node_6 added near center but member_5 is overstressed. Member_7 and member_4 also have significant stress but under limits. Member_5 is critical. Member_5 has smallest area (area_id=1) but high stress. Increasing area of member_5 would increase mass. Alternative is to add additional members to redistribute load or reposition node_6 to better triangulate and reduce stress in member_5. Node_5 is at (2,2.5), node_2 at (6,0). Load is at node_3 (2,0). Adding a node between node_5 and node_2 or repositioning node_6 closer to node_5-node_2 line can help. Also adding diagonal members connecting node_3 to node_2 or node_1 to node_5 can help.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try reposition node_6 closer to line between node_5 and node_2, add member from node_3 to node_2 to reduce load on member_5. Increase area of member_5 to reduce stress. Keep areas minimal to control mass. Check mass after changes.",
  "proposal": "Keep nodes 1,2,3,4,5 fixed. Move node_6 to (3.7,1.1) closer to node_5-node_2 line. Add member_9 connecting node_3 to node_2 with area 2. Increase area of member_5 to 2. Add member_10 from node_1 to node_5 with area 1 for additional support.",
  "reasoning": "Moving node_6 closer to line between node_5 and node_2 improves force path, reduces bending. Adding member_9 (node_3-node_2) provides direct load path for force at node_3 to node_2, reducing load on member_5. Increasing area of member_5 reduces stress. Member_10 (node_1-node_5) adds redundant triangulation, spreading load and reducing stress on members 1 and 5. Areas chosen to balance mass and stress. Expected mass increase acceptable within 30 limit.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: member_5 (node_5 to node_2): sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-2.5)^2) = sqrt(16+6.25)=sqrt(22.25)=4.717. Area 0.782 (id 2). Mass member_5=length*area=4.717*0.782=3.69. Member_9 (node_3 to node_2): sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-0)^2)=4.0. Area 0.782. Mass=4.0*0.782=3.13. Member_10 (node_1 to node_5): sqrt((2-0)^2 + (2.5-0)^2)=sqrt(4+6.25)=2.915. Area 0.195. Mass=2.915*0.195=0.57. Total mass increase ~7.4. Current mass 18.99 + 7.4 = 26.4 < 30. Stress expected to reduce below 15 due to better load distribution and increased area.",
  "calculation": "Member areas: member_1: 2 (0.782), member_2: 3 (1.759), member_3: 3 (1.759), member_4: 2 (0.782), member_5: 2 (0.782), member_6: 3 (1.759), member_7: 2 (0.782), member_8: 1 (0.195), member_9: 2 (0.782), member_10: 1 (0.195). Mass sum approx: (member_1 length 3.16*0.782)+(member_2 length 2.92*1.759)+(member_3 length 1.80*1.759)+(member_4 length 2.24*0.782)+(member_5 length 4.717*0.782)+(member_6 length 1.80*1.759)+(member_7 length 1.58*0.782)+(member_8 length 2.91*0.195)+(member_9 length 4.0*0.782)+(member_10 length 2.915*0.195)= approx 26.4. Max stress expected <15 after adding member_9 and increasing member_5 area, as load path is improved and member_5 stress reduced.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes or members. Node_6 moved to (3.7,1.1). Added member_9 and member_10. Areas assigned per constraints. Load and support nodes unchanged. Mass under 30. Stress expected under ±15. Structure triangulated for stability and load distribution.",
