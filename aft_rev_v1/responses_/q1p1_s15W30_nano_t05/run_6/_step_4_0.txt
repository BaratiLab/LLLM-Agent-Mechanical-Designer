  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under given load and supports with stress and mass constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 (-10N at -45deg), pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Max stress ±15, max mass 30. Current design mass 23.25, max stress 58.1 exceeds limit. Need to reduce max stress and keep mass ≤30.",

  "analysis": "Current max stress 58.1 is too high, especially in member_7 (node_3-node_4). Member areas 1 and 3 used. Member_6 also highly stressed. The structure tries to transfer load from node_3 to supports at node_1 and node_2 via nodes 4 and 5. Members with area=1 cause stress concentration. The geometry with node_5 at (2,2.5) and node_4 at (4,3) creates long members with high stresses. Mass is under limit but stress is not. Need to reduce stress by better geometry and area distribution.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, add a node to better distribute forces, increase area in critical members, and optimize geometry to shorten high-stress members. Keep load/support nodes fixed. Avoid areas 1 in high-stress members; use areas 3 or 4+. Add a node between node_3 and node_4 to reduce member length and stress. Possibly add diagonal members to triangulate better.",

  "proposal": "Add node_6 at (3.0, 1.5). Connect node_3-node_6, node_6-node_4, node_6-node_5. Increase areas of critical members to area 4 or 5. Remove member_7 (node_3-node_4) to avoid high stress there. Members: \n- member_1: node_1-node_3 area 3\n- member_2: node_3-node_5 area 3\n- member_3: node_5-node_4 area 3\n- member_4: node_4-node_2 area 3\n- member_5: node_5-node_2 area 2\n- member_6: node_1-node_4 area 1\n- member_7: node_3-node_6 area 4\n- member_8: node_6-node_4 area 4\n- member_9: node_6-node_5 area 3\n",

  "reasoning": "Adding node_6 reduces length of member_3 and member_7 in previous design, reducing stress concentration. Increasing area in new members carrying load reduces stress. Removing direct long member_7 avoids high tensile stress. Maintaining triangulation ensures stability and load transfer. Areas chosen balance mass and stress. Mass should remain below 30.",
