Current max stress 85.7 exceeds ±15 limit. Mass 13.3 < 30, so mass is acceptable. Need to reduce stress by redistributing forces and adjusting topology and member areas.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high stress in member_7 (-85.7) and excessive stresses in members_10 and 11 (48+). Members near node_7 and node_6 carry large loads with small area (area 1) causing overstress. The load is applied at node_3, which is on the bottom chord. The structure is asymmetric with multiple intermediate nodes (6,7). Many members with small area and some long members cause stress concentrations. Mass is low but stress is too high. Current topology is complex but not efficient for load transfer.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress, increase area of highly stressed members or add alternate load paths. Simplify topology to reduce stress concentrations. Move intermediate nodes slightly upward to create better triangulation and load distribution. Use larger areas on critical members. Avoid very small areas on members with high forces. Remove redundant members that add mass but not reduce stress. Keep load/support nodes fixed as per instructions.",\n  \n  "proposal": "New design keeps nodes_1,2,3 fixed. Add two intermediate nodes: node_5 at (2.0, 2.5) and node_6 at (4.0, 2.5). Connect members to form a stable triangular truss with chords and diagonals: members from node_1 to node_3, node_3 to node_5, node_5 to node_6, node_6 to node_2, and diagonals node_1-node_5, node_3-node_6, node_5-node_2. Use larger areas (area 3 or 4) on main chords and diagonals to reduce stress. Remove node_7 and node_4 to simplify. This creates a simple, stable geometry to distribute load and reduce stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular truss topology is efficient for load transfer. Intermediate nodes at 2.5 height create good triangulation. Larger cross-sections on chords and diagonals reduce stress. Simplifying the structure reduces stress concentrations and redundant members. Keeping load/support nodes fixed respects constraints. Estimated member lengths are moderate and areas chosen balance mass and stress. This design should keep max stress under ±15 and total mass under 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approx: node_1-node_3 ~2m, node_3-node_5 ~2.5m, node_5-node_6 ~2m, node_6-node_2 ~2.5m, diagonals ~3-3.5m. Areas: chords area 3 (1.759), diagonals area 4 (3.128). Estimated mass ~ sum(length*area) ~ (2*1.759 + 2.5*1.759 + 2*1.759 + 2.5*1.759) + (3*3.128 + 3.5*3.128 + 2.5*3.128) ~ 14 + 26 = 40 too high, reduce diagonal area to 2 (0.782). New mass ~ 14 + 8 = 22 < 30. Stress reduced by area increase and triangulation.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Total mass ~22. Max stress estimated <15 due to increased area and better triangulation. Members with highest forces get largest area. Members with lower forces get smaller area. Simplified topology reduces stress peaks. Load at node_3 transferred efficiently to supports via triangulated members.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes or members. Node positions fixed for load/support nodes.
