Constraints: max stress ±15, max mass 30. Current max stress 60.99 exceeds limit, mass 18.99 under limit. Need to reduce stress especially in member_5 (node_5-node_2) which has 60.99 stress, likely tension.",\n  "analysis": "Current structure has a node_6 added near center but member_5 is overstressed. Member_7 and member_4 also have significant stress but under limits. Member_5 is critical. Member_5 has smallest area (area_id=1) but high stress. Increasing area of member_5 would increase mass. Alternative is to add additional members to redistribute load or reposition node_6 to better triangulate and reduce stress in member_5. Node_5 is at (2,2.5), node_2 at (6,0). Load is at node_3 (2,0). Adding a node between node_5 and node_2 or repositioning node_6 closer to node_5-node_2 line can help. Also adding diagonal members connecting node_3 to node_2 or node_1 to node_5 can help.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try reposition node_6 closer to line between node_5 and node_2, add member from node_3 to node_2 to reduce load on member_5. Increase area of member_5 to reduce stress. Keep areas minimal to control mass. Check mass after changes.",\n  "proposal": "Keep nodes 1,2,3,4,5 fixed. Move node_6 to (3.7,1.1) closer to node_5-node_2 line. Add member_9 connecting node_3 to node_2 with area 2. Increase area of member_5 to 2. Add member_10 from node_1 to node_5 with area 1 for additional support.",\n  "reasoning": "Moving node_6 closer to line between node_5 and node_2 improves force path, reduces bending. Adding member_9 (node_3-node_2) provides direct load path for force at node_3 to node_2, reducing load on member_5. Increasing area of member_5 reduces stress. Member_10 (node_1-node_5) adds redundant triangulation, spreading load and reducing stress on members 1 and 5. Areas chosen to balance mass and stress. Expected mass increase acceptable within 30 limit.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: member_5 (node_5 to node_2): sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-2.5)^2) = sqrt(16+6.25)=sqrt(22.25)=4.717.

Member_10 (node_1 to node_5): sqrt((2-0)^2 + (2.5-0)^2)=sqrt(4+6.25)=2.915. Area 0.195. Mass=2.915*0.195=0.57. Total mass increase ~7.4. Current mass 18.99 + 7.4 = 26.4 < 30.
