  "preamble": "Optimize node 6 position to reduce max stress while keeping constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 12.6 < 15, mass 19.07 < 30. Load on node_3, supports fixed. Node_6 movable; adjust to reduce stresses in members 1,5,6,8.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is in member_1 (-12.6), member_8 (8.29), and member_5 (-6.1). Members 2,3,7 have zero or negligible stress. Mass is well under limit. Node_6 at (3,2) connects node_3, node_4, and node_2 with members 6,7,8. Member_7 stress is zero, so focus on reducing stress in members 1,5,6,8 by repositioning node_6 to better distribute forces. Node_6 can move vertically and horizontally but must keep closed truss shape.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing member_1 compressive stress might be achieved by shifting node_6 slightly right and down to reduce force transfer to member_1 and member_8. Member_5 is tensile at -6.1, also can be relieved by adjusting node_6 to balance forces. Member_6 compressive -3.15 can be optimized by node_6 position. Member_7 zero stress suggests it can be reduced in area or kept same.",
  
  "reasoning": "By moving node_6 closer to node_2 horizontally (right) and slightly lower vertically, the length and angle of members 6,7,8 change, redistributing internal forces. This can reduce high compression in member_1 and tension in member_8. Area assignments mostly optimal; keep areas as is for now to avoid mass increase. Node_6 position is key design variable to minimize max stress. Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed due to load/support. Node_4 and node_5 fixed as per instructions.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_6: (3.0, 2.0). Try shifting node_6 to (3.5, 1.7). This moves node_6 closer to node_2 (6,0) horizontally, lowers vertical coordinate to reduce bending moments. Check member lengths and expect stress reduction in members 1 and 8. Member areas unchanged: member_1 area 2, member_2 area 3, member_3 area 3, member_4 area 2, member_5 area 1, member_6 area 3, member_7 area 2, member_8 area 1.",
  
  "calculation": "Estimate member lengths with new node_6: member_6 (node_3 to node_6): sqrt((3.5-2)^2 + (1.7-0)^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 2.89) = sqrt(5.14) ~2.268. Previous length ~2.236. Slight increase. Member_7 (node_6 to node_4): sqrt((4-3.5)^2 + (3-1.7)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 1.69) = sqrt(1.94) ~1.393. Previous length ~1.414. Slight decrease. Member_8 (node_6 to node_2): sqrt((6-3.5)^2 + (0-1.7)^2) = sqrt(6.25 + 2.89) = sqrt(9.14) ~3.025. Previous length ~2.828. Slight increase. Overall mass impact minimal; total mass still below 30. Expect better force distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New node_6 position (3.5, 1.7) expected to reduce max stress below 12.6, maintain mass below 30, keep structure closed and stable, no change to load/support nodes, no duplicate members or nodes, areas unchanged. Ready to output updated design.",
