  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position and member areas to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 7.24 < 15, total mass 18.95 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved from 2.6,2.2 to 2.4,2.0 last step reduced stress. Members use areas mostly 2 and 3. Objective: reduce max stress further without increasing mass beyond 30.",
  
  "analysis": "Max compressive stress on member_1 (-7.24), tensile max on member_4 (6.21). Member_2 stress moderate (-5.43). Member_3 and member_5 stresses lower. Mass is well below limit, so area increases possible if it reduces stress. Node_4 position affects diagonal members (3,4,5) stress distribution. Current design is a 4-node closed truss with a triangle on top. Load at node_3 pulls diagonals. To reduce stress, adjust node_4 slightly upwards and right to improve force distribution and possibly increase area on high-stress members selectively.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider shifting node_4 slightly to (2.5, 2.1) to balance diagonal forces. Increase area of member_1 from 3 (1.759) to 4 (3.128) to reduce compressive stress. Keep member_2 area at 2 (0.782) to control mass. Member_4 area can stay at 2. Member_5 area can remain 3. This should reduce max stress below current 7.24 and keep mass under 30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Increasing area reduces stress by increasing cross-sectional area, reducing stress = force/area. Moving node_4 changes member lengths and angles, redistributing forces. Slight movement right/up increases length of member_3 and member_5, possibly better force distribution. Avoid large moves to keep structure stable and mass low. Prioritize reducing compressive stress on member_1 which is max stress. Mass increase from member_1 area increase is about doubling from 3.518 to ~6.3 (estimated), still acceptable.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member_1 length ~2.0 (node_1 to node_3), area 3=1.759, mass=length*area=3.518. Area 4=3.128, mass=6.256 approx. Total mass current 18.95 + (6.256-3.518)=21.688 < 30 OK. Node_4 from (2.4,2.0) to (2.5,2.1) increases lengths slightly, minor mass increase. Member_3 length increases from ~2.88 to ~3.0, area 3=1.759 mass ~5.28 to 5.28 + small increase ~5.5 still acceptable.",
  
  "calculation": "New node_4: (2.5, 2.1). Member areas: member_1: '4', member_2: '2', member_3: '3', member_4: '2', member_5: '3'. Estimated mass ~21.7 < 30. Expected max stress reduced due to increased area on member_1 and better force distribution from node_4 move. Stress likely below current max 7.24.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Check no duplicate nodes/members, load/support nodes unchanged. Closed truss with 4 nodes and 5 members. Areas selected from allowed set. Mass and max stress constraints met. Move node_4 slightly, increase member_1 area only. Stop condition not met as stress can be improved.",
