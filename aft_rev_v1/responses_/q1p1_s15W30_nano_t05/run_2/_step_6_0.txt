  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position and member areas to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 10.87 < 15, total mass 16.22 < 30, structure is stable. Load node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_4 moved from 2.4 to 2.0 in last step. Members mostly area 2 or 3.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_3 (node_1-node_4) at 10.87, tensile. Member_1 (node_1-node_3) compressive stress is -8.04. Mass is low, so some area increase possible to reduce stress. Node_4 position affects force distribution in diagonals and vertical members. Current node_4 at (3.0, 2.0) is slightly right-shifted from node_3 (2.0,0). Moving node_4 closer to node_3 horizontally and slightly higher can balance forces better. Member_2 area is 2, member_3 area is 2, member_1 area is 3. Member_3 area could be increased to reduce stress. Member_4 and member_5 areas also 2 and 3 respectively. No redundant members, structure closed. Constraints allow increasing area up to 10 (19.548).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try increasing area of member_3 from 2 to 4 (3.128 or 4.887) to reduce tensile stress. Move node_4 slightly left to reduce member_3 length and stress. Also try increasing member_4 area to reduce stress in member_3 indirectly. Keep node_3 fixed. Member_2 area can be increased from 2 to 3 to reduce compressive stress in member_2. Check mass impact. Mass budget is sufficient.",
  
  "reasoning": "Increasing cross-sectional area reduces stress for same force. Moving node_4 closer to node_3 horizontally reduces member_3 length and force. Increasing member_3 area reduces stress from 10.87 to below 10. Increasing member_2 area reduces compressive stress. Member_1 area already max at 3. Member_5 area can remain or slightly reduced if stress low. Target max stress < 10 for better margin. Keep total mass < 30.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculations: member_3 length ~ sqrt((3-0)^2 + (2-0)^2) = sqrt(9+4)=3.605. Moving node_4 to (2.6, 2.2) reduces length to sqrt((2.6)^2 + (2.2)^2) = sqrt(6.76+4.84)=3.32, 8% reduction. Area increase from 2 to 4 (3.128 to 4.887) reduces stress proportionally. Mass increase acceptable. Member_2 length fixed at 4.0 (6.0-2.0). Increase area from 2 to 3 reduces stress by 33%.",
  
  "calculation": "Move node_4 to (2.6, 2.2). Set member_3 area from '2' to '4' (4.887). Set member_2 area from '2' to '3' (1.759). Keep member_1 area at '3' (1.759). Member_4 area keep '2'. Member_5 keep '3'. Estimated max stress reduced below 10. Estimated total mass increase within limit (estimated ~18).",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Check no duplicate nodes or members. Node_3, node_1, node_2 fixed positions. Node_4 moved. Members updated areas. Structure remains closed. Max stress and mass constraints satisfied.",
