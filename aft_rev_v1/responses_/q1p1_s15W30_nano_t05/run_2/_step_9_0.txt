  "preamble": "Current design meets constraints with low max stress and acceptable mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 5.86 < 15, total mass 22.12 < 30, all constraints satisfied. Load/support nodes fixed. Members and nodes form closed truss.",
  
  "analysis": "Stress is well below limits; mass is moderate. Member_1 area increased to 4 to reduce stress. Node_4 positioned at (2.5,2.1) balances geometry. No member stress near limits, no mass limit exceeded.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further node moves risk increasing stress or mass. Area adjustments limited by discrete set. Current layout stable with balanced forces.",
  
  "reasoning": "Minimizing stress further would require reducing member areas or repositioning nodes. But reducing areas risks violating stress constraints. Moving node_4 further risks increasing stress in members 4 or 5. Current max stress is low with balanced tensile/compressive forces. Mass is well below max.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas yield current mass 22.12. Max stress 5.86 on member_4 is moderate. Member_1 area 4 (3.128 to 4) reduced stress from previous iteration. No member stress near 15 limit, no mass near 30 limit.",
  
  "calculation": "Member lengths approx: m1=2.69, m2=4.0, m3=3.25, m4=4.0, m5=2.3. Areas: m1=4(3.128), m2=2(0.782), m3=3(1.759), m4=2(0.782), m5=3(1.759). Total mass = sum(length*area) â‰ˆ 22.12. Max stress 5.86 < 15. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met, max stress minimized given discrete areas and node positions. Further optimization unlikely to improve without violating constraints or changing fixed nodes.",
