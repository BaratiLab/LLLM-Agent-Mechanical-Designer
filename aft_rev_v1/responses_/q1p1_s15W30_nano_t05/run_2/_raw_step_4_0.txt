Current max stress 20.15 exceeds ±15 limit. Mass 15.3 is acceptable. Need to reduce stress on member_2 and member_5, which are overstressed in tension and compression respectively.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has node_4 at (2.0, 2.4) connecting nodes 1,2,3. Member_2 (node_3 to node_2) is overstressed (-20.15). Member_5 (node_3 to node_4) also high stress (-9.04). Member_2 area is 0.195, possibly undersized for load. Member_5 area is 0.782. The vertical height of node_4 is moderate. Existing design tries to triangulate but fails stress limits. Mass is well below max, so increasing member areas or adding members is feasible.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Options: increase area of member_2 and member_5 to reduce stress, or add a new node to better distribute load. Node_3 is load node, can\'t move it. Node_1 and 2 are supports and fixed. Adding a node between node_3 and node_2 higher up could reduce member_2 stress. Use higher area for critical members. Avoid increasing mass beyond 30.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node_5 at (4.0, 1.8) to form two triangles: node_3-node_5-node_2 and node_4-node_5-node_2. Remove member_2 (node_3-node_2) to reduce direct stress. Connect node_3-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_4-node_5. Increase area of members with high stress to reduce stress below 15. Keep member_1, member_3, member_4, member_5 with adjusted areas. This redistributes load and reduces peak stress on member_2.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Introducing node_5 near load path increases load path length and provides alternate stress paths. Removing direct member_2 reduces its overstress. Triangulation improves stability and load distribution. Increasing member areas on critical members reduces stress.
