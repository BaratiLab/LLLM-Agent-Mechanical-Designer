  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position and member areas to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 9.04 < 15; total mass 17.17 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 lowered from 3.0 to 2.2 reduced mass but stress increased. Member_5 most stressed (-9.04).",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress concentrated in member_5 (node_3-node_4). Member_5 area is 2 (0.782). Reducing node_4 height reduces mass but increases stress. To reduce stress, node_4 should be repositioned to better distribute forces and member areas adjusted. Load and support nodes fixed; only node_4 can move. Member_5 length and orientation affect stress. Increasing node_4 y slightly may reduce stress. Also, reassigning member_5 area to a higher area reduces stress. Member_3 and member_4 areas can be adjusted to balance mass and stress. Aim to keep mass under 30 and stress under 15.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try increasing node_4 y from 2.2 to ~2.5 to reduce stress in member_5. Increase member_5 area from 2 to 3 or 4 for stress reduction. Possibly reduce member_3 area from 3 to 2 to compensate mass. Keep member_1 and member_2 areas unchanged as stresses are moderate.",
  
  "reasoning": "Increasing node_4 y increases member_5 length, reducing axial force and stress. Increasing member_5 area reduces stress by increasing cross-sectional area. Reducing member_3 area balances total mass. Member_4 area may be kept or slightly reduced if stress allows. This balances mass and stress to optimize design.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4 y: 2.5 (from 2.2). Member_5 area: 3 (1.759), member_3 area: 2 (0.782), member_4 area: 2 (0.782). Member lengths estimated roughly: member_5 length ~ sqrt((2-2)^2 + (2.5-0)^2) = 2.5, member_3 length ~ sqrt((2-0)^2 + (2.5-0)^2) ~ 3.2, member_4 length ~ sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-2.5)^2) ~ 4.7. Mass approx: member_5: 2.5*1.759=4.4, member_3:3.2*0.782=2.5, member_4:4.7*0.782=3.7, member_1:3.518, member_2:3.128. Total mass ~ 3.518+3.128+2.5+3.7+4.4=17.25 < 30. Stress expected to reduce in member_5 due to increased area and length.",
  
  "calculation": "Adjusted node_4 to (2.0, 2.5). Changed member_5 area to '3' from '2'. Changed member_3 and member_4 areas to '2' from '3' and '2' respectively. Member_1 and member_2 areas unchanged. Expected max stress < 9, total mass ~17.25. All constraints met.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved up to reduce stress concentration on member_5. Member_5 area increased to reduce stress. Member_3 and member_4 areas reduced to balance mass. Load and support nodes fixed. Closed truss maintained with current members. No duplicates. Design likely improved but further iteration possible.",
