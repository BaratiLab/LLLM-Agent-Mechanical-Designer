Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 lowered from 3.0 to 2.2 reduced mass but stress increased. Member_5 most stressed (-9.04).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress concentrated in member_5 (node_3-node_4). Member_5 area is 2 (0.782). Reducing node_4 height reduces mass but increases stress. To reduce stress, node_4 should be repositioned to better distribute forces and member areas adjusted. Load and support nodes fixed; only node_4 can move. Member_5 length and orientation affect stress. Increasing node_4 y slightly may reduce stress. Also, reassigning member_5 area to a higher area reduces stress. Member_3 and member_4 areas can be adjusted to balance mass and stress. Aim to keep mass under 30 and stress under 15.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try increasing node_4 y from 2.2 to ~2.5 to reduce stress in member_5. Increase member_5 area from 2 to 3 or 4 for stress reduction. Possibly reduce member_3 area from 3 to 2 to compensate mass. Keep member_1 and member_2 areas unchanged as stresses are moderate.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing node_4 y increases member_5 length, reducing axial force and stress. Increasing member_5 area reduces stress by increasing cross-sectional area. Reducing member_3 area balances total mass. Member_4 area may be kept or slightly reduced if stress allows.
