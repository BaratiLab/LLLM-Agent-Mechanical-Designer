Current mass 31.996 >30. Max stress 5.8 <15, so stress is safe. Need to reduce mass by ~2 units. Load at node_3 downward-left. Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Nodes fixed: node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4. Members connect these nodes with areas 2-4. Current design has member_3 (node_1-node_4) area 4 (3.128 mass units), member_4 (node_4-node_2) area 3 (1.759 mass units), member_5 (node_3-node_4) area 3 (1.759 mass units) large areas causing high mass. Node_4 at (2,3) is only vertical node. Need to reduce member areas and possibly reposition node_4 for better force path and reduce mass.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design is stable but slightly overweight. Max stress is well under limits, so member areas can be reduced. Node_4 can be lowered slightly to reduce member lengths and thus mass. Member_3 and member_4 can have smaller cross sections. Member_5 can also be reduced. Member_1 and member_2 carry horizontal spans and should maintain moderate area. Adding one additional node to create a triangular bracing may reduce member lengths and mass. But since constraints allow only repositioning of node_4 and adding nodes except load/support nodes, adding node_5 near node_3 and node_4 to create a stiffer truss could help. However, simpler approach is to reduce member areas and move node_4 down to reduce mass below 30.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce areas: member_3 from 4 to 3, member_4 from 3 to 2, member_5 from 3 to 2. Move node_4 from (2,3) to (2,2.2) to reduce member lengths. Check new lengths and mass. Members lengths approx: m3 ~ sqrt((2-0)^2+(2.2-0)^2)=~3.02, m4 ~ sqrt((6-2)^2+(0-2.2)^2)=~4.44, m5 ~ sqrt((2-2)^2+(2.2-0)^2)=2.2. Calculate mass: m3=3.02*3.128=9.45, m4=4.44*0.782=3.47, m5=2.2*0.782=1.72, m1=2*1.759=3.52, m2=4*0.782=3.13. Sum=9.45+3.47+1.72+3.52+3.13=21.29 <30, good margin. Stress should remain under limits due to reduced areas and lengths.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep nodes node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Move node_4 to (2,2.2). Members: member_1: node_1-node_3 area 3 (1.759), member_2: node_3-node_2 area 2 (0.782), member_3: node_1-node_4 area 3 (1.759), member_4: node_4-node_2 area 2 (0.782), member_5: node_3-node_4 area 2 (0.782). This reduces mass to ~21.3 and keeps stresses within limits.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Reducing node_4 height reduces member lengths and thus mass. Reducing cross sections reduces mass further while max stress is well below limits, so safety is maintained. Member areas chosen from allowed discrete set. Node positions for load and supports fixed, node_4 repositioned to optimize force distribution and mass. Members maintain truss stability with triangular bracing. This design meets constraints and optimizes mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: m1=|node_1-node_3|=2, m2=|node_3-node_2|=4, m3=3.02, m4=4.44, m5=2.2. Areas: m1=3, m2=2, m3=3, m4=2, m5=2. Mass=Σ length*area factor=2*1.759 + 4*0.782 + 3.02*1.759 + 4.44*0.782 + 2.2*0.782 = 3.518 + 3.128 + 5.31 + 3.47 + 1.72 = 17.15 approx (recalculated carefully). This is well under 30.

Total=3.518+3.128+5.31+3.47+1.72=17.15 <30. Max stress from previous 5.8 is well below 15, so reducing areas maintains safety. Node_4 lowered reducing member lengths and mass.
