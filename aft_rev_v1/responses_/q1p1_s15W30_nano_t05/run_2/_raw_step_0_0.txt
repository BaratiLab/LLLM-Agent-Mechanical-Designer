Load at node_3 downward-left (-10, -45°). Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Need closed truss (all nodes connected forming at least one closed loop). Max stress ±15, max mass 30. Areas discrete from 0:1 to 10:19.548. No node position changes for given nodes. Need to add nodes if needed to form closed structure. Simple truss with 3 nodes is a line, not closed. Need to add at least one node above or below to close loop.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Given 3 collinear nodes, truss is open line. To form closed loop, add node_4 above line to form triangle. Place node_4 near load node_3 vertically to reduce moment and stress. Connect members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4, plus base members node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2. This creates a closed triangular structure with a diagonal member to distribute load. Use areas to keep stress within ±15 and mass ≤30. Approximate member lengths and forces by static equilibrium and simple truss assumptions.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_4 placed at (2.0, 3.0) above node_3.

Assign areas starting small and increase if stress >15. Calculate mass = Σ(length × area).",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_4 at (2.0,3.0) creates stable triangle with node_1 and node_2. Load at node_3 is transferred through members connected to node_4 and base. The diagonal members reduce bending and distribute stresses. Areas chosen to keep stress ≤15 by increasing cross-section on high force members. Mass kept ≤30 by limiting area on longer members. Assumed linear elastic behavior, axial forces only, no bending.
