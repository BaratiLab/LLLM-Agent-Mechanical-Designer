Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Current max stress 47 > 15 limit, mass 32.6 > 30 limit. Need lighter, less stressed design. Nodes fixed at supports and load; can add/move others.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design adds node_5 between node_3 and node_2 with large area members causing high compressive stress (-47) in member_4 (node_4-node_2). Mass exceeds limit due to large areas (3,4). Previous simpler truss iterations had lower mass but stress still too high or near limit. Current layout has long members with large areas leading to excessive compressive stress. To reduce stress, redistribute load via more triangular bracing and smaller cross sections. Avoid large direct compression members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider removing node_5 and redesigning with 4 nodes: supports node_1, node_2, load node_3, plus a new node above load to create two triangles. Use smaller areas for compression members. Adjust node height to balance forces, reduce compression in bottom chord. Use area ids 1-3 mostly to keep mass low. Aim max stress ±15, mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_5. Add node_4 at (3.0, 2.0) above load node_3. Connect: member_1: node_1-node_3 area 3, member_2: node_3-node_2 area 2, member_3: node_1-node_4 area 2, member_4: node_4-node_2 area 2, member_5: node_3-node_4 area 3. This forms two triangles sharing node_4. Smaller areas reduce mass and stress. Node_4 position at 3.0, 2.0 balances load path. This simpler truss reduces compression in bottom chord and distributes forces.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular truss with node_4 above load node_3 creates direct load path to supports with less bending. Smaller cross sections reduce mass and stress. Avoid long compression members with large area. Node_4 at 3.0,2.0 is midpoint horizontally between nodes 1 and 2, height chosen to optimize force distribution. Using area ids 2 and 3 balances strength and weight.
