Total mass well below max. Node_4 position affects stress distribution significantly. Member_3 mass dropped from 5.23 to 2.5 by reducing area from 3 to 2, but stress increased on member_3. Current layout is a quadrilateral with diagonal member_5. Load at node_3 downward-left at 45 degrees.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider slightly adjusting node_4 vertical position between 2.3 and 2.5 to reduce member_3 stress. Possibly increase area of member_3 to 3 to reduce stress while controlling mass by reducing area elsewhere. Member_5 area 3 may be reduced to 2 if stress allows. Member_1 area 3 seems necessary for compression. Member_2 area 2 is low stress, could reduce to 1 if stress allows.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing node_4 height increases member_3 length and reduces its stress. But too high increases member_4 length and stress. Optimal node_4 y likely near 2.4. Area trade-off: member_3 area 3 reduces stress but increases mass. Member_5 area 3 can be reduced if stress low. Member_2 area can be reduced if stress low. Member_1 area 3 needed for compression. Aim to balance areas to keep mass low and stress balanced. Small vertical adjustment of node_4 and area tuning can lower max stress below current 7.72.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: m1 (node_1-node_3): 2.0, m2 (node_3-node_2): 4.0, m3 (node_1-node_4): sqrt(2^2 + y^2), m4 (node_4-node_2): sqrt((6-2)^2 + y^2), m5 (node_3-node_4): sqrt((2-2)^2 + y^2).
