Member_4 has low tensile stress (3.12) despite large area (3). Member_5 moderate tensile stress (4.9). Members 1 and 2 have moderate compressive stresses. Node_4 moved closer to node_1 and lowered in last iteration, increasing stress in member_3. Mass increased due to member_4 large area and length.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing member_3 stress may require repositioning node_4 upward and slightly right to reduce compressive force. Possibly reduce area of member_4 from 3 to 2 to save mass and redistribute stresses. Member_3 area currently 2, could consider increasing to 3 if stress reduces overall. Member_1 area 3 seems stable.",\n\n  "reasoning": "By moving node_4 slightly higher and more centered between node_1 and node_2, member_3 length and compressive force may reduce. Reducing member_4 area from 3 to 2 can reduce mass and tensile stress, potentially redistributing forces. Member_3 area may increase to 3 to lower stress by increasing cross section. Member_5 area 2 is reasonable. Member_2 area 2 is stable. Member_1 area 3 is maintained for stability.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4 move from (1.9, 3.2) to approx (2.0, 3.4).

Member_4 length from node_1(0,0) to node_4(2,3.4) ~3.91. Member_3 area increase offsets stress. Member_4 area decrease reduces mass and tensile stress.
