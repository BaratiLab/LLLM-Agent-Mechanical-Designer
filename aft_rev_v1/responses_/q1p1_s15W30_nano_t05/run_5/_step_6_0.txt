  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position and member areas to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress is 9.05 < 15, total mass 19.76 < 30; load at node_3, supports fixed; node_4 movable; member_3 has highest compressive stress (-9.05).",

  "analysis": "Member_3 is critical with max compressive stress. Member_4 has low tensile stress (3.12) despite large area (3). Member_5 moderate tensile stress (4.9). Members 1 and 2 have moderate compressive stresses. Node_4 moved closer to node_1 and lowered in last iteration, increasing stress in member_3. Mass increased due to member_4 large area and length.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing member_3 stress may require repositioning node_4 upward and slightly right to reduce compressive force. Possibly reduce area of member_4 from 3 to 2 to save mass and redistribute stresses. Member_3 area currently 2, could consider increasing to 3 if stress reduces overall. Member_1 area 3 seems stable.",

  "reasoning": "By moving node_4 slightly higher and more centered between node_1 and node_2, member_3 length and compressive force may reduce. Reducing member_4 area from 3 to 2 can reduce mass and tensile stress, potentially redistributing forces. Member_3 area may increase to 3 to lower stress by increasing cross section. Member_5 area 2 is reasonable. Member_2 area 2 is stable. Member_1 area 3 is maintained for stability.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4 move from (1.9, 3.2) to approx (2.0, 3.4). Member areas: member_1:3, member_2:2, member_3:3, member_4:2, member_5:2. Check length changes: member_3 length ~ from node_3(2,0) to node_4(2,3.4) = 3.4. Member_4 length from node_1(0,0) to node_4(2,3.4) ~3.91. Member_3 area increase offsets stress. Member_4 area decrease reduces mass and tensile stress. Total mass estimated to remain < 30.",

  "calculation": "Member lengths: m1=2 (node_1 to node_3), m2=4 (node_3 to node_2), m3=3.4, m4=3.91, m5=3.7 (node_4 to node_2). Member masses: m1=2*1.759=3.518, m2=4*0.782=3.128, m3=3.4*1.759=5.98, m4=3.91*0.782=3.06, m5=3.7*0.782=2.89. Total mass approx 18.56 < 30. Expected stress reduction in member_3 due to larger area and repositioning. Member_4 stress expected to reduce due to smaller area.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met: max stress < 15, mass < 30. Node positions and member areas updated to reduce max stress. Node_4 repositioned upward and centered. Member_3 area increased to reduce compressive stress. Member_4 area decreased to reduce tensile stress and mass. Stop=False to allow further refinement if needed.",
