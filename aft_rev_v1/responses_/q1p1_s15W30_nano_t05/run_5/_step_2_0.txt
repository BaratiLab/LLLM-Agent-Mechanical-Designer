  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position and member areas to reduce max stress while staying within mass limit.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 6.94 well below Â±15, total mass 20.11 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved up to 3.5 from 3.0 reduced stress significantly. Members use moderate areas 2-3. Objective is to further reduce max stress by repositioning node_4 and adjusting areas.",
  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_4 (node_1-node_4) at 6.94 tensile, others lower. Member_4 area is 2 (0.782). Increasing area on member_4 can reduce stress but increases mass. Node_4 vertical position affects force distribution; increasing height helped reduce stress previously. Horizontal position of node_4 can be adjusted slightly within constraints to improve force paths. Member_3 and member_1 have compressive stresses around -4 to -5.5. Member_2 and member_5 are lower stress. Total mass is 20.11, so room exists to increase area on critical members to reduce stress further.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_4 slightly right (x>2.0) to provide better load path to node_2 (roller). Increase area of member_4 from 2 (0.782) to 3 (1.759) to reduce stress. Possibly reduce area of low stress members to compensate mass. Keep node_3 fixed (load node), node_1 and node_2 fixed (supports).",
  "reasoning": "Increasing area reduces stress linearly by increasing cross section. Moving node_4 right reduces bending moment on member_4 by improving geometry. Member_1 and member_3 areas can be adjusted to balance mass and stress. Member_2 and member_5 have low stress, areas can be decreased if needed to compensate mass increase elsewhere. Node_4 vertical position can be maintained near 3.5 but slight horizontal shift beneficial.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: member_4 length from node_1(0,0) to node_4(2.0,3.5) approx sqrt(2^2 + 3.5^2)=4.031. Increasing node_4 x to 2.5 increases length to sqrt(2.5^2 +3.5^2)=4.301. Slight increase in length increases mass but may reduce stress. Member areas currently: member_4=2 (0.782), member_1=3 (1.759), member_3=3 (1.759), member_2=2 (0.782), member_5=2 (0.782).",
  "calculation": "Adjust node_4 to (2.5, 3.5). Change member_4 area from 2 to 3 to reduce stress. Reduce member_3 area from 3 to 2 to compensate mass increase. Member_1 area remains 3. Member_2 and member_5 remain 2. Calculate new approximate mass: member_4 length 4.301 * area 1.759=7.56 (was 3.152), member_3 length ~4.031 * area 0.782=3.15 (was 6.156), net mass change ~+4.4 -3 = +1.4 approx mass increase. Total mass ~21.5 still <30. Expect max stress reduced on member_4 due to increased area and better geometry.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved right to 2.5, up 3.5. Member_4 area up to 3, member_3 area down to 2. Other members unchanged. Mass within limits, stress expected to reduce further. No violation of constraints. Optimization can continue if needed but improvement significant.",
