Load at node_3, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Node_3 can move only vertically or horizontally? Instruction says load/support nodes fixed. Node_4 movable. Members mostly area 2 and 4, heavier member_3 area 4. Need to reduce max stress member_1 (-13.06).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max compressive stress in member_1 is close to limit. Member_1 connects node_1 (0,0) to node_3 (2,0). Member_3 (node_3 to node_4) has low stress, area 4 large mass. Member_4 and member_5 have moderate tensile stress. To reduce stress in member_1, consider adjusting node_4 position to redistribute forces and possibly reduce member_1 load. Increasing height of node_4 may reduce compression in member_1 by increasing load path through member_3 and members connected to node_4. Also, consider reducing area in low stress members to reduce mass and allow area increase in member_1 to reduce stress. But instruction 6 forbids moving load/support nodes, so node_3 fixed at (2,0).",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try moving node_4 upward slightly to increase vertical component in member_3, reducing compression in member_1.

Increasing member_1 area from 0.782 to 1.759 (area id 3) reduces stress. Reducing member_3 area from 4 to 3 reduces mass, compensating area increase in member_1.
