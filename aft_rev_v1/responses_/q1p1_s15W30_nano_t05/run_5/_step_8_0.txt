  "preamble": "Current truss meets constraints with low max stress and acceptable mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 6.94 < 15, total mass 20.11 < 30, all stresses well within limits. Load at node_3 fixed, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_4 moved slightly in previous iterations to optimize stress and mass.",
  
  "analysis": "The current design has max stress 6.94, well below allowable 15. Mass is 20.11, below 30 max. Stress distribution is balanced with no member overstressed. Node_4 is at (2.0, 3.5), which seems optimal for load transfer and stress minimization given load at node_3. Member areas are chosen reasonably with higher areas on critical members. Further node movement is limited by load/support constraints and closed truss requirement.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further optimization by moving node_4 or changing member areas unlikely to reduce max stress significantly without increasing mass or violating constraints. Current design stable and efficient.",
  
  "reasoning": "Node_1 and node_2 fixed due to supports. Load at node_3 fixed. Only node_4 can be moved. Previous attempts to move node_4 around (2.0, 3.5) showed that max stress fluctuates but does not improve significantly. Member areas chosen to keep mass low while controlling stress. Stress levels are well below limits, so structure is not overdesigned. Further reduction in stress would require larger areas and higher mass or complex geometry changes violating closed truss condition or node constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Max stress = 6.94 < 15 allowable; total mass = 20.11 < 30 allowable. Member areas: member_1 and member_3 at area 3 (1.759), member_2,4,5 at area 2 (0.782). Lengths and masses consistent with geometry. No duplicated nodes or members. Closed truss maintained.",
  
  "calculation": "No changes to node positions or member areas recommended. Current design achieves objective with margin. Stress and mass constraints satisfied. Further optimization iterations unlikely to yield significant improvement without violating constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verified constraints adherence, no duplicated nodes/members, load/support nodes fixed. Node_4 at (2.0, 3.5) optimal placement. Members and areas consistent. Stop optimization.",
