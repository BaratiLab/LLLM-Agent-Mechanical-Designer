  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss with fixed nodes and supports, minimize stress within ±15 and mass ≤30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given 3 nodes: node_1(0,0, pinned), node_2(6,0, roller), node_3(2,0, loaded with -10N at -45°. Objective: closed truss with minimal stress and mass ≤30.",
  
  "analysis": "Nodes are colinear on x-axis. To form a closed truss, add nodes above baseline to form triangles. Load at node_3 downward-left suggests tension/compression in members connected to node_3. Supports fix horizontal and vertical reactions. Use triangular topology for stability. Avoid long slender members to limit stress. Use minimal areas to reduce mass but enough to keep stress ≤15. Member length × area sum ≤30. Use areas from given discrete set.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Add one node above node_3 to form two triangles: node_4 at (2.0, y). Connect node_4 to nodes 1,2,3. Members: (1-3), (3-2), (1-4), (4-2), (3-4). Check lengths, assign areas to keep stress ≤15 and mass ≤30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Closed truss requires at least one node above baseline to form triangular closed shape. Node_4 placed above node_3 at y>0. Triangles: (1-3-4), (3-2-4) ensure stability. Load at node_3 creates tension in (3-4) and compression in (1-3), (3-2). Use static equilibrium to estimate member forces. Assign areas to keep stresses ≤15. Mass approximated as sum(length × area).",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Load at node_3 is -10N at -45° (down-left). Decompose load: Fx = -10*cos45° ≈ -7.07N, Fy = -10*sin45° ≈ -7.07N. Supports react accordingly. Members carry axial forces only. Use truss analysis (method of joints) at node_3 and node_4. Use length = Euclidean distance. Stress = force/area. Force approximated by equilibrium. Choose areas from given set to keep stress ≤15. Mass = sum(length × area).",
