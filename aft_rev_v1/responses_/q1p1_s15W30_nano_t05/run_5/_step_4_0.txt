  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position and member areas to reduce max stress while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 9.08 < 15, mass 20.19 < 30; goal: reduce max stress further by adjusting node_4 position and member areas.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_3 (-9.08). Member_4 has low stress (3.27) but high mass (7.08). Node_4 moved from (2.5,3.5) to (2.3,3.3) decreased mass and stress slightly. Load and support nodes fixed. Members 1 and 4 have area_id '3' (1.759), members 2,3,5 have '2' (0.782). Member_4 is relatively heavy; reducing its area or shortening length may help. Node_4 can be moved slightly to rebalance forces and reduce stress on member_3 and member_4. Member_3 stress is compressive and near max, so shortening member_3 or increasing its area may reduce stress. Member_4 is under tension with moderate stress; reducing length or area may reduce mass but may increase stress elsewhere.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try moving node_4 slightly closer to node_3 to reduce member_3 length; adjust member_4 length by slight reposition of node_4; consider reducing member_4 area from 3 to 2 if stress permits; keep member_3 area at 2 or increase to 3 if needed; member_5 area at 2 is fine; member_1 area at 3 is fine.",
  
  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 closer to node_3 reduces member_3 length, reducing compressive stress. Slight vertical lowering reduces member_4 length and mass. Increasing member_3 area from 2 to 3 reduces stress. Decreasing member_4 area from 3 to 2 reduces mass with acceptable stress increase. Member_1 area remains at 3 for stiffness. Member_2 and member_5 area remain at 2. Node_3 fixed at (2.0,0.0) as load node; node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_4 new position optimized to balance member lengths and forces.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4 from (2.3,3.3) to approx (2.1,3.0). Member_3 length reduces from ~3.3 to ~3.04. Member_4 length reduces from ~3.7 to ~3.35. Member_3 area from 2 (0.782) to 3 (1.759). Member_4 area from 3 (1.759) to 2 (0.782). Mass estimated as sum(length*area_id factor). Stress expected to reduce on member_3 due to area increase and length decrease. Member_4 stress may increase but stay below 15.",
  
  "calculation": "Member lengths approx: m3 = sqrt((2.1-2)^2 + (3.0-0)^2) = 3.04, m4 = sqrt((2.1-0)^2 + (3.0-0)^2) = 3.35. Mass m3 = 3.04*1.759=5.35, m4=3.35*0.782=2.62. Previous m3 mass 2.59, m4 mass 7.08. Total mass reduction from member_4 area decrease outweighs member_3 mass increase. Max stress expected to drop below 9 due to increased area and shorter length on member_3. Stress on member_4 may increase but remain below 7. Constraints met.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New node_4 at (2.1,3.0), member_3 area '3', member_4 area '2', other members unchanged. Expected max stress <9, total mass < 21. This improves stress and mass balance. Further optimization possible but diminishing returns. Continue optimization next iteration.",
