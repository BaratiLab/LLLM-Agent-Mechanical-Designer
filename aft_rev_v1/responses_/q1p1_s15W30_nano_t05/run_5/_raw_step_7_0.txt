Load at node_3, supports fixed. Need to minimize max stress further by adjusting node_4 y-position only.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_4 (node_1-node_4) at 6.99 tensile, which is relatively high. Member_3 and member_1 have moderate compressive stress around -5.6 to -4.0. Member_2 and member_5 are less stressed. Node_4 moved from 1.9 to 2.0 to 3.4 y-coordinate over iterations, stress reduced from ~9 to ~7. Now at 3.4 y. Increasing y further might reduce compression in member_4 by changing force distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Check if slight increase or decrease in node_4 y-position can reduce tensile stress in member_4 and compressive stress in member_3, member_1. Node_4 x fixed at 2.0 to maintain geometry. Avoid large changes to keep mass stable.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_4 stress depends on vertical component of node_4. Increasing node_4 y slightly may reduce tensile stress in member_4 by better force distribution through members 3 and 5. Member areas kept same to keep mass stable. Minor y adjustment of node_4 within 3.3-3.6 range could optimize stress balance. Avoid lowering node_4 y as it increased max stress before.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: member_4 length ~ sqrt((2.0)^2 + y^2). Increasing y increases length and mass slightly but may reduce stress. Check mass impact and max stress tradeoff.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Current member_4 length ~ sqrt(2^2 + 3.4^2) = sqrt(4 + 11.56) = sqrt(15.56) ~ 3.945. Slight increase to y=3.5: length ~ sqrt(4 + 12.25) = sqrt(16.25) ~ 4.03. Mass increase minimal. Stress expected to reduce by better load path. Other members lengths stable. Total mass expected ~19.9 max, under 30 limit.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Plan: Move node_4 from (2.0, 3.4) to (2.0, 3.5), keep all members and areas same.
