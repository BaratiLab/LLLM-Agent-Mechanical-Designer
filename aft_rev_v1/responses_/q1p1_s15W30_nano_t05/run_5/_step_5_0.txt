  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position and member areas to reduce max stress under constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 7.36 < 15, total mass 18.64 < 30. Node_4 moved down from prior higher positions, member_3 area increased to 3, member_4 area decreased to 2 to balance stress and mass.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_4 (7.36 tensile). Member_4 connects node_1 (fixed) to node_4 (movable). Moving node_4 closer to node_1 horizontally and slightly adjusting vertically can reduce member_4 stress. Member_3 and member_4 areas swapped in recent iterations; member_3 area increase increased mass. Member_3 stress is compressive ~4.0. Member_1 stress compressive ~5.9. Member_5 stress moderate tensile ~4.9. Member_2 stress moderate compressive ~3.9. All within limits. Mass is well below max 30, so room to increase areas if needed to reduce stress. Load at node_3 fixed, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_3 fixed at (2,0), node_1 at (0,0), node_2 at (6,0).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_4 slightly left (reduce x from 2.1 to ~1.9) and slightly up (from 3.0 to ~3.2) to better align members and reduce bending moments. Keep member_1 and member_2 areas as is. Possibly increase member_4 area to 3 to reduce stress. Member_3 area can be reduced to 2 to save mass. This swap can lower max stress on member_4 and keep total mass low. Verify no member exceeds Â±15 stress after adjustment.",
  
  "reasoning": "Stress in member_4 is highest; increasing its area reduces stress. Moving node_4 closer horizontally to node_1 reduces length and bending, lowering stress. Increasing vertical coordinate slightly improves load path. Member_3 area reduced to compensate mass increase. Member_1 and member_2 areas stable to maintain stiffness near supports. Member_5 area unchanged as stress moderate and mass balanced. Node_3 and supports fixed, no change allowed. This approach balances stress reduction and mass constraints while maintaining closed truss topology.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current member lengths: member_4 ~ sqrt((2.1-0)^2 + (3-0)^2) = ~3.69. Reducing x to 1.9 and y to 3.2: length ~ sqrt(1.9^2 + 3.2^2) = sqrt(3.61+10.24)= sqrt(13.85)=3.72, slightly longer but better angle. Member_4 area from '2' (0.782) to '3' (1.759) doubles area, halves stress approx. Member_3 length sqrt((2-2)^2 + (0-3.2)^2)=3.2, area reduced from '3' (1.759) to '2' (0.782) saves mass. Check total mass impact: member_4 mass ~ length * area ~3.72*1.759=6.54, member_3 mass ~3.2*0.782=2.5, net increase ~0.7 mass but still under 30.",
  
  "calculation": "Adjust node_4 to (1.9, 3.2). Set member_4 area to '3', member_3 area to '2'. Keep other members same areas: member_1 '3', member_2 '2', member_5 '2'. Expected max stress reduces from 7.36 to ~5-6 due to increased member_4 area and improved geometry. Total mass estimated ~19-20, still below 30. Stress distribution more balanced. All constraints met.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes, member connections unchanged except areas. Node_4 position changed as allowed. Load/support nodes unchanged. Closed truss maintained. Constraints met: max stress <15, mass <30. Continue optimization as stress can be further reduced.",
