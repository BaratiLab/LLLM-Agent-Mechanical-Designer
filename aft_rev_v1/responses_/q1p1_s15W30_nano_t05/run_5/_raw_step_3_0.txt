Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved from (2,3.5) to (2.5,3.5) raised stress on member_3. Need to reduce stress on member_3 (currently -9.13).",\n  "analysis": "Member_3 (node_3-node_4) has highest compressive stress. Increasing vertical height of node_4 increased stress. Moving node_4 horizontally closer to node_3 or slightly lowering node_4 may reduce member_3 stress. Also, member_4 (node_1-node_4) has low tensile stress, can increase its length to balance forces. Member areas mostly small to medium, consider increasing area of member_3 to reduce stress or reposition node_4 to reduce force demand.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try moving node_4 slightly left from 2.5 to ~2.3 and slightly down from 3.5 to ~3.3 to reduce member_3 length and stress. Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Areas remain same or slightly increase member_3 area from \'2\' to \'3\' if needed.",\n  "reasoning": "Reducing member_3 length reduces axial force demand and stress. Slight horizontal shift left reduces bending moment at node_3. Slight vertical lowering reduces eccentricity. Increasing member_3 area reduces stress but increases mass. Tradeoff: small position change preferred first. Keeping closed truss with 5 members is optimal for simplicity and load path.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: member_3 length = distance(node_3 to node_4). Current node_4 (2.5,3.5), node_3 (2,0), length ~3.54. Move node_4 to (2.3,3.3), length ~3.19 (shorter by ~0.35). Stress ~ force/area/length, shorter length reduces force demand. Area \'2\' (0.782) kept same. Mass = length * area * density factor, mass decreases slightly. Expected max stress reduction from ~9.13 to ~7.5-8.0.",\n  "calculation": "New node_4 = (2.3, 3.3). Members unchanged except member_3 area remains \'2\'. Mass estimate: member_3 length 3.19*0.782=2.5 approx vs previous 2.76. Total mass slightly reduced. Max stress expected ~8.0 or less. Other member stresses remain within limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met: max stress < 15, total mass < 30. Load and supports fixed. No duplicate nodes or members.
