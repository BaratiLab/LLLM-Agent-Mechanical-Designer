  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress further within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 6.99 < 15, total mass 19.82 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Need to minimize max stress further by adjusting node_4 y-position only.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_4 (node_1-node_4) at 6.99 tensile, which is relatively high. Member_3 and member_1 have moderate compressive stress around -5.6 to -4.0. Member_2 and member_5 are less stressed. Node_4 moved from 1.9 to 2.0 to 3.4 y-coordinate over iterations, stress reduced from ~9 to ~7. Now at 3.4 y. Increasing y further might reduce compression in member_4 by changing force distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Check if slight increase or decrease in node_4 y-position can reduce tensile stress in member_4 and compressive stress in member_3, member_1. Node_4 x fixed at 2.0 to maintain geometry. Avoid large changes to keep mass stable.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_4 stress depends on vertical component of node_4. Increasing node_4 y slightly may reduce tensile stress in member_4 by better force distribution through members 3 and 5. Member areas kept same to keep mass stable. Minor y adjustment of node_4 within 3.3-3.6 range could optimize stress balance. Avoid lowering node_4 y as it increased max stress before.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: member_4 length ~ sqrt((2.0)^2 + y^2). Increasing y increases length and mass slightly but may reduce stress. Check mass impact and max stress tradeoff.",
  
  "calculation": "Current member_4 length ~ sqrt(2^2 + 3.4^2) = sqrt(4 + 11.56) = sqrt(15.56) ~ 3.945. Slight increase to y=3.5: length ~ sqrt(4 + 12.25) = sqrt(16.25) ~ 4.03. Mass increase minimal. Stress expected to reduce by better load path. Other members lengths stable. Total mass expected ~19.9 max, under 30 limit.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Plan: Move node_4 from (2.0, 3.4) to (2.0, 3.5), keep all members and areas same. Expect max stress to reduce slightly below 6.99 and mass increase negligible. Continue optimization as stress still above zero and room for improvement.",
