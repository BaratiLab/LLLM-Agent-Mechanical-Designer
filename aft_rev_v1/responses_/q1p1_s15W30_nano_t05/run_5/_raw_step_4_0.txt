Member_4 has low stress (3.27) but high mass (7.08). Node_4 moved from (2.5,3.5) to (2.3,3.3) decreased mass and stress slightly. Load and support nodes fixed. Members 1 and 4 have area_id \'3\' (1.759), members 2,3,5 have \'2\' (0.782). Member_4 is relatively heavy; reducing its area or shortening length may help. Node_4 can be moved slightly to rebalance forces and reduce stress on member_3 and member_4. Member_3 stress is compressive and near max, so shortening member_3 or increasing its area may reduce stress. Member_4 is under tension with moderate stress; reducing length or area may reduce mass but may increase stress elsewhere.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try moving node_4 slightly closer to node_3 to reduce member_3 length; adjust member_4 length by slight reposition of node_4; consider reducing member_4 area from 3 to 2 if stress permits; keep member_3 area at 2 or increase to 3 if needed; member_5 area at 2 is fine; member_1 area at 3 is fine.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 closer to node_3 reduces member_3 length, reducing compressive stress. Slight vertical lowering reduces member_4 length and mass. Increasing member_3 area from 2 to 3 reduces stress. Decreasing member_4 area from 3 to 2 reduces mass with acceptable stress increase. Member_1 area remains at 3 for stiffness. Member_2 and member_5 area remain at 2. Node_3 fixed at (2.0,0.0) as load node; node_1 and node_2 fixed.
