  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 vertical position and member areas to reduce max stress and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 12.49 < 15 allowed, total mass 18.16 < 30 allowed. Node_4 moved down from 4.0 to 3.5 reduced stress but member_1 stress still high. Member_4 area increased to 3 to reduce stress but mass still moderate. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed.",
  
  "analysis": "Max compressive stress in member_1 (-12.49) is close to limit. Member_1 length fixed (node_1 to node_3). Node_3 fixed. Node_4 vertical position affects geometry and stress distribution. Reducing node_4 height further may reduce stress in member_1 by changing force paths. Member_4 area increased from 2 to 3 reduced stress. Member_3 and member_5 areas at 2 are moderate. Member_1 area at 2 may be increased to reduce stress further. Total mass is well below limit, so increasing area of critical members is possible. Member_4 area can be optimized down from 3 to 2 if stress permits. A slight lowering of node_4 to ~3.2-3.3 can balance forces better, possibly reducing stress in member_1 and allow smaller areas in members 3 and 4. Member areas to be chosen from discrete set. Aim to keep member_1 area at 3 or 4 to reduce stress below 10. Member_4 area can be 2 or 3. Member_3 and 5 area at 2 or 1 to reduce mass. Node_4 x fixed at 2.0 due to symmetry and no instruction to move horizontally. Supports and load nodes fixed.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Potential node_4 y: 3.2-3.3. Member_1 area: 3 or 4. Member_4 area: 2 or 3. Member_3 and 5 area: 1 or 2. Member_2 area: 2 (current) sufficient. Check mass and stress with these adjustments.",
  
  "reasoning": "Lowering node_4 from 3.5 to ~3.25 reduces lever arm and bending moment on member_1, reducing compressive stress. Increasing member_1 area reduces stress by increasing cross section. Member_4 area can be reduced if stress is low after node move. Member_3 and 5 area can be reduced to save mass if stresses are low. Member_2 area remains 2 as stress is low. Overall, this balances stress and mass within constraints.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: member_1 (node_1-node_3): 2.0 units, member_4 (node_4-node_3): approx sqrt((2-2)^2 + (3.25-0)^2) = 3.25 units. Member_3 (node_1-node_4): sqrt((2-0)^2 + (3.25-0)^2) = sqrt(4 + 10.56) = sqrt(14.56) ~3.815. Member_5 (node_4-node_2): sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-3.25)^2) = sqrt(16 + 10.56) = sqrt(26.56) ~5.154. Member_2 (node_3-node_2): 4.0 units. Mass = sum(length * area_factor). Check mass with chosen areas.",
  
  "calculation": "Choose areas: member_1 area_id=4 (3.128), member_2 area_id=2 (0.782), member_3 area_id=1 (0.195), member_4 area_id=2 (0.782), member_5 area_id=1 (0.195). Calculate mass: member_1: 2.0*3.128=6.256, member_2:4.0*0.782=3.128, member_3:3.815*0.195=0.744, member_4:3.25*0.782=2.54, member_5:5.154*0.195=1.005. Total mass=6.256+3.128+0.744+2.54+1.005=13.673 < 30. Stress expected reduced due to higher area in critical member_1 and lower node_4 height. Max stress expected < 12.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 y=3.25 (lower than current 3.5), node_4 x=2.0 fixed. Member areas adjusted to reduce stress and mass. Mass well below limit, stress reduced by increased area in critical member and geometry change. Supports and load nodes fixed. No duplicate nodes or members.",
