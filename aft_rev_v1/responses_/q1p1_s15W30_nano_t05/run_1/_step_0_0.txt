  "preamble": "Optimize a closed 2D truss with 3 given nodes, load, and supports, minimizing stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes: node_1(0,0,pinned), node_2(6,0,roller), node_3(2,0,loaded with -10N at -45deg). Max stress ±15, max mass 30. Areas discrete from 0 to 10. Need closed truss (all nodes connected forming at least one loop).",

  "analysis": "Nodes lie on x-axis at 0,2,6m. Load at node_3 is downward-left diagonal. Supports at ends. To create a closed truss, add at least one more node above to form a triangle or polygon. Triangular truss is statically determinate and efficient for stress distribution. Adding node_4 above node_3 to form two triangles: node_1-node_4-node_3 and node_3-node_4-node_2. This creates a closed polygon with 4 nodes and 5 members. Choose node_4 y-coordinate to balance load and minimize member length. Keep node_4 x close to node_3 (2m) to reduce member length and mass.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Choose node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) to form isosceles triangles with base on x-axis. Members: (1-3), (3-2), (1-4), (4-3), (4-2). Calculate member lengths, assign areas to keep stress ≤15 and mass ≤30. Assume uniform material density and linear elastic behavior. Use static equilibrium for forces. Approximate axial forces by resolving load and reactions. Select areas from given set to minimize mass.",

  "reasoning": "1. Closed truss requires at least one loop: adding node_4 creates two triangles sharing node_3. 2. Member lengths: shorter members reduce mass. 3. Stress = Force / Area; force estimated from static equilibrium. 4. Mass = sum(lengths × area). 5. Supports reactions calculated from equilibrium. 6. Areas chosen from given discrete values to satisfy stress and mass constraints. 7. Load at node_3 is -10N at -45°, decomposed into Fx = -7.07N, Fy = -7.07N. 8. Reactions at supports to balance load. 9. Members carry axial forces; tension or compression determined by geometry and load.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: (1-3)=2m, (3-2)=4m, (1-4)=3m, (4-3)=3m, (4-2)=4m. Total length sum=16m. Assume initial area 2 (0.782) for all members. Mass approx = 16*0.782=12.512 < 30 OK. Calculate axial forces using method of joints or sections. At node_3: equilibrium Fx and Fy including load and member forces. From equilibrium, estimate max force magnitude ~10N. Stress = force/area ≤15 => area ≥ force/15. With force ~10N, area ≥10/15=0.6667. Area 2 (0.782) suffices. Check mass again and adjust areas if needed to reduce mass while respecting stress.",
