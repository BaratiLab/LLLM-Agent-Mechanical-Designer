Node_4 vertical position affects geometry and stress distribution. Reducing node_4 height further may reduce stress in member_1 by changing force paths. Member_4 area increased from 2 to 3 reduced stress. Member_3 and member_5 areas at 2 are moderate. Member_1 area at 2 may be increased to reduce stress further. Total mass is well below limit, so increasing area of critical members is possible. Member_4 area can be optimized down from 3 to 2 if stress permits. A slight lowering of node_4 to ~3.2-3.3 can balance forces better, possibly reducing stress in member_1 and allow smaller areas in members 3 and 4. Member areas to be chosen from discrete set. Aim to keep member_1 area at 3 or 4 to reduce stress below 10. Member_4 area can be 2 or 3. Member_3 and 5 area at 2 or 1 to reduce mass.

Increasing member_1 area reduces stress by increasing cross section. Member_4 area can be reduced if stress is low after node move. Member_3 and 5 area can be reduced to save mass if stresses are low. Member_2 area remains 2 as stress is low.
