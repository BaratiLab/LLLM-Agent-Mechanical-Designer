  "preamble": "Current truss satisfies constraints with low max stress and near max mass limit.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 4.37 well below 15 limit; total mass 28.08 close to 30 max; nodes fixed at supports and load; node_5 added to reduce stress.",
  "analysis": "Stress is well distributed, max stress 4.37 is low; mass 28.08 is near max allowable; node_5 addition improved stress distribution; no stress exceeds limits; node positions comply with constraints; no duplicate members; areas chosen are valid.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further stress reduction likely minimal; mass is near max limit; moving node_5 might reduce stress marginally but risk mass increase; current design is stable and efficient.",
  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 created a triangular substructure reducing stress; members with higher stress have moderate area sizes; further shifting node_5 or changing areas risks increasing mass or stress; load and supports fixed; current design balances stress and mass optimally.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member stresses mostly between Â±4.4; areas range from 2 to 4; total mass 28.08 < 30; max stress 4.37 < 15; no constraints violated; no duplicate nodes or members; node_3 and node_5 positions critical for load path.",
  "calculation": "No changes to node_1, node_2, node_3 due to load/support; node_4 and node_5 positions optimal at (2.0, 3.25) and (4.0, 2.0); member areas retained as per current design; total mass and max stress verified; constraints satisfied.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Design meets all constraints; max stress low; mass near max but acceptable; no further improvement without violating mass or stress constraints; stop optimization.",
