Member_5 also high at 19.2. Mass is acceptable. Node_4 height reduced from previous 3.5 to 3.25 but stress worsened. Member areas vary but member_3 area is very small (area_id=1 = 0.195), causing high stress. Current topology is a simple triangular truss with 5 members. To reduce stress, need better load path and possibly add nodes for better force distribution. Node_3 at (2,0) is load node; node_4 at (2,3.25) is top node. Members from node_4 to node_2 and node_3 are small area (1), causing high stress. Member_1 (node_1-node_3) has large area (4=3.128) but low stress. Suggest adding an intermediate node above node_3 to create a more triangular load path and increase areas on highly stressed members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_3 stress too high due to small area and load concentration. Adding node between node_3 and node_4 to better distribute forces. Increase area of member_3 and members connected to node_4. Keep existing load/support nodes fixed. Avoid increasing mass beyond 30.
