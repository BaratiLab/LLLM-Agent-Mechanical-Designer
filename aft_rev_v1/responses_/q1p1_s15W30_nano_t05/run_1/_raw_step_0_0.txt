Max stress ±15, max mass 30. Areas discrete from 0 to 10. Need closed truss (all nodes connected forming at least one loop).",\n\n  "analysis": "Nodes lie on x-axis at 0,2,6m. Load at node_3 is downward-left diagonal. Supports at ends. To create a closed truss, add at least one more node above to form a triangle or polygon. Triangular truss is statically determinate and efficient for stress distribution. Adding node_4 above node_3 to form two triangles: node_1-node_4-node_3 and node_3-node_4-node_2. This creates a closed polygon with 4 nodes and 5 members. Choose node_4 y-coordinate to balance load and minimize member length. Keep node_4 x close to node_3 (2m) to reduce member length and mass.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Choose node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) to form isosceles triangles with base on x-axis.

Use static equilibrium for forces. Approximate axial forces by resolving load and reactions. Select areas from given set to minimize mass.",\n\n  "reasoning": "1. Closed truss requires at least one loop: adding node_4 creates two triangles sharing node_3. 2. Member lengths: shorter members reduce mass. 3. Stress = Force / Area; force estimated from static equilibrium. 4. Mass = sum(lengths × area). 5. Supports reactions calculated from equilibrium. 6. Areas chosen from given discrete values to satisfy stress and mass constraints. 7. Load at node_3 is -10N at -45°, decomposed into Fx = -7.07N, Fy = -7.07N. 8. Reactions at supports to balance load. 9.

At node_3: equilibrium Fx and Fy including load and member forces. From equilibrium, estimate max force magnitude ~10N. Stress = force/area ≤15 => area ≥ force/15.
