Load at node_3, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Node_3 and supports fixed. Node_4 moved from y=3 to y=4 improved stress and mass but mass increased. Areas vary from 2 to 4.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has good stress margin but mass close to limit. Member_4 (node_4-node_3) has largest area 4 (3.128) and mass 12.5, contributing heavily to total mass. Reducing area here can reduce mass and stress. Node_4 moved up to 4 increased mass but decreased max stress. Possibly lowering node_4 slightly and reducing member_4 area can optimize further. Members connected to node_4 mostly area 2 or 4. Member_1 area 3 (1.759) can be reconsidered. Member_3 (node_1-node_4) area 2 (0.782) is moderate. Node_3 fixed at (2,0) due to load. Supports fixed. Node_4 can move vertically between 3 and 4.5 to balance forces. Member lengths and angles affect stress distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider lowering node_4 from 4.0 to ~3.5 to reduce member_4 length and area, decrease mass. Adjust member_1 area down from 3 to 2 to reduce mass. Member_4 area from 4 to 3 or 2 to reduce mass and stress. Member_5 area remains 2. Member_2 area 2 is minimal for load transfer. Check if stress limits still hold after area reduction and node movement.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Lowering node_4 reduces length of member_4 and member_3, reducing mass and stress in these members. Reducing member_4 area from 4 to 2 or 3 reduces mass and stress capacity, but must keep stress within limits. Member_1 area can be reduced without exceeding stress limits seen previously. Member_5 area kept at 2 as stress moderate. Member_2 area minimal already. With node_4 at ~3.5, member lengths shorter, so stresses reduce. Total mass should drop below 27, giving margin. This balances stress minimization and mass constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4: from (2.0,4.0) to (2.0,3.5). Member areas: member_1: 2, member_2: 2, member_3: 2, member_4: 3, member_5: 2. Lengths: member_4 length ~ sqrt((2-2)^2 + (3.5-0)^2)=3.5, mass member_4=3.5 * 3.128(area 3) ~10.9, less than 12.5 before. Member_3 length ~3.5, mass ~3.5*0.782=2.74 less than before. Member_1 length ~2.0, mass 2*0.782=1.56 less than before. Total mass estimated ~ 1.56+3.128+2.74+10.9+4.423=22.75 approx. Stress expected to be less than 6.7 max due to shorter lengths and reduced areas.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Adjust node_4 y=3.5, reduce member_1 area to \'2\', member_4 area to \'3\', keep others at \'2\'.
