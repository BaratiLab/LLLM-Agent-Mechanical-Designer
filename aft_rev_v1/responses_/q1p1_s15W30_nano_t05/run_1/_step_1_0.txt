  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 13.06 < 15, total mass 13.77 < 30; load at node_3; supports fixed. Need to reduce max stress further.",
  
  "analysis": "Max compressive stress is on member_1 (-13.06). Members 2 and 4 have moderate stress. Node_3 is load point; node_1 and node_2 fixed supports. Node_3 can move horizontally only if allowed, but instruction forbids moving load/support nodes. Node_4 is free to move, currently at (2,3). Members connect node_4 to nodes 1, 2, 3 forming a triangle above baseline. Stress reduction likely by repositioning node_4 to better distribute forces and adjusting member areas to reduce stress concentration.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Move node_4 vertically and horizontally within limits to optimize force distribution. Possibly raise node_4 to increase triangle height for better load transfer. Adjust areas: reduce area for low-stress members, increase for high-stress members to keep stress within limits. Check mass after area adjustments.",
  
  "reasoning": "Increasing height of node_4 increases member lengths to nodes 1 and 2, potentially reducing stress in member_1 and member_2 by better force distribution. Member_4 connects node_4 and node_3 and carries significant compressive stress, so increasing area there helps. Member_1 has highest compressive stress, increase area. Members with low stress can have reduced area to save mass. Keep node_3 fixed at (2,0). Node_4 can be moved within reason to (2,4).",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: l_1 between node_1(0,0) and node_3(2,0) = 2.0, l_4 between node_4(2,y) and node_3(2,0) = y, l_3 between node_1(0,0) and node_4(2,y) = sqrt(4 + y^2). Increasing y from 3 to 4 increases l_3 and l_4, redistributing stress. Areas chosen from given set to keep mass < 30.",
  
  "calculation": "Set node_4 at (2,4). Member areas: member_1 area_id '3' (1.759), member_2 area_id '2' (0.782), member_3 area_id '2' (0.782), member_4 area_id '4' (3.128), member_5 area_id '2' (0.782). Approximate member lengths: member_1=2.0, member_2=4.0, member_3= sqrt(4+16)=4.472, member_4=4.0, member_5= sqrt((6-2)^2 + 4^2)= sqrt(16+16)=5.656. Mass approx = sum(length*area): 2*1.759=3.518 + 4*0.782=3.128 + 4.472*0.782=3.5 + 4*3.128=12.512 + 5.656*0.782=4.426 total ~27.18 < 30. Stress expected to reduce due to increased cross-section and better geometry.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved up to 4. Increased areas on high stress members to reduce stress. Mass within limit. Load/support nodes fixed. Structure remains closed. Expect max stress < 13.06 and within Â±15 constraint.",
