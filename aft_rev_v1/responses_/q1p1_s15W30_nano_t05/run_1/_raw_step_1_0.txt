Need to reduce max stress further.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max compressive stress is on member_1 (-13.06). Members 2 and 4 have moderate stress. Node_3 is load point; node_1 and node_2 fixed supports. Node_3 can move horizontally only if allowed, but instruction forbids moving load/support nodes. Node_4 is free to move, currently at (2,3). Members connect node_4 to nodes 1, 2, 3 forming a triangle above baseline. Stress reduction likely by repositioning node_4 to better distribute forces and adjusting member areas to reduce stress concentration.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Move node_4 vertically and horizontally within limits to optimize force distribution. Possibly raise node_4 to increase triangle height for better load transfer. Adjust areas: reduce area for low-stress members, increase for high-stress members to keep stress within limits. Check mass after area adjustments.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing height of node_4 increases member lengths to nodes 1 and 2, potentially reducing stress in member_1 and member_2 by better force distribution. Member_4 connects node_4 and node_3 and carries significant compressive stress, so increasing area there helps. Member_1 has highest compressive stress, increase area. Members with low stress can have reduced area to save mass. Keep node_3 fixed at (2,0). Node_4 can be moved within reason to (2,4).",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: l_1 between node_1(0,0) and node_3(2,0) = 2.0, l_4 between node_4(2,y) and node_3(2,0) = y, l_3 between node_1(0,0) and node_4(2,y) = sqrt(4 + y^2).
