Load at node_3 fixed at (2.0, 0.0). Members have uniform area \'2\' (0.782). Stress distribution is moderate, no member near limits. Potential to reduce stress by adjusting node_3 position or varying areas, but mass is already low and stress well below limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress is balanced; largest compressive stresses are on member_5 and member_4 (~-9.54, -9.04). Tensile max ~7.24. Node_3 at (2,0) central to bottom chord. Small shifts in node_3 vertically may redistribute stress but risk increasing mass or violating constraints.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "To reduce max stress further, node_3 could be moved slightly upward along y-axis to better distribute load from node_3 (-10N at -45°). However, node_3 is constrained not to move load/support nodes, so no movement allowed. Areas could be optimized by reducing area of low-stress members to reduce mass or increasing area on high-stress members to reduce stress. However, all members currently use area \'2\' (0.782), moderate size. Current mass is well below limit, so increasing areas to reduce stress is not necessary. The current design is balanced and minimal in mass with stress comfortably below limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member areas: all 0.782; mass sum 18.46 < 30; max stress 9.54 < 15; no violations. Node_3 fixed at (2,0). No duplicate nodes or members. Structure is closed and stable with pinned and roller supports.",\n  \n  "calculation": "No changes to node positions possible for load/support nodes. Node_3 fixed. No member area changes needed since stress < limit and mass < limit.
