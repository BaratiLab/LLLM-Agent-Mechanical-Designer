    "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to meet stress ±15 and mass ≤30 under given loads and supports.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 (-10N, -45°), supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Current max stress 37.38 > 15, mass 26.996 < 30. Need stress reduction primarily.",
    
    "analysis": "Current design has a high stress (-37.38) in member_7 (node_3-node_4) with smallest area (1). Members with zero or near-zero stress suggest inefficient layout. Load at node_3 causes bending and tension in members connected to node_4 and node_5. Node_5 at (2,4) adds complexity but member_3 has zero stress, indicating possible redundancy. Member areas vary between 1 and 3. Mass is under limit but stress exceeds allowable. Need to redistribute forces, increase cross-section in critical members, and possibly remove redundant members.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_5 to simplify structure, relocate node_4 slightly to optimize load path. Increase area in critical members. Ensure members form stable triangles from supports to load. Use area IDs 3 or 4 for high-stress members, reduce area in low-stress members. Check member lengths and stress after changes.",
    
    "proposal": "Remove node_5 and members connected to it. Keep nodes 1,2,3,4. Adjust node_4 to (3.0, 3.5) to better distribute load. Members: node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4. Assign areas to reduce stress: larger areas for members under tension/compression near load. Use area 4 (3.128) or 5 (4.887) for critical members. Aim to keep total mass under 30.",
    
    "reasoning": "Removing node_5 reduces complexity and eliminates zero-stress members. Moving node_4 slightly lower reduces member length and bending moment. Using triangular members from supports to load node_3 improves load path and reduces stress concentration. Increasing member cross-sections in critical members reduces stress. The selected node positions maintain support and load constraints. Member areas are selected to balance mass and strength.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths, assign areas, estimate mass = sum(length × area). Check max stress with increased area. Member length approx: node_1-node_3 ~2m, node_2-node_3 ~4m, node_3-node_4 ~3.2016m, node_1-node_4 ~4.0311m, node_2-node_4 ~3.2016m. Assign areas: members near load node_3 and node_4 get area 4 or 5, others area 2 or 3. Calculate total mass and verify <30 and max stress ≤15.",
