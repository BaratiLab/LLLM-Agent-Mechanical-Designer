Load and supports fixed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Stress is well below allowable limits. Mass is close to but below max allowed. Members mostly sized with area 3 (1.759) except member_5 with area 2 (0.782). Node_4 moved slightly to 3.5 height to reduce stress. No nodes at load/support moved. All members connected to form closed truss. No overstressed members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further reducing stress would require heavier members or different geometry, increasing mass or complexity. Current max stress is low, so no urgent need to increase member areas. Moving node_4 further up or down may increase stress or mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Given max stress is much less than allowable, and mass is under limit, the design is efficient. Increasing member areas would increase mass unnecessarily. Decreasing member areas risks violating stress constraints. Geometry is simple and stable with pinned and roller supports at base nodes. Load applied at node_3 is handled well.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas produce mass below 30. Stress checks show no violations. Node_4 position at y=3.5 balances member forces well. No duplicate nodes or members. Areas chosen from allowed set. No changes to load/support nodes as per instructions.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Mass = sum(length * area) = 28.67 < 30. Max stress = 6.32 < 15. Members with area_id \'3\' (1.759) and \'2\' (0.782) provide good balance. Node_4 at (3.0, 3.5) optimal for load transfer.
