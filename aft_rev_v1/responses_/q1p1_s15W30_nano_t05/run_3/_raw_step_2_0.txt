Constraints: max stress ±15, max mass 30. Current design exceeds both stress (max 105.97) and mass (33.7).",\n\n  "analysis": "Current structure has excessive stress mainly in member_9 (node_4-node_5) and member_4, member_6. Mass is above limit due to large cross-section areas and member lengths. Node_5 added in iteration 1 increased complexity and mass but did not reduce stresses adequately. Members connecting node_5 have high stress and mass. Load is applied at node_3 on bottom chord, which is not directly supported. Triangular truss topology with proper diagonals can better distribute stresses. Existing supports and load nodes fixed, so redesign internal nodes and members is needed.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_5 to reduce mass and complexity. Adjust node_4 position upward for better load transfer. Use a triangular truss with members from supports to node_3 and node_4. Use smaller cross-section areas for less stressed members and larger for critical tension/compression members. Avoid members with extremely high stress by adding diagonals or changing topology.",\n\n  "proposal": "Remove node_5. Keep nodes 1,2,3 fixed. Move node_4 to (3.0, 3.5) for better geometry. Members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_4. Assign areas to keep stresses within ±15 and mass below 30. Use area 3 (1.759) or 2 (0.782) for diagonals, area 1 (0.195) for chords, area 4 (3.128) for critical members.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Removing node_5 reduces mass and complexity. Moving node_4 upward increases truss height, reducing member forces. Adding member node_2-node_3 provides direct load path. Triangular shape is statically determinate and efficient. Cross-section areas chosen based on member force estimation and constraint limits. Lower areas for less stressed members to reduce mass. This simpler topology should reduce max stresses and mass.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_1-node_4 ≈ 3.905, node_2-node_4 ≈ 3.2016, node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_2-node_3 = 4.0, node_3-node_4 ≈ 3.2016. Estimate forces with load -10N at node_3 at -45°. Assign areas: node_1-node_4 (3), node_2-node_4 (2), node_1-node_3 (1), node_2-node_3 (1), node_3-node_4 (3). Calculate mass = sum(length*area_density). Area densities from input: \'1\':0.195, \'2\':0.782, \'3\':1.759. Mass estimate ~ (3.905*1.759)+(3.2016*0.782)+(2*0.195)+(4*0.195)+(3.2016*1.759) ≈ 6.87+2.50+0.39+0.78+5.63=16.17 < 30.

With truss height increased, member forces reduce, so max stress < 15 likely. Areas chosen to balance stress and mass.
