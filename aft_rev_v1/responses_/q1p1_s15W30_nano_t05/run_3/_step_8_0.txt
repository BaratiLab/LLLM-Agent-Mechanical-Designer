  "preamble": "Optimize truss to reduce max stress, keep mass under 30 and stress within Â±15.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 12.66 < 15, mass 24.49 < 30; load at node_3, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_5 moved up to 5.0 from 4.0 previously.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_3 (node_3-node_4) stress zero, indicating possible inefficiency. Members 6 and 7 (node_1-node_5, node_2-node_5) have moderate tensile stresses. Member_1 (node_1-node_3) is max compressive. Node_4 and node_5 positions can be optimized to better distribute forces and reduce peak stress. Member areas currently mostly at 2 or 3, can consider reducing area in low stress members to reduce mass.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on adjusting node_4 and node_5 positions to reduce stress in member_1 and member_5. Consider reducing area of member_3 from 3 to 2 or 1 to save mass since stress is zero. Possibly raise node_5 slightly to improve geometry and reduce stress in members 6 and 7.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_3 is zero stress, so reducing its area lowers mass without stress penalty. Node_5 is at (3,5), raising it slightly may reduce tensile stress in members 6 and 7. Node_4 at (3,3.5) controls geometry of members 3,4,5; slight horizontal or vertical adjustments can redistribute forces. Member_1 has highest compressive stress; shortening or changing angle may reduce stress. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed, so node_3 position fixed. Areas selected from given set; lowering area where stress is low saves mass. Total mass currently 24.5, can increase area in critical members slightly if needed while keeping mass <30.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member areas: currently member_3 area=3 (1.759), member_4 area=1 (0.195), others mostly 2 (0.782). Member length * area = member_mass. Max stress 12.66 < 15. Mass margin ~5.5. Adjust node_4 from (3,3.5) to (3.2,3.3) reduces member_1 length and compressive stress. Raise node_5 from (3,5) to (3,5.2) to reduce tensile stress in members 6 and 7. Reduce member_3 area from 3 to 1 to save mass. Recalculate member lengths and mass.",
