Load at node_3, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current max stress is from member_1 (-12.56) and member_5 (-9.17). Members with highest stress connect node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_5. Node_3 fixed at (2,0), node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_4 and node_5 can be moved to reduce stress concentrations. Member areas are mostly area_id \'2\' (0.782) or \'1\' (0.195). Mass is well below max. Stress in members_3 and _4 negligible, so node_4 and node_5 positions can be adjusted to redistribute forces.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider raising node_4 slightly and shifting node_5 slightly right and down to reduce tension in member_6 and compression in member_1. Keep closed truss shape intact. Avoid large member length increase to keep mass low.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 from (3.1, 2.9) to slightly higher y (around 3.3) may reduce bending stress on node_3 connections. Moving node_5 from (2.8,4.8) slightly right and down (around (3.1,4.5)) can reduce tension in members connected to it (member_6 and member_7). Maintain triangular closed truss shape with members: node_3-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_3-node_5, node_1-node_5, node_2-node_5. Use same area assignments to keep mass low. Areas can remain as is because max stress is within limits. Focus on geometry optimization.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and stresses roughly proportional to node positions. Small vertical and horizontal adjustments of node_4 and node_5 expected to reduce max stress from -12.56 to below 12.0. Mass should remain ~18.3. No new members or nodes added. Members and areas unchanged.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Adjust node_4 from (3.1, 2.9) to (3.1, 3.3). Adjust node_5 from (2.8, 4.8) to (3.1, 4.5). Keep all other nodes fixed.
