Current max stress 31.8 > 15, mass 9.3 < 30. Need to reduce max stress by better load path and member sizing.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high tensile stress (31.8) in member_3 (node_1-node_4) and compressive stress (-14.2) in member_1. Members connecting node_4 are undersized (area 1) causing stress concentration. Load at node_3 is not well supported by node_4 members. The geometry is simple with node_4 at (3,3.5) and node_3 at (2,0).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, increase cross-sectional area in critical members and improve triangulation. Possibly add a new node above node_4 to better distribute load from node_3. Keep nodes 1,2,3 fixed as per instruction. Avoid mass increase over 30.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 above node_4 at (3.0, 5.0) to create a stiffer upper triangle. Connect node_5 to node_4, node_3, node_1, and node_2. Increase areas of members carrying high stress to area 3 (1.759) or 4 (3.128). Use smaller area (1 or 2) for less stressed members. Remove direct member node_1-node_4 to reduce stress concentration. This creates a truss with better load path and reduces max stress below 15.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 above node_4 creates a double triangle, improving load distribution. Removing node_1-node_4 member reduces high tensile stress. Increasing member areas in main load paths reduces stress. Keeping mass under 30 by selective area assignment. Load at node_3 is transferred via members to node_4 and node_5, then to supports.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check lengths: node_4-node_5 ~1.5, node_3-node_5 ~5.39, node_1-node_5 ~5.39, node_2-node_5 ~3.16.
