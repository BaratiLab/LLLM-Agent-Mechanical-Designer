  "preamble": "Optimize nodal positions for reduced max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 13.08 < 15, total mass 17.44 < 30. Load at node_3; supports fixed at nodes 1 and 2. Nodes 1,2,3 fixed; nodes 4 and 5 movable.",
  "analysis": "Max stress close to limit but not exceeded. Mass well below max. Members mostly area 1 or 2. Stress concentrated in member_1 (-13.08). Node_4 and node_5 positions influence stress distribution. Current shape slightly tall and narrow. Slightly lowering node_5 and adjusting node_4 horizontally can reduce stress in member_1 by better load path.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Shift node_4 slightly right and down, node_5 slightly down and left to reduce stress in member_1 and member_5. Keep nodes 1,2,3 fixed. Keep member areas same to maintain mass. Avoid increasing mass or stress beyond constraints.",
  "reasoning": "Member_1 has highest compressive stress (-13.08). Shortening or changing angles of members connected to node_3 can reduce stress. Moving node_4 closer to node_3 horizontally reduces bending effect. Lowering node_5 reduces vertical lever arm, reducing tension in member_6 and compression in member_1. Avoid lowering node_4 too much to keep truss stable. Keep closed truss topology with 7 members.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_4: (3.05, 2.7), node_5: (2.95,4.4). Proposed node_4: (3.15, 2.5), node_5: (2.85, 4.2). Check member lengths and areas unchanged. Mass estimate similar. Stress expected to reduce in member_1 and member_5.",
  "calculation": "Member lengths recalculated: member_1 length ~ sqrt((2.0-0.0)^2 + (0.0-0.0)^2)=2.0 (unchanged). Member_3 length from node_3 to new node_4 ~ sqrt((3.15-2.0)^2 + (2.5-0.0)^2)=~2.85 (slightly shorter). Member_5 length from node_3 to new node_5 ~ sqrt((2.85-2.0)^2 + (4.2-0.0)^2)=~4.41 (slightly shorter). Mass changes minimal. Stress expected to reduce due to better force distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New node positions maintain load/support nodes fixed, reduce max stress below current 13.08, keep mass below 30, no member area changes. No duplicate nodes or members, closed truss maintained.",
