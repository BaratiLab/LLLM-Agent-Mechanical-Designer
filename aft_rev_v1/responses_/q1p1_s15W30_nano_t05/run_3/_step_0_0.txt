  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss with fixed nodes and supports, minimize stress, limit mass ≤30, max stress ±15.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given 3 nodes with two supports and one load at node_3. Need a closed truss (all nodes connected forming at least one closed loop). Constraints on max stress ±15 and mass ≤30. Areas from given discrete set. Fixed node positions for supports and load. Must add members and possibly nodes to form closed truss and optimize stress and mass.",
  
  "analysis": "Nodes: node_1(0,0, pinned), node_2(6,0, roller), node_3(2,0, load -10N at -45°). Current nodes lie on x-axis, no vertical members yet. To form a closed truss, at least one triangle or polygon is needed. Adding a new node above the line to form a triangular truss is optimal for stability and stress distribution. The triangle will be node_1, node_2, and new node_4 above x-axis near node_3 to reduce member length and stress. Members: edges of triangle plus diagonal members if needed. Areas chosen to keep stress within ±15 and mass ≤30. Use static equilibrium and approximate axial forces. Assume linear elastic, axial forces only, neglect bending. Calculate member lengths, axial forces from equilibrium, then stress = force/area. Use area from given discrete set to keep stress ≤15. Mass = sum(length × area).",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Plan: Add node_4 at (2.5, 3.0) above node_3 to form triangle (node_1, node_2, node_4). Members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_1-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3 if needed for stiffness. Check if node_3 connected directly or via node_4. Since node_3 is on x-axis and loaded, connect node_3 to node_4 and node_1 for load path. Avoid redundant members. Approximate forces using equilibrium equations. Use simplest area possible to keep stress ≤15 and mass ≤30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Closed truss requires at least 3 nodes forming a polygon. Existing nodes are colinear, so add node_4 above to form a triangle for stability. Load at node_3 is off center, so connecting node_3 to node_4 and node_1 provides load path. Members node_1-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4 form triangle base. Members node_3-node_4 and node_3-node_1 connect loaded node to structure. Area selection: larger area reduces stress but increases mass. Start with moderate area, adjust if stress exceeds limits. Use force equilibrium to find axial forces, then stress = force/area. Mass = sum(length × area). Verify mass ≤30 and stress ≤15.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic, axial forces only, static equilibrium, no bending. Load at node_3 = 10N at -45°. Calculate member lengths by Euclidean distance. Calculate axial forces by resolving load into components and equilibrium of forces at nodes. Use tension positive, compression negative. Areas chosen from given set. Stress = force/area. Mass = sum(length × area). Iterate area selection to meet constraints.",
