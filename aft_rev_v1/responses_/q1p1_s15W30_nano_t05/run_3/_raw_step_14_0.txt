Max stress ~13.13, total mass ~17.0. Load and support nodes fixed. Areas mostly at 2 and 1, balancing mass and strength.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress member_1 at -13.13 is close to limit but acceptable. Mass well below max 30. Members with near-zero stress can have minimal areas. Node_4 and node_5 moved slightly in last iterations to reduce stress. Further repositioning risks increasing stress or mass. Current member areas are balanced for load paths.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "No members exceed stress limits. Mass is efficient. Load at node_3 downward-left, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Geometry forms a stable closed truss. Minor node adjustments in previous steps improved stress distribution.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Further node movement likely yields marginal improvements with risk of violating constraints. Member areas are chosen from available set, mostly mid-range to balance mass and strength. Stress distribution is acceptable and no member is highly over-stressed. Closed truss connectivity maintained. Optimization has converged.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member stresses checked against ±15 limit. Mass sum calculated from length × area factors. Load and support nodes unchanged. Node_4 and node_5 positions refined in last iterations. No duplicate nodes or members.
