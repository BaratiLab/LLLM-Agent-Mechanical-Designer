Members mostly area 1 or 2. Stress concentrated in member_1 (-13.08). Node_4 and node_5 positions influence stress distribution. Current shape slightly tall and narrow.

Shortening or changing angles of members connected to node_3 can reduce stress. Moving node_4 closer to node_3 horizontally reduces bending effect.
