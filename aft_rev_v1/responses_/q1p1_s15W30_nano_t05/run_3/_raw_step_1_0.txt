Other members within limits. Mass is low, so can increase area or add members to reduce stress. Current geometry has node_4 at (2.5,3.0) close to node_3 (2,0). Load at node_3 downward-left. Members connected to node_3 limited. Redesign needed to better distribute load and reduce stress in member_2.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_4 higher or adding node(s) to create stronger triangulation. Possibly remove member_5 or adjust its area. Use larger areas in high-stress members, smaller in low-stress. Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Add one node above node_3 for better load path.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 above node_3 at (2.0, 4.0). Connect node_5 to node_1, node_2, node_3, and node_4. Remove member_5 (node_1-node_3) to reduce redundancy and stress concentration. Adjust member areas: high stress members get higher area IDs, low stress smaller. Use area IDs from set {0:1,1:0.195,2:0.782,...}.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 creates additional load path and triangulation, reducing stress in member_2. Removing member_5 reduces stress concentration near node_3. Increasing area of member_2 and members connected to node_5 balances stresses. Keep total mass under 30 by limiting large areas and member lengths. Triangular patterns improve stability and reduce bending.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_5 at (2.0,4.0) gives vertical member length 4.0, diagonal members ~4.47 (to node_1), ~4.47 (to node_2), ~1.0 (to node_4).
