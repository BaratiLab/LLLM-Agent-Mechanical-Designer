Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Areas mostly low to mid. Members 3 and 4 have near zero stress, indicating possible inefficient geometry.",\n  "analysis": "Members 3 and 4 (node_3-node_4 and node_4-node_5) have negligible stress, suggesting node_4 and node_5 positions may be suboptimal. Max stress is on member_1 (-12.52), member_5 (-9.21), and member_6 (6.96). Adjusting node_4 and node_5 positions can redistribute forces to reduce peak stress. Member areas are reasonable; no need to change areas now. Node_3, node_1, node_2 fixed due to load/support constraints. Node_4 and node_5 can move within reasonable bounds to improve force distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_4 slightly downward and closer to node_3 to increase stress in member_3 for better load sharing. Move node_5 slightly left and downward to balance forces in members 6 and 7. Keep the truss closed and stable. Avoid increasing member lengths excessively to control mass.",\n  "reasoning": "Increasing stress in currently near-zero stress members will help reduce load on highly stressed members. Moving node_4 closer to node_3 will increase axial forces in members 3 and 5, distributing load better. Slightly lowering node_5 will reduce bending moment and stress in member_6. Maintaining the closed truss shape ensures structural stability. Areas are well chosen; no need to increase them which would increase mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4 current: (3.2, 3.3), node_5 current: (3.0, 5.2). Try node_4 to (3.1, 2.9), node_5 to (2.8, 4.8). Expect member_3 and member_4 stresses to increase, member_1 and member_5 stresses to reduce. Mass remains similar as member lengths change slightly. Areas unchanged.",\n  "calculation": "New node positions: node_4: (3.1, 2.9), node_5: (2.8, 4.8). Members connections unchanged. Areas unchanged. Estimated member length changes minor, mass ~19.3.
