Load applied at node_3. Supports fixed. Node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_4 and node_5 movable. Members mostly area_id=2 or 1. Stress concentrated in member_1 (-13.2).",\n  "analysis": "Member_1 experiences highest compressive stress (-13.2). The truss is stable and within mass limits. Node_4 and node_5 can be adjusted to better distribute forces and reduce stress in member_1. Member_3 and member_4 have near zero stress, indicating potential for geometry refinement. Member_5 and members connected to node_5 have moderate stress. Using area_id=2 mostly is reasonable for balance of mass and strength.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Moving node_4 slightly downward and node_5 slightly left and upward may reduce compressive force on member_1 by changing force paths. Smaller vertical distance between node_4 and node_5 may balance force distribution. Avoid large changes to keep structure stable and mass low.",\n  "reasoning": "Member_1 compressive stress is high likely due to geometry causing large axial load. By lowering node_4 from 3.3 to about 2.9 and shifting node_5 slightly left from 3.1 to about 2.9 and raising y slightly to about 4.7, the force in member_1 can be reduced. This moves load path closer to center, reducing lever arm and axial force in member_1. Member areas remain mostly area_id=2 except members 3 and 4 with area_id=1 for low stress. This keeps mass well below 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_4: (3.1,3.3), node_5: (3.1,4.5). Proposed node_4: (3.1,2.9), node_5: (2.9,4.7).

Max stress expected to reduce below 13.",\n  "calculation": "Member_1 length reduced by ~0.5m, stress ~13.2 to ~11.5. Member_3 and member_4 lengths increase slightly but stress near zero.
