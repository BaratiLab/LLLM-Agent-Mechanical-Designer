Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Current max stress 37.7 > 15. Mass 9.9 < 30. Need stress reduction mainly in members 3 and 5. Areas limited to discrete values. Node_4 at (3,3.5) creates high stress in members 3 and 5.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has excessive tensile stress in member_3 (31.8) and compressive in member_5 (-37.7). Members 1 and 2 have acceptable stress. Mass is low, so room to increase areas or add members. Node_4 position creates long slender members causing high stress. No additional nodes except node_5 can be added for structural improvement. Load is at node_3, which is on bottom chord between supports - weak point. A triangular truss with a higher node above node_3 can better distribute forces.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, add node_5 above node_3 at ~ (2,4) to form a more balanced truss. Connect node_5 to nodes 1,2,3,4 to create multiple load paths. Increase areas of highly stressed members. Use area 3 or 4 for tension members, 2 or 3 for compression. Remove low area members with high stress, or increase their area. Keep mass under 30.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (2.0, 4.0).

Increasing areas to 2 or 3 reduces stress below limit. Using area 3 for node_3-node_5 member handles tension. Area 1 for node_4-node_5 keeps mass low.
