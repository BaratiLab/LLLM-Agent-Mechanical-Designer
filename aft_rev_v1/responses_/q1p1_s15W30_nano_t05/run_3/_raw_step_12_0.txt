Load at node_3, supports fixed. Areas mostly at 1 or 2. Node_4 and node_5 positions can be adjusted to improve stress distribution.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_1 (-12.76), member_5 (-9.21) and member_6 (7.08). Member_1 is critical. Member areas are moderate (1 or 2). Node_3, node_1, node_2 fixed. Node_4 and node_5 can be moved. Current node_4 at (3.1,2.9), node_5 at (2.9,4.7). The structure is a closed truss formed by these nodes and members. Stress can be reduced by improving geometry to better align members with load paths and reduce bending effects.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_4 slightly lower and node_5 slightly more centered vertically to reduce tensile/compressive peaks. Member areas can remain the same as they are balanced. Avoid increasing mass significantly.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 downward closer to node_3 horizontally can reduce bending in members connected to node_4 and node_5. Slightly shifting node_5 horizontally towards midpoint between node_1 and node_2 can balance load paths from node_3. This reduces stress concentration in member_1 and member_5. Maintaining areas at \'1\' and \'2\' keeps mass low. No need to add members as current connectivity is sufficient. Avoid changing load/support nodes. The current mass is well below max mass. Stress margin is moderate, so small geometry adjustments are appropriate.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4: from (3.1,2.9) to approx (3.05, 2.7). Node_5: from (2.9,4.7) to approx (2.95,4.4). Keep all other nodes fixed. Member areas unchanged. Check length changes and estimate stress reduction by better alignment with load vector (-10N at node_3 at -45deg).",\n  \n  "calculation": "New node positions: node_4 = (3.05, 2.7), node_5 = (2.95, 4.4). This reduces vertical height of node_4, slightly reduces member_3 length, improving stiffness. Node_5 lowered and centered reduces eccentric load effects on members 6 and 7. Member lengths recalc: member_1 ~ length from (0,0) to (2,0) unchanged. Member_3 length reduces from ~1.58 to ~1.32. Member_5 length from node_3 to node_5 reduces slightly. Mass approx same as areas unchanged. Expected max stress reduced by ~5-10% due to better force distribution. Total mass remains ~18.1. Constraints remain satisfied.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes or members. Areas remain in allowed set. Load and support nodes fixed. Structure remains closed.
