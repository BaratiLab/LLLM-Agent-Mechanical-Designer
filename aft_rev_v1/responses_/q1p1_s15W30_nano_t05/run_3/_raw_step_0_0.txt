Need a closed truss (all nodes connected forming at least one closed loop). Constraints on max stress ±15 and mass ≤30. Areas from given discrete set. Fixed node positions for supports and load. Must add members and possibly nodes to form closed truss and optimize stress and mass.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Nodes: node_1(0,0, pinned), node_2(6,0, roller), node_3(2,0, load -10N at -45°). Current nodes lie on x-axis, no vertical members yet. To form a closed truss, at least one triangle or polygon is needed. Adding a new node above the line to form a triangular truss is optimal for stability and stress distribution. The triangle will be node_1, node_2, and new node_4 above x-axis near node_3 to reduce member length and stress. Members: edges of triangle plus diagonal members if needed. Areas chosen to keep stress within ±15 and mass ≤30. Use static equilibrium and approximate axial forces. Assume linear elastic, axial forces only, neglect bending. Calculate member lengths, axial forces from equilibrium, then stress = force/area. Use area from given discrete set to keep stress ≤15. Mass = sum(length × area).",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Plan: Add node_4 at (2.5, 3.0) above node_3 to form triangle (node_1, node_2, node_4). Members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_1-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3 if needed for stiffness. Check if node_3 connected directly or via node_4. Since node_3 is on x-axis and loaded, connect node_3 to node_4 and node_1 for load path. Avoid redundant members. Approximate forces using equilibrium equations. Use simplest area possible to keep stress ≤15 and mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Closed truss requires at least 3 nodes forming a polygon. Existing nodes are colinear, so add node_4 above to form a triangle for stability. Load at node_3 is off center, so connecting node_3 to node_4 and node_1 provides load path. Members node_1-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4 form triangle base. Members node_3-node_4 and node_3-node_1 connect loaded node to structure. Area selection: larger area reduces stress but increases mass. Start with moderate area, adjust if stress exceeds limits. Use force equilibrium to find axial forces, then stress = force/area.
