Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Current mass 35.8 > 30, stresses OK. Need mass reduction.",\n  "analysis": "Current design has 5 nodes, members with areas mostly 2 or 3, total mass 35.78 exceeds 30. Max stress well below 15, so stress constraint is met. Mass reduction needed by lowering member areas or removing redundant members. Node_5 at (2,4) adds complexity and mass. Members from node_1 and node_2 to node_5 have large areas (3) and length, increasing mass. Structure can be simplified by removing node_5 and associated members, and optimizing areas of remaining members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Removing node_5 reduces members and mass. Keep nodes 1,2,3,4. Use triangular truss with members: (1-3), (2-3), (1-4), (2-4), (3-4). Assign areas to balance stress and mass. Use smaller areas for short members and larger for longer or high-stress members. Calculate lengths and estimate mass. Check stress distribution feasibility.",\n  "proposal": "Remove node_5 and members connected to it. Use nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(3,3.5). Members: member_1(1-3), member_2(2-3), member_3(1-4), member_4(2-4), member_5(3-4). Assign areas: member_1=2 (0.782), member_2=2 (0.782), member_3=1 (0.195), member_4=1 (0.195), member_5=2 (0.782). This reduces mass and keeps stress manageable.",\n  "reasoning": "Removing node_5 cuts heavy members and reduces total length and mass. Areas chosen to keep stresses under limit: larger area for bottom chords (members 1,2,5) which carry more load, smaller area for diagonal members (3,4) to reduce mass. Node_3 is load point, so members connected to it must be sized carefully. This 4-node truss is simpler and lighter, expected mass < 30 and max stress < 15.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: 1-3=2m, 2-3=4m, 1-4=sqrt(3^2+3.5^2)=4.6098m, 2-4=sqrt(3^2+3.5^2)=4.6098m, 3-4=sqrt(1^2+3.5^2)=3.6401m.
