Constraints: max stress ±15, max mass 30. Current iteration 2 mass 19.3, max stress ~57 (exceeds limit). Need to reduce stress, especially compressive on member_3 (-57).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high compressive stress on member_3 (node_1-node_3). Members connecting load node_3 to supports are insufficiently sized or positioned. Member areas 1 and 2 are small; member_3 area=1, length short, so stress high. Node_4 at (3,3.5) helps but not enough. Member_5 (node_3-node_4) also under stress. Total mass is within limit but stress fails. Need to better triangulate load node_3 to supports with stiffer members and possibly add a node to better distribute forces.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a new node above node_3 to create two triangles can reduce stress. Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Add node_5 at (2.0, 4.0) (above node_3). Connect node_5 to node_1, node_2, node_3, and node_4. Increase cross sections on critical members. Use larger areas for members carrying high load. Avoid overly large areas to keep mass <30.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (2.0, 4.0). Members: node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_5, node_2-node_5, node_3-node_5, node_4-node_5. Assign areas to reduce stress: larger areas (3 or 4) for members from supports to node_5 and node_4, moderate areas for node_3 connections. This triangulation improves force path and reduces stress in members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangulated geometry with node_5 above node_3 creates stable load path. Larger areas on members from supports to node_5 and node_4 reduce stress by increasing section modulus. Members connecting node_3 to node_5 and supports sized moderately to carry load without excessive mass. This distributes load more evenly and reduces high compressive stress on node_1-node_3 member.
