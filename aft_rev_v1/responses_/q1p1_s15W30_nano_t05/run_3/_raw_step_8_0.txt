Members 6 and 7 (node_1-node_5, node_2-node_5) have moderate tensile stresses. Member_1 (node_1-node_3) is max compressive. Node_4 and node_5 positions can be optimized to better distribute forces and reduce peak stress.

Node_5 is at (3,5), raising it slightly may reduce tensile stress in members 6 and 7. Node_4 at (3,3.5) controls geometry of members 3,4,5; slight horizontal or vertical adjustments can redistribute forces. Member_1 has highest compressive stress; shortening or changing angle may reduce stress. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed, so node_3 position fixed.
