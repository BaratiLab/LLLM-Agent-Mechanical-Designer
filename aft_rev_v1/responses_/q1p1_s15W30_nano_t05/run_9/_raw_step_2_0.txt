Current max stress 35.75 MPa and mass 60.5 exceed limits. Load at node_3 downward-left. Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Existing nodes fixed for load/support. Need lighter members and reduce stress concentration.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current design has large mass and excessive tensile stress (-35.75 MPa) on member_2 (node_1-node_3). High mass mainly from large area members (area_id 3 and 4) on long diagonals to node_5. Members to node_5 are heavy and induce stress concentration. Node_5 is far vertically, increasing member length and mass. Members connecting node_1 and node_2 directly have small area but still contribute to mass. Load at node_3 induces tension in member_2 and compression in member_1 and others. Current topology is complex with many long members to node_5 increasing mass and stress.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce mass and stress, remove node_5 and its members. Keep node_4 for vertical support but reposition it for better force distribution. Use smaller area members where possible. Simplify truss to triangular shape with nodes 1, 2, 3, 4 to reduce complexity and mass. Optimize area distribution to keep stresses within ±15 MPa. Recalculate member lengths and select area from given discrete set. Aim for direct load path from node_3 to supports.",\n\n  "proposal": "Remove node_5 and its members. Keep nodes 1, 2, 3, 4. Position node_4 at (2.0, 2.5) to reduce member lengths and mass. Connect members: node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_2. Assign areas: small areas (1 or 2) for shorter members, moderate (3) for diagonal members to node_4. This reduces mass and stress concentration.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Removing node_5 eliminates long, heavy members with large areas causing excess mass and stress. Shortening node_4 height reduces member lengths and mass. Triangular topology efficiently distributes load from node_3 to supports. Smaller area members reduce mass, while moderate area on diagonal members ensures stress limits are met. Load at node_3 (-10, -45°) induces tension in node_1-node_3 and compression in node_2-node_3, so areas chosen to balance stresses within ±15 MPa.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approx: node_1-node_2 = 6.0, node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_2-node_3 = 4.0, node_1-node_4 = sqrt(2^2 + 2.5^2) ≈ 3.2016, node_2-node_4 = sqrt(4^2 + 2.5^2) ≈ 4.71699, node_3-node_4 = 2.5. Assign areas: node_1-node_2 area 1 (0.195), node_1-node_3 area 2 (0.782), node_2-node_3 area 2 (0.782), node_1-node_4 area 3 (1.759), node_2-node_4 area 3 (1.759), node_3-node_4 area 2 (0.782). Calculate total mass = sum(length * area). Approx mass: (6*0.195)+(2*0.782)+(4*0.782)+(3.2016*1.759)+(4.71699*1.759)+(2.5*0.782) ≈ 1.17 + 1.56 + 3.128 + 5.63 + 8.29 + 1.955 = 21.7 < 30.
