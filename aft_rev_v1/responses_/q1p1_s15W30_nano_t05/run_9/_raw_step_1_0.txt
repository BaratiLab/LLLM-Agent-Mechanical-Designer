Members with area 1 or 2 cause high stress. Member_5 (node_1-node_4) is critical. The truss shape is a triangle with a vertical node_4. Load is on node_3 on bottom chord, causing high stress in diagonal members. Mass is acceptable but stress is not. Need to reduce stress by changing topology or increasing cross-section in critical members or adding members to redistribute load.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing area on overstressed members increases mass but current mass budget allows it. Adding members to form a more stable truss (e.g. a Warren or Pratt truss shape) can reduce stress. Node_4 can be moved or added nodes introduced to improve load path. Avoid large areas on all members to keep mass low. Use areas from given discrete set.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node (node_5) above node_3 to form a more triangular load path. Connect node_5 to node_1, node_2, and node_4. Adjust areas: increase area on critical diagonals to area \'3\' or \'4\' (1.759 or 3.128), reduce area on bottom chord members to \'1\' or \'0\'. Keep node_3 fixed. This creates a more stable truss with better load distribution and lower stress in members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 at (2.0, 4.5) above node_4 (2.0,3.0) forms two triangles sharing node_4 and node_5, distributing load from node_3 through node_4 and node_5 to supports. This reduces stress in member_5 and member_6. Increasing areas on diagonal members carrying high tension/compression reduces stress below 15. Bottom chord members can have smaller areas to reduce mass. Total mass estimated under 30 with these changes.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_1-node_2 = 6m, node_1-node_3=2m, node_2-node_3=4m, node_3-node_4=3m, node_4-node_5=1.5m, node_1-node_4=~3.605m, node_2-node_4=~4.472m, node_1-node_5=~4.716m, node_2-node_5=~4.716m, node_3-node_5=4.5m.
