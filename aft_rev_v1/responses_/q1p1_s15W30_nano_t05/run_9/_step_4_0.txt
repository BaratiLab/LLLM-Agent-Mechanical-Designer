  "preamble": "Current structure meets constraints with minimized stress and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 12.64 < 15, mass 21.14 < 30, load and supports fixed, nodes optimized previously.",
  "analysis": "Stress is well below limit, mass is under max. Node_4 lowered slightly from 2.5 to 2.3 reduced mass and balanced stresses. Members use areas balancing mass and strength. No excessive stress concentrations.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further moving node_4 risks increasing stress or mass. Current member areas and connections are minimal for closed truss. Load and supports fixed, so node_3 and nodes 1,2 fixed.",
  "reasoning": "To reduce stress, node_4 was lowered closer to base to reduce member lengths and stress in member_2. Member areas reflect moderate sizing to keep stress under limit. No redundant members added to avoid mass increase. Constraints fully met.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member areas: 1 (0.195), 2 (0.782), 3 (1.759) chosen to balance mass and stress. Node_4 moved down to reduce lever arm and stress in diagonal members. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed.",
  "calculation": "Member lengths and areas yield total mass 21.14 < 30 and max stress 12.64 < 15. Stress distribution balanced across members. Node_4 at y=2.3 minimizes max stress. No new nodes or members added to keep structure minimal.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met, no further improvement without violating constraints or increasing mass. Optimization converged.",
