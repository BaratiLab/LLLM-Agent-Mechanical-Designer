Further small downward move may reduce stress more.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress occurs in member_2 (-12.3) and member_6 (-9.04), both connected to node_3 and node_4. Members from node_1 and node_2 to node_4 have tensile stresses ~3.4 and 2.5. Moving node_4 closer to line between node_1 and node_2 (lower y) may reduce bending and stress in diagonal members. Current mass distribution is reasonable. Area selections seem well balanced.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try lowering node_4 y coordinate slightly from 2.5 to ~2.3 to reduce compressive stress in member_2 and member_6 while maintaining triangular geometry.
