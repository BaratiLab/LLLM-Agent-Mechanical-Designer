  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 12.3 < 15, mass 21.75 < 30. Load at node_3 fixed at (2,0). Supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. Node_4 moved down from 3.0 to 2.5 improved stress. Further small downward move may reduce stress more.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress occurs in member_2 (-12.3) and member_6 (-9.04), both connected to node_3 and node_4. Members from node_1 and node_2 to node_4 have tensile stresses ~3.4 and 2.5. Moving node_4 closer to line between node_1 and node_2 (lower y) may reduce bending and stress in diagonal members. Current mass distribution is reasonable. Area selections seem well balanced.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try lowering node_4 y coordinate slightly from 2.5 to ~2.3 to reduce compressive stress in member_2 and member_6 while maintaining triangular geometry. Keep x=2 fixed to maintain symmetry and load/support constraints. Monitor stress changes and mass impact.",
  
  "reasoning": "Node_4 position affects internal force distribution. Lowering node_4 reduces lever arm and bending moments induced by load at node_3. This can reduce max compressive stress in member_2 and member_6. Maintaining area sizes avoids mass increase. Avoid adding nodes or changing load/support nodes to comply with instructions.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_4: (2.0, 2.5). Try (2.0, 2.3). Member lengths reduce slightly for members connected to node_4, reducing mass marginally. Stress expected to decrease in highly stressed members. Areas remain: member_1:1, member_2:2, member_3:2, member_4:3, member_5:3, member_6:2.",
  
  "calculation": "Node_4 new position: (2.0, 2.3). Recalculate member lengths:\nmember_4: length sqrt((2-0)^2 + (2.3-0)^2) = sqrt(4 + 5.29) = sqrt(9.29) ≈ 3.048\nmember_5: length sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-2.3)^2) = sqrt(16 + 5.29) = sqrt(21.29) ≈ 4.613\nmember_6: length sqrt((2-2)^2 + (0-2.3)^2) = 2.3\nMass recalculated using area factors and lengths remains < 21.75.\nExpected max stress reduces below 12.3 due to shorter lever arm and member lengths.\nNo violation of stress or mass constraints expected.\nNo change in load/support nodes.\nNo duplicate nodes or members.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 lowered to 2.3 reduces max compressive stress, keeps mass under 30, maintains closed truss with 4 nodes, 6 members, and valid areas. Optimization can continue if stress still not minimal.",
