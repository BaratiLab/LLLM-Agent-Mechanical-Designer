  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under given load and supports with stress and mass constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 (-10N, -45°), pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Max stress ±15, max mass 30. Current max stress 60.4 >> too high. Mass 12.6 < 30 acceptable. Need to reduce stress by redesign or redistribute forces.",

  "analysis": "Current design has high compressive stress (-60.4) in member_1 (node_1-node_3). Members connected to node_3 bear most load. Node_3 is on bottom chord between supports. Node_4 above creates a triangular shape but stress concentration persists. Areas are moderate but member_1 area is 0.195, quite small, causing high stress. To reduce max stress, increase cross-sectional area or change geometry to improve force flow. Also consider adding a node to create a more efficient truss shape (e.g., a Warren or Pratt truss style).",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing area on member_1 alone may not suffice; stress might shift elsewhere. Adding a node above node_3 to form two triangles can distribute load better. Keep node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_3 can stay or be moved slightly if allowed, but instruction forbids changing load/support nodes. So add node_5 above node_3 at (2.0, 4.0). Connect node_5 to node_1, node_2, and node_3 to form a stable truss. Select larger areas for highly stressed members. Check total mass after area selection.",

  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (2.0, 4.0). Members: node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_5, node_1-node_5, node_2-node_5, node_4-node_5 (optional). Remove node_4 or keep it as stabilizer at (3.0,3.0) connected to node_5. Assign areas to keep stress ≤ ±15 and mass ≤30.",

  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 creates two triangles sharing load, reducing force on member_1. Members connecting node_5 to supports will carry load in tension/compression more efficiently. Use area codes: member_1 (node_1-node_3) area 2 (0.782), member_3 (node_3-node_5) area 3 (1.759), others area 2 or 3 as needed. Node_4 retained at (3.0,3.0) to stiffen structure but connected only to node_5 to avoid redundancy. This layout balances load paths and reduces peak stress.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_5 = 4.0, node_1-node_5 = sqrt((2-0)^2 + (4-0)^2)=4.472, node_2-node_3=4.0, node_2-node_5=sqrt((6-2)^2+(0-4)^2)=5.657, node_4-node_5=sqrt((3-2)^2+(3-4)^2)=1.414. Areas assigned to limit stress and mass. Total mass = sum(length × area). Check total mass <30.",

  "calculation": "Mass = 2.0*0.782 + 4.0*1.759 + 4.472*1.759 + 4.0*0.782 + 5.657*0.782 + 1.414*0.195 = 1.564 + 7.036 + 7.864 + 3.128 + 4.424 + 0.276 = 24.292 < 30 OK. Max stress expected <15 due to larger areas and improved geometry.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Structure with 5 nodes, 6 members, areas selected to reduce stress and mass within limits. Node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_3 at (2.0,0.0), node_4 at (3.0,3.0), node_5 at (2.0,4.0). Members connect supports, intermediate nodes, and top node to distribute forces efficiently.",
