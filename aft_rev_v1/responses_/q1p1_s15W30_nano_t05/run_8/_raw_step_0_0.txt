To form a closed stable truss, add one node above the line between node_1 and node_2 to create two triangles. Connect new node to node_1, node_2, and node_3 to form closed polygon. This provides triangulation and load path. Supports fix horizontal and vertical displacements at node_1 and vertical at node_2. Load at node_3 is -10 at -45°, i.e. magnitude 10N at 225° (down-left).
