Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_5 added to reduce stress from iteration 0. Member areas mostly 2 and 3, some 1.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Stress reduced significantly from iteration 0 to 1 by adding node_5 and adjusting members. Max stress at member_1 (-12.06) and mass distribution reasonable. Further node moves limited by fixed load/support nodes. Member_6 stress zero, possibly redundant.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_6 carries no load, can be removed or area reduced. Member_1 highest compressive stress. Reducing length or area of high-stress members may help but risk increasing stress elsewhere.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Given constraints and fixed load/support nodes, further node movement limited. Node_5 positioned to relieve stress in member_1. Member areas chosen to balance mass and stress. Removing member_6 reduces mass slightly but may reduce stability. Stress near limit 12 < 15, so no urgent need to increase area. Further optimization likely marginal.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member_1 length ~2, area 2 (0.782) mass ~1.56; stress -12.06.

Moving node_4 or node_5 slightly risks increasing stress. Member areas balanced for minimal mass and stress. Removing member_6 saves 0.276 mass but small. Stress margin adequate.
