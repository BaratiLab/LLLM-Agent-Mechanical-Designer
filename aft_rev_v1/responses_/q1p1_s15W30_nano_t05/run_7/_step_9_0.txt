  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 vertical position to reduce max stress while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress ~9.41 < 15, total mass ~22.39 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved upward slowly in past iterations, stress decreased but mass increased slightly.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is dominated by member_5 (node_3-node_4) in compression near -9.41, marginally below limit. Members with tensile stress (member_3) are ~7.78. Mass is acceptable but can be optimized by slight node repositioning. Node_3 fixed at x=2.0, y=0.0; node_1 and node_2 fixed at base. Node_4 moved from 3.6 to 3.8 in last step, stress slightly decreased. Increasing node_4 height may reduce compression in member_5 but increase tension in member_3 and mass. Decreasing node_4 height reduces tension but increases compression in member_5. Optimizing node_4 y between 3.75 to 3.85 likely to minimize max stress. Areas are well chosen; no change needed. Member_6 (node_1-node_2) area=1 minimal mass and stress. Member_1 and member_2 areas=3 (1.759) large enough for low stress. Members 3,4,5 area=2 (0.782) balance mass and strength. Strategy: fine tune node_4 y-position to minimize max stress.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try node_4 y=3.7 to 3.9 range; estimate stress impact. Use linear interpolation from previous results: at 3.6 max stress ~9.45, at 3.8 max stress ~9.41. Small improvement. Try 3.75 or 3.85 for better stress balance.",
  
  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 slightly upward reduces compression in member_5 by increasing length and changing angle, reducing stress magnitude. But too high increases tension in member_3. Balance needed. Given current trend, node_4 y=3.75 may reduce max stress slightly below 9.4. Keep x=3.1 fixed to maintain geometry and avoid large changes in member length. Keep areas unchanged to maintain mass and stress balance. No new members or nodes needed.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculations: member_5 length = sqrt((3.1-2)^2 + (y_4 - 0)^2). At y_4=3.8 length ~ sqrt(1.21 + 14.44)= sqrt(15.65)=3.96. At y_4=3.75 length ~ sqrt(1.21 + 14.06)=3.86 (shorter). Shorter member_5 length increases stress assuming same load. So slightly increasing y_4 reduces stress in member_5. At 3.85 length ~ sqrt(1.21 + 14.82)=3.99 (longer). Slightly longer member_5 reduces compression stress. But mass increases slightly. Optimal between 3.8 and 3.85. Choose y_4=3.83 for compromise.",
  
  "calculation": "Set node_4 to (3.1,3.83). Keep all members and areas as is. Expect max stress to reduce from 9.41 to ~9.3. Mass increase negligible (<0.1). Constraints met: max stress <15, mass <30. No load/support node moved. No duplicate nodes or members. Areas from allowed set. Design remains closed truss.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no violation of constraints, no new nodes or members, only node_4 y changed. Areas unchanged. Load/support nodes fixed. Stress expected reduced. Mass within limit. Stop optimization only if stress near minimum; here slight improvement possible, so continue.",
