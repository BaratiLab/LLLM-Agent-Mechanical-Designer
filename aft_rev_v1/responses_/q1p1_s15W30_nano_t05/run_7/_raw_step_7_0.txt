Node_4 at (3.25,3.4) controls geometry of top triangle. Moving node_4 slightly can balance force distribution and reduce stress peaks. Member_6 (bottom chord) has low stress (-2.62) and smallest area (1). Areas are moderate; no need to increase area which adds mass.

Avoid increasing member lengths excessively to keep mass low.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing height of node_4 increases vertical stiffness, reducing bending effects. Slight left shift balances horizontal force components. Avoid too high node_4 to prevent large member lengths and mass increase. Area assignments are efficient; no changes needed.
