Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Current max stress 39.18 exceeds ±15 limit. Mass 9.61 < 30 limit. Need to reduce stress by redesign.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure has excessive tensile/compressive stresses in members 3 and 5, likely due to insufficient triangulation and member sizing. Mass is low, so area can be increased selectively. Node_4 moved slightly up to 3.3 height but stress worsened. Members connecting node_3 to node_4 and node_1 to node_4 are overstressed. Need better load path and stress distribution.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding an additional node above node_4 to improve triangulation and reduce member length/stress. Increase cross-sectional areas of critical members. Keep supports and load nodes fixed. Possibly add diagonal members to create stiffer truss geometry.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Add node_5 above node_4 at (3.35, 5.0) to form a truss \'roof\'. Connect node_5 to node_1, node_2, node_4 and node_3. Adjust member areas to reduce stress below ±15. Keep existing nodes fixed except new node_5.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Adding a higher node creates additional load paths and reduces bending in lower members. Diagonal members from node_5 distribute forces better. Increasing area of members under high stress reduces stress. Member length and area combination controls mass. Ensure no duplicate members or nodes. Use areas from given set.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_5, node_2-node_5, node_4-node_5, node_3-node_5. Assign areas: critical members get area \'4\'(3.128) or \'5\'(4.887), others smaller. Check stresses roughly proportional to force/area. Verify total mass <30.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths (approx): node_1-node_5 ~5.83, node_2-node_5 ~5.83, node_4-node_5 ~1.7, node_3-node_5 ~5.0. Assign areas: members connected to node_5 as 3 or 4 to reduce stress. Existing members with high stress get area 4 or 5. Sum mass estimation within 30. Expect max stress <15 with improved geometry and increased areas.",\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no node moves for load/support nodes. No duplicate members. Areas selected from allowed set.
