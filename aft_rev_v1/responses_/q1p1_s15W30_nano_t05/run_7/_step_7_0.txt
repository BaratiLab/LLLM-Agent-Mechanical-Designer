  "preamble": "Optimize nodal position of free node_4 to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 9.63 < 15, total mass 21.65 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 movable. Members connect nodes in closed truss with areas mostly 2-3.",
  
  "analysis": "Max compressive stress is on member_5 (-9.63), tensile on member_3 (8.34). Both near mid-range but room to reduce. Node_4 at (3.25,3.4) controls geometry of top triangle. Moving node_4 slightly can balance force distribution and reduce stress peaks. Member_6 (bottom chord) has low stress (-2.62) and smallest area (1). Areas are moderate; no need to increase area which adds mass. Focus on geometry optimization.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Move node_4 slightly upward and left to reduce tensile stress in member_3 and compressive in member_5. Avoid increasing member lengths excessively to keep mass low.",
  
  "reasoning": "Increasing height of node_4 increases vertical stiffness, reducing bending effects. Slight left shift balances horizontal force components. Avoid too high node_4 to prevent large member lengths and mass increase. Area assignments are efficient; no changes needed. Member_6 added for bottom chord to stabilize base. Keep node_3 fixed due to load. Node_1 and node_2 fixed due to supports.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Try node_4 at (3.1, 3.6) from (3.25,3.4) to increase height by 0.2 and shift left by 0.15. Recalculate member lengths and estimate stress reduction. Expect member_3 and member_5 stresses to reduce by ~10-15%. Mass to remain below 25.",
  
  "calculation": "Member lengths: \n- member_3 (node_1 to node_4): sqrt((3.1-0)^2 + (3.6-0)^2) = ~4.76\n- member_5 (node_3 to node_4): sqrt((3.1-2)^2 + (3.6-0)^2) = ~3.82\nMass estimates with area_id 2 (0.782) and 3 (1.759) for members 1,2,3,4,5 remain similar. Slight increase in length offset by stress reduction.\nStress expected to reduce max stress to ~8.0\nTotal mass estimated ~22.0, within limit.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 position adjusted to (3.1, 3.6) to optimize stress distribution. Member connections unchanged. Areas unchanged. Constraints met. Further minor adjustments possible but diminishing returns expected.",
