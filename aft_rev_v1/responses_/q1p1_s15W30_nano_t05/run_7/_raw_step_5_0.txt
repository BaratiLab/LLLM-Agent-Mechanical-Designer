Existing nodes: node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4. Members connect these with varying areas. Max stress exceeded ±15 in members 3,4,5. Mass is low (4.88), so stress is main issue.",\n  "analysis": "Current design has high stresses in members connected to node_4 and node_3. Member_5 especially overstressed (-38.87). Areas are small (mostly area_id=1 or 2) but increasing areas increases mass. Mass is well below 30, so can increase areas or add members/nodes to reduce stress. Node_4 placement at (3.35,3.5) may cause high stress in diagonal members. Adding a node above node_4 can help redistribute forces. Member connectivity is minimal; adding members to triangulate and share load will reduce stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_5 above node_4 to form upper triangle. Connect node_5 to node_1, node_2, node_4, node_3. Increase areas on highly stressed members. Use area ids up to 4 (3.128) or 5 (4.887) for critical members. Keep member lengths short to reduce stress. Avoid over-sizing to keep mass under 30.",\n  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (3.35, 5.0). Members: connect node_5 to node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4. Increase area of members connected to node_3 and node_4 to area_id=3 or 4. Use areas to keep stresses within ±15. Remove or reduce area on less stressed members to save mass.",\n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 creates additional load path, reduces stress concentration. Increasing areas on members with high stress reduces stress by increasing cross-section. Keeping node_1, node_2 fixed as supports. Node_3 fixed due to load. Node_4 slightly adjusted to 3.5 height to maintain geometry. Member areas chosen from given set to balance mass and stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths, then estimate stress reduction by area increase. Member length examples: node_1-node_5 ≈ sqrt((3.35)^2 + (5)^2) ≈ 6.05. Mass = sum(length * area). Target total mass < 30. Stress inversely proportional to area. Increase area on members with stress >15 to reduce stress below limit.",\n  "calculation": "Members and areas: member_1(node_1-node_3): area 4 (3.128), length 2.0, mass 6.256; member_2(node_2-node_3): area 4 (3.128), length 4.0, mass 12.512; member_3(node_1-node_4): area 3 (1.759), length ~4.38, mass 7.7; member_4(node_2-node_4): area 3 (1.759), length ~3.76, mass 6.6; member_5(node_3-node_4): area 3 (1.759), length ~3.61, mass 6.35; member_6(node_1-node_5): area 3 (1.759), length ~6.05, mass 10.64; member_7(node_2-node_5): area 3 (1.759), length ~5.39, mass 9.48; member_8(node_4-node_5): area 2 (0.782), length 1.5, mass 1.17; member_9(node_3-node_5): area 2 (0.782), length ~5.12, mass 4.0. Total mass ~65.5 exceeds 30, so reduce areas on less critical members: reduce member_6,7 to area 2; member_8,9 to area 1; recalc mass ~41.5 still high. Further reduce member_1,2 to area 3; member_3,4,5 to area 2. Recalculate mass ~29.7 under 30. Stress expected below 15 due to increased areas and added node.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Final design includes 5 nodes, 9 members with carefully selected areas balancing mass and stress.
