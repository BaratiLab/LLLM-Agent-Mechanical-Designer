  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress ~9.41 <15, mass ~22.45 <30; load at node_3, supports fixed; only node_4 movable.",
  "analysis": "Max stress is from member_5 (-9.41), compressive. Member areas mostly 2 or 3. Slightly adjusting node_4 vertical position may reduce stress in member_5 and others. Horizontal position of node_4 fixed near 3.1 to maintain geometry. No new members or nodes added to keep structure closed and simple.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing node_4 y slightly may reduce compressive stress in member_5. Also consider reducing member_3 area from 2 to 1 to lower mass without increasing stress beyond limit.",
  "reasoning": "Member_5 is critical; reducing its compressive stress can improve design. Node_4 vertical position controls geometry of members 3,4,5. Balancing areas to reduce mass and stress. Member_6 area kept at 1 as it has low stress.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Try node_4 y from 3.83 to 3.9; keep x=3.1. Member_3 and 4 area 2; member_1 and 2 area 3; member_5 area 2; member_6 area 1. Evaluate stress trend with small y increase.",
  "calculation": "Node_4 moved from (3.1,3.83) to (3.1,3.9). Member areas unchanged. This small y increase should reduce compressive stress in member_5 by slightly lengthening it and improving force distribution. Mass increase minimal. Stress expected to reduce max stress from ~9.41 to ~9.0 or less, within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 y increment small enough to maintain structure shape and constraints. Member areas kept same to avoid stress increase. Structure remains closed with six members and four nodes. Load and supports unchanged.",
