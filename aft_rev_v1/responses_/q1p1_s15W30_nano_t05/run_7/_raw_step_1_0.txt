Current max stress slightly exceeds limit (-15.07 vs ±15). Mass is acceptable (18.87 < 30). Nodes fixed at supports and load. Current design has 4 nodes, 5 members with varying areas.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current max compressive stress is marginally over limit on member_1. Member_5 is very heavy (area 4, mass 9.89). Some members have low stress and may be downsized. Node_4 placement at (3,3) is good for triangulation but member areas can be optimized. Member_2 has low area (1) but moderate stress (-12). Member_3 and 4 have equal areas (2) but low stresses. Member_5 has largest area (4) but low stress (-2.38), indicating overdesign. Overall, reassigning member areas to better balance stresses and reduce mass is key. Possibly reduce area of member_5 and increase areas of highly stressed members slightly. Also consider moving node_4 slightly upward to improve force distribution.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce member_5 area from 4 to 2 or 3; increase member_1 area from 2 to 3 to reduce stress. Keep member_2 at area 1 or increase to 2. Slightly raise node_4 y from 3 to ~3.5 for better geometry. Check member lengths and recalc masses. Aim total mass < 20 and max stress ≤ 15.",\n\n  "proposal": "Keep nodes 1,2,3 fixed. Move node_4 to (3.0, 3.5). Adjust member areas: member_1:3, member_2:2, member_3:2, member_4:2, member_5:2.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Raising node_4 increases vertical component, reducing axial stress on member_1. Increasing member_1 area reduces stress below limit. Reducing member_5 area reduces mass significantly. Member_2 area increased slightly to handle moderate stress. Members 3 and 4 kept same as stresses are moderate. This balances stresses and mass within constraints.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: member_1 (node_1 to node_3): 2.0 m; member_2 (node_2 to node_3): 4.0 m; member_3 (node_1 to node_4): sqrt(3^2 + 3.5^2) ≈ 4.6098 m; member_4 (node_2 to node_4): sqrt(3^2 + 3.5^2) ≈ 3.2016 m; member_5 (node_3 to node_4): sqrt((3-2)^2 + (3.5-0)^2) = sqrt(1 + 12.25) = 3.6401 m. Mass = sum(length * area_factor). Using area factors: 3=1.759, 2=0.782, 1=0.195. Mass: m1=2*1.759=3.518, m2=4*0.782=3.128, m3=4.6098*0.782=3.605, m4=3.2016*0.782=2.503, m5=3.6401*0.782=2.847.
