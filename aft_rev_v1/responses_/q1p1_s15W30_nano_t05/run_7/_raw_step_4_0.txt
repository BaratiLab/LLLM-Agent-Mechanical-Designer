Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Existing nodes fixed for supports/loads. Constraints: max stress Â±15, max mass 30. Current design mass 66.7 (too high), max stress 3.57 (OK). Need lighter structure with lower area members and fewer heavy members.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current iteration 3 structure has excessive mass (66.7 > 30) due to large area members (area_id 3 and 4) and many members. Max stress is low, so we can reduce member areas. Node_5 added in iteration 3 increased mass substantially without stress benefits. Prior iterations with fewer nodes and members had lower mass but violated stress or stability constraints. Need to reduce member areas, remove node_5, and optimize node_4 position for load transfer.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_5 to reduce mass. Keep nodes_1,2,3,4. Use smaller areas (area_id 1 or 2). Adjust node_4 y-position slightly higher (~3.5) for better load path. Connect node_3 to node_4 and supports with minimal area members. Avoid large area members at supports. Aim total mass < 30. Check member lengths and areas for mass calculation.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Use nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(3.35,3.5). Members: member_1(node_1-node_3, area 2), member_2(node_2-node_3, area 1), member_3(node_1-node_4, area 1), member_4(node_2-node_4, area 1), member_5(node_3-node_4, area 1). Remove node_5 and associated members. This reduces mass and keeps stress within limits.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing node_5 cuts heavy members. Smaller areas reduce mass while stress remains safe due to low forces. Node_4 height at 3.5 balances load transfer. Using area_id 1 or 2 keeps mass low. Member lengths roughly: 2-3 ~2m, 1-4 ~4m, 2-4 ~3.6m, 3-4 ~3.1m. Mass approx sum(length*area) < 30. Stress expected below 15 based on previous results and smaller areas.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: 1-3: 2.0m, 2-3: 4.0m, 1-4: sqrt(3.35^2+3.5^2)=4.84m, 2-4: sqrt((6-3.35)^2+3.5^2)=4.08m, 3-4: sqrt((3.35-2)^2+3.5^2)=3.73m. Areas: member_1=0.782, others=0.195. Mass: (2*0.782)+(4*0.195)+(4.84*0.195)+(4.08*0.195)+(3.73*0.195)=1.564+0.78+0.944+0.796+0.727=4.81 approx.
