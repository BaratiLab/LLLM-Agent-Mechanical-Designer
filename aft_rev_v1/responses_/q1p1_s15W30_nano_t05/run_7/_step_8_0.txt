  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 9.45 < 15; mass 21.99 < 30. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_4 movable. Members mostly area 2 or 3, one area 1. Max stress member_5 at -9.45. Aim to reduce stress magnitude by adjusting node_4 position.",
  "analysis": "Node_4 moved from 3.4,3.25 to 3.1,3.6 improved max stress from 9.63 to 9.45. Stress in member_5 (node_3-node_4) is critical. Member_1 and member_2 have moderate compression. Member_3 tension ~8. Member_6 low stress. Mass is moderate. Increasing height of node_4 may reduce compression in member_5 by changing force distribution. But too high may increase member lengths and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Slightly increasing y of node_4 from 3.6 to ~3.8 might further reduce compressive stress in member_5 by increasing angle, reducing axial force magnitude. Keep x close to 3.1 to avoid increasing member_1 and member_2 length. Consider area adjustments if needed but current areas seem balanced. Member_6 area 1 is minimal, acceptable.",
  "reasoning": "By increasing node_4 y-coordinate, the angle between node_3-node_4 and horizontal increases, reducing axial compression in member_5. This can reduce max stress. Keep node_4 x-coordinate near 3.1 to maintain geometry. Member areas are well selected; no need to increase as mass limit is not reached. Node_3 fixed at (2,0), node_4 moved upward. This should keep structure stable and within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate new node_4 position (3.1, 3.8). Member lengths: node_3-node_4 length = sqrt((3.1-2)^2 + (3.8-0)^2) ~ sqrt(1.21 + 14.44) = sqrt(15.65) ~3.956. Slightly longer than before (~3.6). Check mass impact: member_5 length increases ~10%, mass increases similarly. Total mass ~24, still <30. Expected stress reduction in member_5 compression from -9.45 to ~-8.5 based on force distribution. Others remain similar.",
  "calculation": "Update node_4 to (3.1, 3.8). Members unchanged: member_1, member_2 area 3; member_3,4,5 area 2; member_6 area 1. Estimated mass increase ~2 units, total ~24 <30. Max stress expected to reduce to ~8.5. Member_5 compression reduced due to geometry. Member_3 tension slightly reduced. Member_1,2 compression stable. Member_6 minimal stress. Node_3 and supports unchanged. Structure remains closed truss.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved to (3.1,3.8). Members unchanged. Mass and max stress within constraints. Improvement over iteration 7. Stop optimization if next iteration shows marginal gains.",
