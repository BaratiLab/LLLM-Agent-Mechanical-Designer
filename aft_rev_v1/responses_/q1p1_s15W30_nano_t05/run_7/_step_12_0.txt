  "preamble": "Current truss design satisfies constraints with minimized max stress.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 9.38 < 15, mass 22.79 < 30, load and support nodes fixed, node_4 moved upward to reduce stress.",
  "analysis": "The current design has max stress well below allowable 15, total mass below 30. Load node_3 and support nodes fixed. Node_4 positioned to balance stress distribution. Member areas selected to balance mass and stress.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further node_4 movement offers diminishing returns. Member areas optimized to keep stress balanced. No new nodes or members added to maintain simplicity.",
  "reasoning": "Stress is minimized by adjusting node_4 vertical position to optimize force paths. Member areas chosen to keep mass low but sufficient strength. Member_5 is critical with max compressive stress near -9.38, well within limits. No constraint violations.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas produce mass 22.79 < 30. Max stress 9.38 < 15. Load at node_3 causes compression in member_5, tension in member_3. Node_4 at (3.1,4.0) balances forces well.",
  "calculation": "No further node movement improves max stress below current 9.38. Mass remains within limits. Member areas stable. No violations found.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Current design optimal given constraints and instructions. No duplicate nodes/members. Load/support nodes fixed. Node_4 position precise. Stop optimization.",
