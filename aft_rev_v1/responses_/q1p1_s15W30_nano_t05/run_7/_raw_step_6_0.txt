Current mass 31.14>30, stress ok. Need mass reduction and maintain stress ≤15.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure has 5 nodes, 9 members, mass slightly above limit. Members near load node_3 with large areas add mass. Stress distribution is within limits but member_9 stress near max compressive. Areas are mostly 1-3, some 1 area members low stress, some high mass members can be optimized. Node_5 at (3.35,5.0) high, causing long members. Possibly remove node_5 or reposition to reduce member lengths and mass. Members connecting node_5 increase mass significantly. Load is at node_3, so strengthening members around node_3 and supports is crucial.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_5 to reduce mass. Adjust node_4 height to better distribute forces. Use smaller areas on low stress members. Add diagonal bracing between node_1, node_2, node_4, and node_3 to improve stiffness and reduce member sizes. Keep node_3 at (2,0) for load application. Try node_4 at ~3.2-3.5 height. Use area ids 1 or 2 for low stress members, 3-4 for high stress members. Avoid long members with large areas.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Remove node_5.

Assign areas to minimize mass but keep stresses ≤15. Add bottom chord member node_1-node_2 to improve stability and reduce stress in other members.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Removing node_5 reduces long members and mass. Adding bottom chord node_1-node_2 improves load path and reduces bending. Adjusting node_4 height optimizes geometry for force distribution.

Assign areas: members near load (1-3) get area 3 (1.759), others area 1 (0.195) or 2 (0.782). Estimate mass = sum(length*area).
