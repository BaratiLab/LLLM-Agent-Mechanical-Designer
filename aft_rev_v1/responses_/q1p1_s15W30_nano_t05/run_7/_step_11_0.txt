  "preamble": "Optimize stress by adjusting node_4 vertical position within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress ~9.4 < 15, mass ~22.6 < 30. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed at node_1, node_2. Node_4 moved slightly up in last step, stress slightly decreased.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_5 (-9.395), compressive but well below ±15. Total mass is moderate. Member areas mostly 3 or 2, with bottom chord area 1. Node_4 can move vertically only. Increasing node_4 y may reduce stress in member_5 by changing angle and force distribution. Current design stable but slight stress reduction possible by fine tuning node_4 position.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_5 stress depends on length and angle between node_3 and node_4. Increasing node_4 y increases length and changes force angle, potentially reducing compressive stress. Member_3 and member_4 tensile stresses are moderate. Bottom chord member_6 stress moderate and area minimal.",
  
  "reasoning": "To minimize max stress, focus on reducing stress in member_5 (currently highest compressive). Increasing node_4 y slightly should reduce compressive stress magnitude in member_5 by increasing length and changing force angle. Keep member areas as is to maintain mass and structural integrity. Avoid increasing mass above 30. Node_3 fixed at (2,0), node_1 and node_2 fixed supports at (0,0) and (6,0). Node_4 can be moved vertically only. Increment node_4 y from 3.9 towards 4.1 in small steps to check stress reduction.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: member_5 length = sqrt((3.1-2)^2 + (y_4 - 0)^2). Increasing y_4 increases length, reducing stress for given force. Area of member_5 is 2 (0.782). Stress = Force / Area. Increasing length reduces force in member_5, reducing stress. Total mass = sum(length * area). Increasing length slightly increases mass but within limit. Max stress target < 9 to improve from current 9.395.",
  
  "calculation": "Try node_4 y = 4.0 (from 3.9). New length member_5 = sqrt(1.1^2 + 4.0^2) = sqrt(1.21 + 16) = sqrt(17.21) ≈ 4.15 (previous length ~4.0). Mass member_5 increases slightly, total mass ~22.7 still < 30. Expected stress reduction in member_5 due to longer member and changed force angle. Other member stresses expected to remain similar. Member areas unchanged to keep mass stable and stress distribution balanced.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Updated node_4 to (3.1,4.0). Members unchanged. Areas unchanged. Expect max stress reduction in member_5 below 9.4, total mass still < 30. Continue optimization next iteration if stress not sufficiently reduced.",
