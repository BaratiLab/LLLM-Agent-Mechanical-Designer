Triangle is simplest closed shape, good for stability and load transfer. Load at node_3 acts diagonally down-left, so placing a node above nodes 1-3 line can help resist this. Supports at ends fix horizontal and vertical displacements. Constraints: max stress ±15, max mass 30, area choices discrete. Need to minimize stress by efficient load path and choose minimal area members to keep mass low.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 above line between node_1 and node_2, around x=3, y=3. Connect node_4 to node_1, node_2, node_3 to form triangle with internal bracing. Members: (1-3), (2-3), (1-4), (2-4), (3-4). Check lengths, assign areas to keep stress and mass constraints. Use simplified static equilibrium and truss assumptions.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Closed truss with 4 nodes: nodes 1,2,3 on baseline, node_4 above. Members connect all nodes to form closed loops. Load at node_3 creates tension/compression in members. Assume axial forces only. Calculate member lengths and approximate forces by static equilibrium.
