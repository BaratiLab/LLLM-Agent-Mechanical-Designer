Need to reduce max stress further and possibly mass.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_5 (-9.4), tensile/compressive within limits. Member_1 has compressive stress -6.3, member_3 tensile 7.9. Areas for members 3-5 are 2, member_1 area 3, member_2 area 2. Member_1 area can be slightly reduced if stress allows. Node_4 is only free node to move. Moving node_4 slightly right and down could reduce stress in member_5 and member_3 by balancing forces better. Also, reducing area of member_1 from 3 to 2 or 1 might reduce mass without exceeding stress limits. Aim to keep closed truss shape intact.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try node_4 around x=3.3 to 3.5, y=3.2 to 3.4. Reduce member_1 area from 3 to 2 or 1. Check if stress stays <=15. Member_5 area can remain 2 or reduce to 1 if stress low enough. Member_3 area from 2 to 1 possible if stress allows. Member_2 and 4 remain at 2 for stability.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 slightly right reduces moment arm on member_5 under load at node_3, reducing stress magnitude. Lowering y slightly reduces tensile stress in member_3. Reducing member_1 area reduces mass but must keep stress within limits. Member_5 area reduction depends on stress after node move. Member_3 area reduction depends on stress after node move. Member_2 and 4 keep area 2 for support stability.
