  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress and maintain constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress is 29.05 close to limit 30, mass is well below 30. Node_4 is free to move vertically and horizontally except at load/support nodes.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_3 (node_1-node_4) at 29.05, near tensile limit. Members 1,2,5 have low stress. Mass is 11.65, well below 30. Load at node_3 fixed. Supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_4 position (2.0,3.0) can be optimized to reduce stress in member_3 and member_4 (node_2-node_4).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing height of node_4 may reduce tensile stress in member_3 and compressive in member_4. Also shifting node_4 slightly towards node_2 may balance forces better.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_3 is shortest with area 1 (0.195 area) but stressed near limit. Increasing area may increase mass unnecessarily. Better to adjust node_4 position to reduce stress. Moving node_4 lower and slightly right reduces member_3 length and changes force distribution, lowering peak stress. Keep node_4 x > 2.0 to avoid collinearity with node_1-node_3-node_2.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Try node_4 at (2.5, 2.5). Calculate approximate member lengths and expected stress reduction. Member_3 length reduces, member_4 length slightly reduces, which may reduce stress. Areas remain same.",
  
  "calculation": "New node_4: (2.5, 2.5). Member lengths: m3 ~ sqrt((2.5-0)^2 + (2.5-0)^2)=3.54 vs old 3.61, m4 ~ sqrt((6-2.5)^2 + (0-2.5)^2)=4.30 vs old 4.47. Slight reductions in length and improved angle distribution expected to reduce max stress below 29.05. Mass unchanged as areas unchanged.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved to (2.5, 2.5) to reduce stress in member_3 and member_4 while keeping structure closed and constraints met. No duplicate nodes or members. Areas unchanged. Load/support nodes fixed. Mass remains well below limit. Further iteration possible if stress still near limit.",
