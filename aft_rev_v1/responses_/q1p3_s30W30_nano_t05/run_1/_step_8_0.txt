  "preamble": "Optimize nodal position of free node_5 and member areas to minimize max stress under constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress ~13.07 < 30 limit, total mass 15.57 < 30 limit. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_5 moved closer to node_4 compared to previous iteration. Member areas mostly low-medium. Stress distribution uneven, member_1 compression highest. Objective is to reduce max stress further.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_1 has highest compressive stress (-13.07) and large area 2. Member_5 has notable compressive stress (-9.04) with area 2. Members 6 and 7 carry low tensile/compressive stress with small areas. Node_5 is close to node_4, which may increase stress in members connected to node_5. Current member areas for bottom chord (members 1 and 2) are medium (area 2). Top chord members 3,4,5 are also area 2. Members connected to node_5 have small areas 0 or 1. The structure is stable and within constraints but can reduce max stress by slight repositioning of node_5 and adjusting member areas to balance stress better.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_5 slightly upward and right to reduce stress concentration on member_1. Increase area of member_1 to 3 if needed, reduce area of less stressed members to compensate mass. Possibly increase area of member_5 to 3 to reduce its stress. Keep other members at area 2 or less. Ensure total mass <=30. Check stress impact after node move and area changes.",
  
  "reasoning": "Moving node_5 slightly away from node_4 reduces stress in member_8 and redistributes forces in members 6 and 7. Increasing area of high-stress members (member_1 and member_5) reduces stress by increasing capacity. Reducing area of low-stress members (member_6 or 7) compensates mass increase. Node_5 position must remain close to node_4 to maintain closed truss shape and equilibrium. Load and support nodes fixed, so only node_5 can be moved. Use precise float values for node_5 position. Areas selected from given discrete set.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: calculate from node positions. Mass = sum(length * area_factor). Area factors: {'0':1, '1':0.195, '2':0.782, '3':1.759}. Current total mass 15.57, can increase area for few members. Stress reduction estimated by increasing area. Node_5 current pos: (2.1, 3.05). Try (2.15, 3.1) or (2.2, 3.1). Adjust member_1 area from 2 to 3. Adjust member_5 area from 2 to 3. Reduce member_6 area from 1 to 0. Keep member_7 at 1 or reduce to 0 if possible. Check mass and stress after changes.",
  
  "calculation": "Node_5 moved to (2.15, 3.1). Member areas: member_1:3, member_2:2, member_3:2, member_4:2, member_5:3, member_6:0, member_7:1, member_8:0. Calculate member lengths: member_1 (node_1 to node_3): 2.0, member_5 (node_3 to node_4): length ~3.0, member_6 (node_1 to node_5): ~3.67 (area 0 reduces mass here), member_7 (node_2 to node_5): ~4.02. Mass ~ sum(length*area_factor): member_1:2.0*1.759=3.518, member_2:4.0*0.782=3.128, member_3:3.0*0.782=2.346, member_4:3.605*0.782=2.82, member_5:3.0*1.759=5.277, member_6:3.67*1=3.67*0.195=0 (area 0 means factor 1?), area '0' means 1, so mass 3.67*1=3.67, member_7:4.02*0.195=0.784, member_8:1.0*1=1.0 (length ~1, area 0 means 1?). Total mass ~3.518+3.128+2.346+2.82+5.277+3.67+0.784+1=22.543. Within 30 limit. Expected stress reduction in member_1 and member_5 due to increased area. Member_6 stress negligible, area 0 acceptable. Member_8 low stress, area 0 acceptable. Max stress expected < current 13.07.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_5 moved to (2.15, 3.1) to reduce stress concentration. Increased areas of critical members 1 and 5 to 3 to reduce stress. Reduced area of member_6 to 0 to compensate mass. Total mass within limit. Expected max stress reduced below 13. Current design stable and within constraints. Further node moves or area changes yield diminishing returns. Continue optimization next iteration or stop if no improvement.",
