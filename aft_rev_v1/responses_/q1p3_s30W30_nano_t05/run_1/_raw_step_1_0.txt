Constraints: max stress ±30, max mass 30. Current max stress 52.4 (exceeds), mass 8.48 (ok). Need to reduce stress primarily.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high compressive stress on member_1 (-52.4) and member_5 (-36.3), both exceed ±30 limit. Members 3 and 4 have low stresses. Member_1 and member_5 have small area (1 and 1) but still overstressed. Adding a node above node_3 to create additional load path can reduce stress concentration. Increasing cross-sectional areas on highly stressed members will reduce stress but increase mass. Need balance. Current layout is a simple triangular truss with one vertical node. Better load distribution can be achieved by adding a node vertically above node_3 to form two triangles, and adjusting areas accordingly.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_5 at (2.0, 4.0). Connect node_1-node_5, node_2-node_5, node_3-node_5. Remove member_5 to reduce direct high stress on node_3-node_4. Increase area on members carrying high load. Use area ids 2 or 3 for critical members. Keep member lengths short to reduce mass. Check stress and mass iteratively.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (2.0, 4.0). Members: member_1: node_1-node_3 area 2, member_2: node_3-node_2 area 2, member_3: node_1-node_4 area 1, member_4: node_2-node_4 area 1, member_5: node_1-node_5 area 3, member_6: node_2-node_5 area 3, member_7: node_3-node_5 area 3, member_8: node_4-node_5 area 1. This creates a stable truss with two triangles sharing node_5 at top, improving load paths and reducing stress peaks.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 above node_3 creates additional load paths, reducing stress on member_1 and member_5 in original design. Increasing area for members connected to node_5 will carry load better. Using area_id 3 (0.782) balances mass and strength. Members 3,4,8 keep small area as they have low stress.
