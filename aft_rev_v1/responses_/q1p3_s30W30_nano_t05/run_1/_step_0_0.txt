    "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss with 3 given nodes, minimize stress under load, keep structure closed and within stress and mass limits.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given 3 nodes: node_1(0,0) pinned, node_2(6,0) roller, node_3(2,0) loaded with -10N at -45°. Max stress ±30, max mass 30. Need closed truss (all nodes connected).",
    
    "analysis": "Nodes are colinear on x-axis; to form a closed truss, add a new node above x-axis to create triangular members. Load at node_3 is downward-left diagonal force. Supports at ends. Triangular shape offers good load transfer, minimizing bending and stress. Choose areas to balance mass and stress constraints.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 above node_3, e.g. at (2,3) to form triangle node_1-node_4-node_2 with node_3 connected inside. Connect members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3. This closes structure and distributes load.",
    
    "reasoning": "Triangular geometry provides stiffness. Adding node_4 above node_3 forms two triangles sharing node_4, distributing load from node_3. Member lengths calculated via distance formula. Use areas from given set to keep mass ≤30 and stress ≤30. Approximate axial forces by static equilibrium on nodes. Assume linear elastic, axial force only.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_1-node_3=2m, node_3-node_2=4m, node_1-node_4=√((2-0)^2+3^2)=3.605m, node_2-node_4=√((6-2)^2+3^2)=5m, node_3-node_4=3m. Assign areas starting from small to keep mass low. Check axial forces assuming load and reactions balance.",
    
    "calculation": "Mass=sum(length*area). Start with small areas for horizontal members (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2) area=1, vertical/diagonal members area=0.782 or 0.195. Estimate forces: load at node_3 is -10N at -45°, components Fx=-7.07N, Fy=-7.07N. Reactions at supports balance load. Members connected to node_3 carry load, members to node_4 carry compression/tension. Check max stress = force/area ≤30. Adjust areas accordingly.",
    "scratch_pad_final": "Final areas chosen to keep mass ≤30 and stress ≤30. Structure closed with 4 nodes and 5 members. Member connections unique, no duplicates. Node positions precise floats.",
