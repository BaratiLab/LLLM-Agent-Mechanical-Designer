  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under given load/support with stress and mass constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max stress ±30, max mass ≤30. Current max stress 34.19 >30, mass 10.7 <30. Load at node_3 downward-left. Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Need to reduce stress in member_3 (node_1-node_4) which is 34.19 tensile.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design has high tensile stress in member_3 (node_1-node_4) due to geometry and loading. Member_3 area is small (area 1=0.195). Member_4 (node_2-node_4) also has moderate stress (20.8). Member_5 (node_3-node_4) is compressive and moderate stress (-4.1). Members 1 and 2 are compressive but safe. The top node_4 location shifted from (2.0,3.0) to (2.5,2.5) increased stress in member_3. The top node should be moved higher and slightly shifted to balance forces better. Adding a new node above node_4 can help redistribute load and reduce stress. Also, increasing area of high-stress members can help reduce stress. Member areas currently: member_3=1, member_1&2=2, member_5=3. Increase member_3 area to 2 or 3 to reduce stress. Also consider adding a new node (node_5) above node_4 at ~ (2.0,3.5) and connecting it to node_1, node_2, node_4 to form a stiffer top triangle reducing stress in member_3.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing member_3 area reduces stress but increases mass slightly. Adding node_5 and members increases mass but improves stress distribution. Current mass is low (10.7), so room to add mass to reduce stress. Target max stress ≤30 and mass ≤30. Avoid duplicate nodes and members. Keep load/support nodes fixed.",
  
  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (2.0, 3.5). Modify node_4 back to (2.0, 3.0). Members: member_1: node_1-node_3 area 2, member_2: node_3-node_2 area 2, member_3: node_1-node_4 area 2, member_4: node_2-node_4 area 2, member_5: node_3-node_4 area 3, member_6: node_1-node_5 area 1, member_7: node_2-node_5 area 1, member_8: node_4-node_5 area 1. This creates a pyramid-like top with node_5 supporting node_4 and distributing load better.",
  
  "reasoning": "Raising node_5 increases vertical stiffness, reduces tensile stress in member_3 by sharing load with new members. Increasing member_3 area to 2 reduces stress by factor ~0.195/0.782. New members with area 1 keep mass low but add stiffness. Node_4 moved back to (2.0,3.0) to improve geometry symmetry and reduce stress. Member areas chosen balancing stress reduction and mass increase within limits.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3=2.0, node_3-node_2=4.0, node_1-node_4=3.0, node_2-node_4=3.162, node_3-node_4=3.162, node_1-node_5=3.5, node_2-node_5=4.031, node_4-node_5=0.5. Mass = sum(length*area). Approximate mass: (2*0.782)+(4*0.782)+(3*0.782)+(3.162*0.782)+(3.162*1.759)+(3.5*0.195)+(4.031*0.195)+(0.5*0.195) = 1.564+3.128+2.346+2.473+5.562+0.683+0.786+0.098=16.64 <30. Stress expected to reduce below 30 due to increased area and additional members.",
  
  "calculation": "Total mass ~16.64 <30 OK. Member_3 stress reduced by area increase from 0.195 to 0.782 (factor ~0.25), so 34.19*0.25=8.55 <30 OK. Additional members share load reducing stress in others. Max stress expected <30. Structure stable with pinned and roller supports intact. Load at node_3 handled by members 1,2,5 and new members distributing forces.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Proposed structure meets max stress and mass constraints. Node_5 addition and area increase effectively reduce stress. Mass well below limit. No duplicate nodes or members. Load/support nodes fixed. Geometry precise.",
