Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_5 moved closer to node_4 compared to previous iteration. Member areas mostly low-medium. Stress distribution uneven, member_1 compression highest. Objective is to reduce max stress further.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_1 has highest compressive stress (-13.07) and large area 2. Member_5 has notable compressive stress (-9.04) with area 2. Members 6 and 7 carry low tensile/compressive stress with small areas. Node_5 is close to node_4, which may increase stress in members connected to node_5. Current member areas for bottom chord (members 1 and 2) are medium (area 2). Top chord members 3,4,5 are also area 2. Members connected to node_5 have small areas 0 or 1. The structure is stable and within constraints but can reduce max stress by slight repositioning of node_5 and adjusting member areas to balance stress better.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_5 slightly upward and right to reduce stress concentration on member_1. Increase area of member_1 to 3 if needed, reduce area of less stressed members to compensate mass. Possibly increase area of member_5 to 3 to reduce its stress. Keep other members at area 2 or less. Ensure total mass <=30. Check stress impact after node move and area changes.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Moving node_5 slightly away from node_4 reduces stress in member_8 and redistributes forces in members 6 and 7. Increasing area of high-stress members (member_1 and member_5) reduces stress by increasing capacity. Reducing area of low-stress members (member_6 or 7) compensates mass increase. Node_5 position must remain close to node_4 to maintain closed truss shape and equilibrium. Load and support nodes fixed, so only node_5 can be moved. Use precise float values for node_5 position. Areas selected from given discrete set.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: calculate from node positions. Mass = sum(length * area_factor). Area factors: {\'0\':1, \'1\':0.195, \'2\':0.782, \'3\':1.759}. Current total mass 15.57, can increase area for few members. Stress reduction estimated by increasing area. Node_5 current pos: (2.1, 3.05). Try (2.15, 3.1) or (2.2, 3.1). Adjust member_1 area from 2 to 3. Adjust member_5 area from 2 to 3. Reduce member_6 area from 1 to 0. Keep member_7 at 1 or reduce to 0 if possible. Check mass and stress after changes.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node_5 moved to (2.15, 3.1). Member areas: member_1:3, member_2:2, member_3:2, member_4:2, member_5:3, member_6:0, member_7:1, member_8:0. Calculate member lengths: member_1 (node_1 to node_3): 2.0, member_5 (node_3 to node_4): length ~3.0, member_6 (node_1 to node_5): ~3.67 (area 0 reduces mass here), member_7 (node_2 to node_5): ~4.02.

Total mass ~3.518+3.128+2.346+2.82+5.277+3.67+0.784+1=22.543. Within 30 limit. Expected stress reduction in member_1 and member_5 due to increased area. Member_6 stress negligible, area 0 acceptable.
