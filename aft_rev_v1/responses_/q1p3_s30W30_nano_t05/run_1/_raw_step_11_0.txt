Node_5 slightly moved from initial.",\n  "analysis": "Stress distribution is well below limits, mass is moderate. Member_1 under highest compressive stress (-13), member_5 under moderate compression (-9). No constraint violations. Node_5 position and member areas seem effective.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further reducing stress would require major geometry or area changes, likely increasing mass or violating constraints.",\n  "reasoning": "Given constraints and current results, minimal stress is already achieved without exceeding mass. Node_5 position close to node_4 optimizes load path. Increasing areas would increase mass unnecessarily. Decreasing areas risks stress increase. Moving node_5 further risks instability or stress concentration.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member areas chosen mostly \'2\' (0.782) and \'1\' (0.195) for lighter mass.
