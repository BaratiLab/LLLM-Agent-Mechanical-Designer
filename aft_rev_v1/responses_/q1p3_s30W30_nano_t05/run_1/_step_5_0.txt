  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to reduce max stress while staying within mass and stress limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress ~13 < 30, total mass ~18.6 < 30. Load at node_3; supports at nodes 1 and 2 fixed. Node_5 added to reduce stress but mass increased. Members mostly area '1', '2', '3'.",
  "analysis": "Max stress is well below limit, mass is moderate. Stress distribution is fairly balanced, highest compressive stress on member_1 (-12.95). Members with higher areas (3) carry moderate stress. Load node_3 fixed; node_5 position can be adjusted for better force distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 has highest compressive stress; consider adjusting node_5 position to reduce load on member_1. Potentially reduce area of low-stress members to save mass or reposition node_5 to optimize force paths.",
  "reasoning": "To minimize max stress, redistribute forces by slightly moving node_5 vertically and horizontally within constraints (not changing load/support nodes). Current node_5 at (2.0, 3.5) can be moved slightly right and down to reduce stress on member_1 and member_8. Also, consider reducing area of member_8 (currently '1') to '0' if stress allows, saving mass without increasing stress. Maintain closed truss with all nodes connected.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas impact mass and stress. Current areas: member_1,2 = '2' (0.782), member_3,4 = '2', member_5 = '3'(1.759), members 6,7,8 = '1'(0.195). Max mass 30, current 18.6, room to increase areas if needed to reduce stress, but goal is to reduce stress with minimal mass increase.",
  "calculation": "Shift node_5 from (2.0, 3.5) to (2.3, 3.2) to improve force distribution: shortens member_6 and member_7, reduces bending in member_1 and member_8. Change member_8 area from '1' to '0' (1.0 to 0.195) to reduce mass slightly since stress is moderate (-7.21). Keep other areas same. Recalculate approximate member lengths and masses to confirm total mass < 30. Expected max stress reduction on member_1 and member_8.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_5 moved slightly right/down to optimize stress paths. Member_8 area reduced to save mass. All constraints met: max stress < 30, total mass < 30. Load/support nodes unchanged. No duplicate nodes or members. Closed truss maintained.",
