  "preamble": "Current 2D truss meets constraints with balanced stress and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress ~13 < 30, total mass ~15.66 < 30; load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_5 slightly moved from initial.",
  "analysis": "Stress distribution is well below limits, mass is moderate. Member_1 under highest compressive stress (-13), member_5 under moderate compression (-9). No constraint violations. Node_5 position and member areas seem effective.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further reducing stress would require major geometry or area changes, likely increasing mass or violating constraints.",
  "reasoning": "Given constraints and current results, minimal stress is already achieved without exceeding mass. Node_5 position close to node_4 optimizes load path. Increasing areas would increase mass unnecessarily. Decreasing areas risks stress increase. Moving node_5 further risks instability or stress concentration.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member areas chosen mostly '2' (0.782) and '1' (0.195) for lighter mass. Member_6 area '1' with moderate stress (5.53) is efficient. Member_8 area '0' (1) with low stress (-1.07) is acceptable.",
  "calculation": "No changes needed. Max stress is 13.06 within Â±30 limit. Total mass 15.66 well below 30. All nodal positions except load/support fixed. Node_5 at (2.1, 3.15) optimal for load transfer.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verified constraints met, no duplicates, node positions precise. Optimization converged at iteration 10 with stable design.",
