Constraints: max stress Â±30, max mass 30. Current mass 31.42 > 30. Max stress 12.1 < 30 (OK). Need to reduce mass primarily.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has 5 nodes (2 supports, 1 load, 2 added nodes) and 8 members, mass slightly above limit. Members with large areas (3) cause mass excess. Stress low, so area reduction possible. Node_5 at (2,4) adds vertical height but increases member length and mass. Members from node_1 and node_2 to node_5 are heavy. Structure can be simplified by removing node_5 and related members, redistributing members to reduce mass and maintain stability.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_5 and members connected to it. Keep node_4 at (2,3) for vertical support. Use members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4. Reduce area sizes to lower mass. Use smaller areas for longer members, larger for shorter or high load members. Aim total mass < 30, stress < 30.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_5 and its members. Use 4 nodes: node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4. Members: member_1: node_1-node_3, member_2: node_3-node_2, member_3: node_1-node_4, member_4: node_2-node_4, member_5: node_3-node_4. Assign areas to balance stress and mass: member_1 and member_2 area 2 (0.782), member_3 and member_4 area 1 (0.195), member_5 area 3 (1.759).",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing node_5 reduces mass significantly. Member_1 and member_2 carry horizontal forces, so medium area (2) to keep stress low. Members from supports to node_4 can be smaller area (1) as they primarily stabilize vertical load. Member_5 (diagonal from node_3 to node_4) carries load transfer, medium area (3) for stiffness. This layout is a classic triangular truss with minimal nodes and members, optimized for load and support conditions.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_3: 2.0m, node_3-node_2: 4.0m, node_1-node_4: sqrt(2^2+3^2)=3.605551275m, node_2-node_4: sqrt(4^2+3^2)=5.0m, node_3-node_4: 3.0m. Mass = sum(length*area_density). Areas: 0.782, 0.195, 1.759 from given table. Total mass approx: 2*0.782 + 3.605551275*0.195 + 5*0.195 + 3*1.759 = 1.564 + 0.703 + 0.975 + 5.277 = 8.519 kg approx, well below 30.
