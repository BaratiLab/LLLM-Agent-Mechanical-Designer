Node_4 is free to move vertically and horizontally except at load/support nodes.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_3 (node_1-node_4) at 29.05, near tensile limit. Members 1,2,5 have low stress. Mass is 11.65, well below 30. Load at node_3 fixed. Supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_4 position (2.0,3.0) can be optimized to reduce stress in member_3 and member_4 (node_2-node_4).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing height of node_4 may reduce tensile stress in member_3 and compressive in member_4. Also shifting node_4 slightly towards node_2 may balance forces better.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_3 is shortest with area 1 (0.195 area) but stressed near limit. Increasing area may increase mass unnecessarily. Better to adjust node_4 position to reduce stress. Moving node_4 lower and slightly right reduces member_3 length and changes force distribution, lowering peak stress. Keep node_4 x > 2.0 to avoid collinearity with node_1-node_3-node_2.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Try node_4 at (2.5, 2.5). Calculate approximate member lengths and expected stress reduction.
