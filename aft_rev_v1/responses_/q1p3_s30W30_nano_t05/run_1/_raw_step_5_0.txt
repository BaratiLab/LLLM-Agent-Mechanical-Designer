Load at node_3; supports at nodes 1 and 2 fixed. Node_5 added to reduce stress but mass increased. Members mostly area \'1\', \'2\', \'3\'.",\n  "analysis": "Max stress is well below limit, mass is moderate. Stress distribution is fairly balanced, highest compressive stress on member_1 (-12.95). Members with higher areas (3) carry moderate stress. Load node_3 fixed; node_5 position can be adjusted for better force distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 has highest compressive stress; consider adjusting node_5 position to reduce load on member_1. Potentially reduce area of low-stress members to save mass or reposition node_5 to optimize force paths.",\n  "reasoning": "To minimize max stress, redistribute forces by slightly moving node_5 vertically and horizontally within constraints (not changing load/support nodes). Current node_5 at (2.0, 3.5) can be moved slightly right and down to reduce stress on member_1 and member_8. Also, consider reducing area of member_8 (currently \'1\') to \'0\' if stress allows, saving mass without increasing stress. Maintain closed truss with all nodes connected.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas impact mass and stress.

Max mass 30, current 18.6, room to increase areas if needed to reduce stress, but goal is to reduce stress with minimal mass increase.",\n  "calculation": "Shift node_5 from (2.0, 3.5) to (2.3, 3.2) to improve force distribution: shortens member_6 and member_7, reduces bending in member_1 and member_8. Change member_8 area from \'1\' to \'0\' (1.0 to 0.195) to reduce mass slightly since stress is moderate (-7.21). Keep other areas same. Recalculate approximate member lengths and masses to confirm total mass < 30.
