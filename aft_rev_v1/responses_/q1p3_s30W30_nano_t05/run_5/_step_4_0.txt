  "preamble": "Current truss meets constraints with low max stress and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress is 10.93 < 30, mass 17.18 < 30. Load/support nodes fixed. Areas mostly small to moderate.",
  "analysis": "Stress is well below limits; mass is moderate. Node_4 moved closer to reduce stress from previous iterations. Member areas chosen to balance mass and strength. No constraint violations.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further node movement risks increasing stress or mass. Member areas are minimal for safety. Structure is statically determinate and stable.",
  "reasoning": "Minimizing stress further likely requires larger areas or node repositioning that violates constraints or increases mass. Current design is efficient with balanced stress distribution and minimal mass.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member_1 and member_4 carry highest stress but within limits. Member_5 area reduced to 0.782 from previous higher values to reduce mass while stress remains low. Node_4 position optimized to balance forces.",
  "calculation": "Total mass = 17.18 < 30, max stress = 10.93 < 30. Member lengths and areas consistent with stress and mass results. No duplicate nodes or members.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints satisfied, no improvement without violating constraints. Optimization converged.",
