  "preamble": "Optimizing node_4 position and member areas to reduce max stress and mass within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 22.01 < 30, total mass 16.6 < 30; stress concentrated in member_5. Node_4 moved down from 2.5 to 2.3 reducing mass and stress but member_5 stress still high.",
  "analysis": "Member_5 shows highest tensile stress (22.01), close to limit. Member_1 area increased to 3 causing more mass than needed. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_4 can be adjusted vertically and horizontally within design space to reduce stress concentration. Member areas can be optimized to reduce mass while keeping stresses below 30.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing member_5 area from 1 to 0.782 or 0.195 may reduce stress but risk increasing stress in other members. Slightly moving node_4 towards node_3 and lowering y may redistribute forces. Member_1 area can be reduced from 3 to 2 or 1 to save mass. Member_6 area can be maintained or slightly reduced.",
  "reasoning": "Reducing area of member_5 from 1 to 0.782 or 0.195 reduces mass and stress. Moving node_4 closer to node_3 horizontally (from 2.5 to about 2.3) and slightly down (from 2.3 to about 2.0) will reduce tension in member_5 and improve force distribution. Reducing member_1 area from 3 to 2 reduces mass without exceeding stress limits. Member_2 area can remain 1. Member_4 area can remain 2 to maintain stiffness.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and estimate stress redistribution:\n- member_5 length: from node_4 to node_2\n- moving node_4 closer to node_3 reduces length and tension in member_5\n- member_1 area reduction from 3 to 2 saves mass\n- total mass target < 17\n- max stress target < 20",
  "calculation": "Node_4 moved to (2.3, 2.0). Member areas: member_1: 2, member_2:1, member_3:2, member_4:2, member_5:0.782, member_6:3.\nEstimated length member_5 reduced, stress reduced below 20. Mass estimated ~16.\nMember_1 area reduced from 3 to 2, saving mass and stress still below limit.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no constraint violation: max stress <30, mass <30. Node_4 position changed within allowable. Load/support nodes unchanged. No duplicate nodes or members. Areas selected from given set.",
