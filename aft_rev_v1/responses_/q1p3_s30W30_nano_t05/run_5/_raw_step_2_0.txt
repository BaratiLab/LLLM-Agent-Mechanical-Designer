Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed, node_4 moved from y=3 to y=2.5 improved stress from 28.7 to 11.1. Member areas mostly \'2\' (0.782) except member_6 area \'3\' (1.759).",\n  "analysis": "Stress concentrated in member_1 (-11.15 compressive) and member_4 (8.53 tensile). Member_1 length ~2.69m, member_4 length ~3.20m. Reducing length or increasing cross-section area of high stress members can reduce stress. Node_4 vertical position affects load path and stress distribution. Current layout is good but node_4 position and member areas can be fine-tuned to reduce max stress further without exceeding mass limit.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider lowering node_4 slightly from 2.5 to ~2.3 to reduce member_1 length and stress. Slightly increase area of member_1 to area_id \'3\' (1.759) to reduce stress further. Decrease area of low stress members (member_2, member_5) to \'1\' (0.195) to compensate mass increase. Check mass sum remains below 30. Member_6 area can remain at \'3\'.",\n  "reasoning": "Reducing node_4 y-coordinate shortens member_1 and member_4, reducing axial force and stress. Increasing cross-section area of member_1 reduces stress by increasing capacity. Reducing areas of low stress members reduces mass to accommodate increased area in critical members. This balances stress and mass constraints optimally.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate new member lengths and areas. member_1 length = distance between node_1(0,0) and node_3(2,0) fixed at 2.0m. Node_4 moves from (2.5,2.5) to (2.5,2.3). member_4 length = distance node_1(0,0) to node_4(2.5,2.3) ~ sqrt(2.5^2 + 2.3^2) = 3.39m. member_1 area from 0.782 to 1.759 doubles capacity.
