  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under given load, supports, and constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 (-10N, -45Â°), supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current max stress 60.4 > 30 limit and mass 12.63 < 30 limit. Need to reduce stress by reconfiguring members and areas.",
  
  "analysis": "High compressive stress on member_1 connecting node_1 to node_3 causes failure. Current member_1 area is 0.195 (area_id '1'), too small for load. Members around node_3 form a triangle with node_4 at (3,3), but node_3 is at (2,0). Load direction induces high bending on member_1. To reduce stress, add a new node above node_3 to better distribute forces and add members to triangulate the structure, improving load path. Increase areas on critical members. Keep load and support nodes fixed.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_5 at (2.0, 2.0) above node_3. Connect node_5 to node_1, node_2, node_3, and node_4. Remove some inefficient members if needed. Use larger areas for members connected to node_3 and node_5. Aim to keep total mass <30 and max stress <Â±30.",
  
  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (2.0, 2.0). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_5, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_1, node_5-node_2. Assign areas: critical compressive members area_id '4' (3.128), others area_id '2' (0.782). Remove member_4 (node_3-node_4) to reduce redundancy and mass. This provides better triangulation and load distribution.",
  
  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 above node_3 creates a better load path for the inclined load at node_3. Members connected to node_5 help redistribute forces, lowering stress on member_1. Increasing area on member_1 and other critical members reduces stress below limits. Removing member_4 reduces mass and complexity. The new triangulation ensures stability and efficient force transfer.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths and assign areas:\n- member_1 (node_1-node_3): length=2.0, area=3.128\n- member_2 (node_3-node_2): length=4.0, area=0.782\n- member_3 (node_1-node_4): length=3.605551275, area=0.782\n- member_5 (node_2-node_4): length=3.16227766, area=0.782\n- member_6 (node_3-node_5): length=2.0, area=3.128\n- member_7 (node_4-node_5): length=1.41421356, area=0.782\n- member_8 (node_5-node_1): length=2.82842712, area=0.782\n- member_9 (node_5-node_2): length=4.12310563, area=0.782\nTotal mass approx sum(length*area) < 30. Stress expected to reduce due to better load path and increased areas.",
  
  "calculation": "Mass estimate:\nmember_1: 2.0*3.128=6.256\nmember_2: 4.0*0.782=3.128\nmember_3: 3.605551275*0.782=2.82\nmember_5: 3.16227766*0.782=2.47\nmember_6: 2.0*3.128=6.256\nmember_7: 1.41421356*0.782=1.106\nmember_8: 2.82842712*0.782=2.213\nmember_9: 4.12310563*0.782=3.224\nSum=6.256+3.128+2.82+2.47+6.256+1.106+2.213+3.224=27.473 <30\nStress expected <30 due to increased areas and improved geometry.",
