  "preamble": "Optimize a closed 2D truss with given nodes, loads, supports, minimizing stress within ±30 and mass ≤30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given 3 nodes on x-axis, load at node_3 downward-left, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Need closed truss (all nodes connected forming at least one closed loop).",
  
  "analysis": "Current nodes lie on a line: node_1(0,0), node_3(2,0), node_2(6,0). To form a closed truss, add at least one additional node above the line to form triangles, which are stable closed shapes. Load is at node_3 downward-left (-10 at -45°). Supports at ends allow horizontal and vertical reactions. Triangular truss is minimal closed shape, best for stability and stress distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 above line between node_1 and node_2, say at (3.0, 3.0) to form two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_3, node_2, node_4). Connect members accordingly to form closed loops.",

  "reasoning": "Triangular shapes efficiently handle loads with minimal members and distribute forces well. Adding node_4 at (3,3) creates two triangles, distributing load at node_3. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_2-node_4. Use areas from given discrete set, choose larger areas for members with higher stress and smaller for others to keep mass ≤30. Approximate member forces using static equilibrium and truss analysis assumptions: axial forces only, pin joints, load applied only at node_3.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths, estimate forces by method of joints at node_3, node_4. Use force components and equilibrium equations Fx=0, Fy=0 per node. Calculate stress = force / area. Choose area to keep stress ≤30. Calculate mass = sum(length * area). Adjust areas iteratively to meet constraints.",
