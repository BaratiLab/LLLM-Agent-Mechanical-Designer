To form a closed truss, add at least one additional node above the line to form triangles, which are stable closed shapes. Load is at node_3 downward-left (-10 at -45°). Supports at ends allow horizontal and vertical reactions. Triangular truss is minimal closed shape, best for stability and stress distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 above line between node_1 and node_2, say at (3.0, 3.0) to form two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_3, node_2, node_4).
