  "preamble": "Current structure meets constraints with low stress and acceptable mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress is 6.74 < 30, total mass 29.09 < 30, load and supports fixed, nodes adjusted for better stress distribution.",
  "analysis": "Stress is well below limits and mass is near max allowed. Members with highest stress are member_9 (6.74) and member_8 (5.68). Node_5 placement balances forces between node_1 and node_2. Further node movement risks increasing stress or mass.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing member areas further risks stress violation. Moving node_5 closer to line node_1-node_2 reduces triangle area, but may increase stress. Current member areas are balanced between strength and mass.",
  "reasoning": "Given constraints and current low max stress, further optimization offers marginal gains. Node_5 placement at (2.0, 2.0) provides good triangulation and load path. Member areas chosen from allowed set balance mass and strength. No redundant members or nodes exist.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas produce total mass near 29.1. Max stress 6.74 < 30. Load at node_3 fixed, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_5 moved from iteration 0 to 1 improved stress from 60+ to 6.7.",
  "calculation": "Member masses summed: ~29.09. Max stress 6.74 from member_9. No member exceeding Â±30. Node_5 at (2.0, 2.0) optimal for load path. Attempts to reduce member area increase stress beyond limits.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints satisfied, minimal max stress achieved, mass close to limit. No further improvement evident by node repositioning or area changes.",
