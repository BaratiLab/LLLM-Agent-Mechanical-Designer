Current max stress 60.4 > 30 limit and mass 12.63 < 30 limit. Need to reduce stress by reconfiguring members and areas.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High compressive stress on member_1 connecting node_1 to node_3 causes failure. Current member_1 area is 0.195 (area_id \'1\'), too small for load. Members around node_3 form a triangle with node_4 at (3,3), but node_3 is at (2,0). Load direction induces high bending on member_1. To reduce stress, add a new node above node_3 to better distribute forces and add members to triangulate the structure, improving load path. Increase areas on critical members. Keep load and support nodes fixed.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_5 at (2.0, 2.0) above node_3. Connect node_5 to node_1, node_2, node_3, and node_4. Remove some inefficient members if needed. Use larger areas for members connected to node_3 and node_5.

Assign areas: critical compressive members area_id \'4\' (3.128), others area_id \'2\' (0.782). Remove member_4 (node_3-node_4) to reduce redundancy and mass. This provides better triangulation and load distribution.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 above node_3 creates a better load path for the inclined load at node_3.
