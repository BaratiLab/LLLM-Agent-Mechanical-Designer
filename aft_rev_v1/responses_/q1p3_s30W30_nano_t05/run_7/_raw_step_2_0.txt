Members with highest stress are member_9 (6.74) and member_8 (5.68). Node_5 placement balances forces between node_1 and node_2. Further node movement risks increasing stress or mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing member areas further risks stress violation. Moving node_5 closer to line node_1-node_2 reduces triangle area, but may increase stress. Current member areas are balanced between strength and mass.",\n  "reasoning": "Given constraints and current low max stress, further optimization offers marginal gains. Node_5 placement at (2.0, 2.0) provides good triangulation and load path. Member areas chosen from allowed set balance mass and strength. No redundant members or nodes exist.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas produce total mass near 29.1. Max stress 6.74 < 30. Load at node_3 fixed, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed.
