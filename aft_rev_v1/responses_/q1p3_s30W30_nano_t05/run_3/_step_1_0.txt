  "preamble": "Current 2D truss meets all constraints with low max stress and mass under limit.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress ±13.06 well below ±30 limit; total mass 16.7 < 30 max. Load at node_3, supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller).",
  "analysis": "Current design has balanced member stresses, no overstressed members. Load path from node_3 to supports is effective. Node_4 placement provides good triangulation and stability. Member areas are moderate, maintaining mass efficiency.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further moving node_4 or changing member areas may reduce stress slightly but risk increasing mass or violating constraints.",
  "reasoning": "Stress is already low relative to allowed max; mass is well below max. Moving node_4 closer to load or supports risks stress concentration or instability. Current member areas are consistent with loads and lengths. Optimization likely yields marginal gains only.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas produce mass 16.7; max stress 13.06. Load at 45° downward at node_3 is well supported by members 1,2,4,5. No member close to stress limit.",
  "calculation": "No changes needed to node positions or member areas. Current design is efficient and satisfies constraints with margin.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met, no violation or near-limit stresses. Optimization stopped to avoid unnecessary changes.",
