No node moves allowed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Nodes lie on x-axis; node_3 loaded downward-left. To form closed truss, add new node(s) above baseline to create triangular loops for stiffness. Triangles reduce bending, distribute forces. Supports at ends, load near left end. Adding one node above node_3, say node_4, to form two triangles: (node_1-node_3-node_4) and (node_3-node_2-node_4). This creates closed loop with 4 nodes and 5 members. Check member lengths and assign areas to keep stress and mass within limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_4 placed vertically above node_3 at y>0 for better load transfer. Members: (1-3), (3-2), (1-4), (3-4), (2-4). Calculate lengths, estimate forces by static equilibrium, use axial stress = force/area. Use area choices to keep stress ≤30 and mass ≤30.

Equilibrium: sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, sum moments=0. Members carry axial forces. Triangular geometry ensures axial load paths. Use truss analysis to estimate member forces. Choose areas from given set to keep stress ≤30. Use smaller areas where forces are low to reduce mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic, axial forces only, static equilibrium. Use method of joints or sections for forces. Stress = force/area. Use area units consistent with force units. Mass proportional to length*area. Approximate forces by resolving load and reactions.
