Load at node_3, supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller).",\n  "analysis": "Current design has balanced member stresses, no overstressed members. Load path from node_3 to supports is effective. Node_4 placement provides good triangulation and stability. Member areas are moderate, maintaining mass efficiency.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further moving node_4 or changing member areas may reduce stress slightly but risk increasing mass or violating constraints.",\n  "reasoning": "Stress is already low relative to allowed max; mass is well below max. Moving node_4 closer to load or supports risks stress concentration or instability. Current member areas are consistent with loads and lengths. Optimization likely yields marginal gains only.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas produce mass 16.7; max stress 13.06.
