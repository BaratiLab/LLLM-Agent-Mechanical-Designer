  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position and member areas to reduce max stress while respecting mass and stress limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 8.53 < 30, mass 20.58 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved from (3,3) to (3.5,3.5) in last step, reducing max stress from 12.1 to 8.5. Member areas mostly 2 or 3. Objective: minimize max stress further.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_4 (node_1-node_4) at 8.53 tensile. Member_2 and member_1 are compressive but lower. Mass is well below limit, so some area increase is possible if it reduces stress. Node_4 moved upward and right increased triangle height, balancing forces better. Further adjusting node_4 position slightly upward and left may reduce stress on member_4. Also, consider reducing area on low-stress members (like member_3) to save mass and increase area on critical members to reduce stress.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Mass budget available ~9.4 units. Areas can be adjusted within given discrete levels. Node_4 can move within reasonable range around (3.5,3.5) without breaking geometry or constraints. Members form a closed quadrilateral: node_1-node_3-node_4-node_2-node_1. Keep load/support nodes fixed.",

  "reasoning": "To reduce max stress on member_4, reduce its length or increase its area. Length reduction limited by node_1 fixed at (0,0), so move node_4 slightly left/down to shorten member_4. But moving node_4 down reduces triangle height, may increase stress elsewhere. Alternatively, increase area of member_4 from 2 (0.782) to 3 (1.759) to reduce stress by increasing cross-sectional area. To compensate mass, reduce area on low stress members like member_3 (currently area 2) to 1 (0.195). Member_1 and member_2 at area 3 are fine. Member_5 at area 2 can be reduced to 1 if stress allows. Check stress signs and magnitudes to confirm.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member_4 length currently ~ sqrt(3.5^2 + 3.5^2) = 4.95. Increasing area from 0.782 to 1.759 doubles area, halves stress roughly. Member_3 length ~ 4.0, stress -2.15 compressive, can reduce area from 0.782 to 0.195 to save mass. Member_5 length ~ sqrt((6-3.5)^2 + (0-3.5)^2) = 4.3, stress 3.7 tensile, can reduce area cautiously. Total mass recalculated after area changes to ensure <= 30.",

  "calculation": "Adjust node_4 to (3.3, 3.7) to shorten member_4 slightly and increase height for better force distribution. Set member_4 area to '3' (1.759), member_3 area to '1' (0.195), member_5 area to '1' (0.195). Keep others same. Estimate mass:\nmember_1: length ~ sqrt(2^2 + 0^2) = 2, area 1.759, mass ~3.518 (unchanged)\nmember_2: length ~ sqrt((3.3-2)^2 + (3.7-0)^2) ~ sqrt(1.3^2 + 3.7^2) ~3.9, area 1.759, mass ~6.86\nmember_3: length ~ sqrt((6-2)^2 + 0^2) =4, area 0.195, mass ~0.78\nmember_4: length ~ sqrt(3.3^2 + 3.7^2) ~4.95, area 1.759, mass ~8.7\nmember_5: length ~ sqrt((6-3.3)^2 + (0-3.7)^2) ~4.5, area 0.195, mass ~0.88\nTotal mass ~3.52 + 6.86 + 0.78 + 8.7 + 0.88 = 20.74 < 30\nStress expected to reduce on member_4 due to increased area and slightly shorter length. Low area on member_3 and 5 reduces mass without increasing stress beyond limits.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved to (3.3, 3.7), member_4 area increased to 3, member_3 and member_5 areas reduced to 1. Mass and stress limits satisfied. Expect max stress < previous 8.53. Continue optimization next iteration unless no improvement.",
