  "preamble": "Optimize truss stress by adjusting internal node and member areas.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 12.09 < 30, mass 20.83 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_3 can move along x-axis only as load/support nodes fixed. Node_4 can be moved to optimize geometry.",
  
  "analysis": "Current max stress on member_3 (-12.09) is highest, area is smallest (0.195). Members with larger areas have lower stress. Adjusting node_4 position to optimize force distribution can reduce max stress. Possibly increase area of highly stressed members to reduce stress. Node_3 fixed at (2,0) due to load node constraint. Node_4 can be moved vertically and horizontally within limits to optimize geometry.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_3 connects node_3(2,0) to node_2(6,0), area 0.195, high compressive stress. Increasing area of member_3 can reduce stress but increases mass. Alternatively, reposition node_4 to change force path and reduce member_3 stress. Try moving node_4 slightly right and upwards to better distribute load. Adjust member areas to balance mass and stress.",
  
  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 from (3,3) to (3.5,3.5) increases triangle area and changes force angles, potentially reducing load on member_3. Increase member_3 area from '1' (0.195) to '2' (0.782) to reduce stress. Slightly reduce member_2 area from '4' (3.128) to '3' (1.759) as it has low stress. Keep other areas or slightly adjust to balance mass. Total mass should remain below 30. This should reduce max stress below current 12.09 while keeping mass acceptable.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths with new node_4 at (3.5,3.5):\nmember_1: node_1(0,0)-node_3(2,0) length=2\nmember_2: node_3(2,0)-node_4(3.5,3.5) length=√(1.5²+3.5²)=3.8079\nmember_3: node_3(2,0)-node_2(6,0) length=4\nmember_4: node_1(0,0)-node_4(3.5,3.5) length=√(3.5²+3.5²)=4.95\nmember_5: node_4(3.5,3.5)-node_2(6,0) length=√(2.5²+3.5²)=4.301\nMass = Σ(length × area)\nAssign areas: member_1='3'(1.759), member_2='3'(1.759), member_3='2'(0.782), member_4='2'(0.782), member_5='2'(0.782)\nMass = 2*1.759 + 3.8079*1.759 + 4*0.782 + 4.95*0.782 + 4.301*0.782 = 3.518 + 6.7 + 3.128 + 3.87 + 3.36 = 20.58 < 30\nStress expected to reduce due to larger areas on critical members and better geometry.",
  
  "calculation": "Updated node_4 to (3.5, 3.5). Increased member_3 area to '2' (0.782) from '1' (0.195) to reduce stress. Slightly reduced member_2 area to '3' (1.759) from '4' (3.128) to save mass. Adjusted member_4 and member_5 areas to '2' (0.782). Member_1 area kept at '3' (1.759). Total mass ~20.58, max stress expected <12.09 due to increased area and improved geometry. Node_3 fixed at (2,0) per constraints. Supports unchanged.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved to (3.5,3.5) to optimize load path. Areas adjusted to balance mass and reduce max stress. Mass under limit. Stress expected to reduce.
