Adjusting node_4 position to optimize force distribution can reduce max stress. Possibly increase area of highly stressed members to reduce stress. Node_3 fixed at (2,0) due to load node constraint.

Try moving node_4 slightly right and upwards to better distribute load. Adjust member areas to balance mass and stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 from (3,3) to (3.5,3.5) increases triangle area and changes force angles, potentially reducing load on member_3.
