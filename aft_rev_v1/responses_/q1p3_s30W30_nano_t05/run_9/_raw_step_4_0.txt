Load and support nodes fixed. Areas mostly moderate (2 or 3).",\n  "analysis": "Stress is well below limit, mass is below max. Members have balanced stress distribution. Node_4 repositioned in previous iterations to reduce stress. Current design stable and efficient.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further reducing stress would require major geometry or area changes risking constraint violations or complexity increase.",\n  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 closer to center reduced stress from previous high values. Area selections balance mass and strength. Load node_3 and supports fixed, so limited freedom. Current max stress is low and uniform, no member near limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress min at 6.7, mass 24.4; further mass reduction risks stress increase.
