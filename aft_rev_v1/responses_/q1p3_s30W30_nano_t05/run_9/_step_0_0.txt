  "preamble": "Optimize a closed 2D truss with given nodes, loads, supports, minimizing stress and mass within constraints.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given three nodes with fixed positions and supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Load applied at node_3 downward-left. Objective: closed truss, max stress ±30, max mass 30. Areas discrete from 0 to 10 with associated values. Need to add members to form closed loop including all nodes. Node positions fixed, so optimize member connections and cross-sectional areas.",
  
  "analysis": "Nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Load at node_3 is -10 magnitude at -45°, so force components Fx = -10*cos(45°) ≈ -7.07, Fy = -10*sin(45°) ≈ -7.07 downward-left. Supports: pinned at node_1 restrains both directions, roller at node_2 restrains vertical only. Closed truss requires at least a triangle connecting all nodes. Current nodes are colinear (all on x-axis), so truss is a line, not stable. To form a closed truss, add a new node above line to create a triangle. Position new node above line between node_1 and node_2 to maintain stability and reduce member lengths. Optimal height for new node can be near 3.0 units above x-axis to balance forces and keep members short.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (3.0, 3.0). Connect members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_4-node_3, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3 to form closed truss with diagonals. Select member areas to keep stress ≤30 and mass ≤30. Use equilibrium and truss analysis assumptions (axial forces only). Approximate member lengths and forces with static equilibrium and trigonometry.",
  
  "reasoning": "Adding node_4 at (3.0, 3.0) creates a triangular geometry. Members: (1-3), (3-2), (1-4), (4-2), (3-4) form closed loop. Load at node_3 creates tension/compression in members. Use small area for long members to reduce mass, larger area for members under higher load. Approximate member lengths: 1-3=2.0, 3-2=4.0, 1-4=√(3²+3²)=4.2426, 4-2=√(3²+3²)=4.2426, 3-4=√((3-2)²+(3-0)²)=√(1+9)=3.1623. Estimate forces by method of joints or sections. Use discrete areas from given set to keep stress ≤30. Assume linear elastic behavior, axial forces only, neglect self-weight.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate approximate axial forces using method of joints at node_3: external load (-7.07, -7.07). Members connected: 1-3, 3-2, 3-4. Assume member 1-3 and 3-2 carry axial forces balancing horizontal load, 3-4 carries vertical component. Use equilibrium Fx=0 and Fy=0 to solve forces. Calculate stress = force/area. Select areas accordingly. Calculate mass = sum(length × area). Verify mass ≤30 and max stress ≤30.",
