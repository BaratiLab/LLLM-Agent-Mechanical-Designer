  "stop": "True",
  "preamble": "Current structure meets constraints with low max stress and acceptable mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress is 6.7 < 30 limit, mass 24.4 < 30 max. Load and support nodes fixed. Areas mostly moderate (2 or 3).",
  "analysis": "Stress is well below limit, mass is below max. Members have balanced stress distribution. Node_4 repositioned in previous iterations to reduce stress. Current design stable and efficient.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further reducing stress would require major geometry or area changes risking constraint violations or complexity increase.",
  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 closer to center reduced stress from previous high values. Area selections balance mass and strength. Load node_3 and supports fixed, so limited freedom. Current max stress is low and uniform, no member near limits.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress min at 6.7, mass 24.4; further mass reduction risks stress increase. Areas 2 and 3 chosen for stiffness and mass trade-off. Geometry symmetric enough for load distribution.",
  "calculation": "No changes to nodal positions or member areas recommended. Current design optimal within constraints and instructions.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met, no member stress > 6.7 (<<30), total mass 24.4 < 30. Load/support nodes fixed. No duplicated members/nodes. Node positions precise.",
