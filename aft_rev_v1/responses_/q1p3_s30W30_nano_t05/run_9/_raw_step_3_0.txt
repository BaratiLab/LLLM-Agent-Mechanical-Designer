Load on node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_4 moved from 3.5,3.5 to 3.3,3.7 increased stress in member_5. Need to reduce member_5 stress by repositioning node_4 and adjusting member areas.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_5 is highly stressed at 14.96 (near max tensile). Member_3 also moderately stressed at 8.82 (compressive). Members 1,2,4 have lower stresses. Areas currently: member_1(3), member_2(3), member_3(1), member_4(3), member_5(1). Larger areas on highly stressed members can reduce stress. Node_4\'s position affects force distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_4 slightly closer to node_2 to reduce member_5 stress, or adjusting member_5 area from 1 to 2 or 3. Also consider reducing area of low-stress members to save mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing area of member_5 from 1(0.195) to 2(0.782) or 3(1.759) reduces stress. But mass increases. Alternatively, moving node_4 closer to node_2 reduces length and stress in member_5. Slightly lowering node_4 y-coordinate may balance forces better. Also, member_3 area is 1(0.195), can increase to 2(0.782) to reduce its compressive stress. Areas of members 1 and 2 at 3(1.759) seem acceptable. Member_4 area 3(1.759) could be reduced if stress is low to save mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: m5 (node_4 to node_2), currently length ~ sqrt((6-3.3)^2 + (0-3.7)^2) = sqrt(2.7^2 + 3.7^2) = sqrt(7.29 + 13.69)= sqrt(20.98)=4.58. Reducing node_4 y from 3.7 to ~3.3 reduces length to sqrt(2.7^2 + 3.3^2)= sqrt(7.29 + 10.89)= sqrt(18.18)=4.26, ~7% shorter. Stress roughly proportional to force/area, shorter length reduces force in member. Increase area of member_5 to 2(0.782) reduces stress by factor ~4x compared to area 1(0.195). Member_3 length: node_3 to node_2 (2,0) to (6,0) = 4.0. Increasing area from 1(0.195) to 2(0.782) reduces stress by ~4x. Check mass impact: member_5 mass = length * area. Current mass 0.893 for member_5 with area 1 and length ~4.58. Increasing area to 2 multiplies mass by ~4, so mass ~3.6. Current total mass 20.81 + (3.6 - 0.893) = 23.52, still below 30. Member_3 mass current 0.78, increasing area to 2 multiplies by 4, mass ~3.12, +2.34 mass increase total ~25.8 still below 30.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Move node_4 from (3.3,3.7) to (3.3,3.3) to reduce member_5 length and stress.
