  "preamble": "Optimize truss node positions to reduce max stress and mass within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 11.76 < 30, total mass 20.03 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Aim to reduce stress further by improving geometry and possibly reducing member areas.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design has low max stress, but mass is moderate. Members with area '2' (0.782) are used extensively, some with high stress (member_1: -11.76). Node_5 is high (y=5.0), creating longer members with moderate stress. Members with large length and moderate area contribute to mass. Load at node_3 downward-left (-10, -45Â°). Supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller) fixed, cannot move. Node_3 can move along x-axis since it is a load node, so no move allowed. Node_4 and node_5 can be adjusted vertically or horizontally except node_3. Aim to reduce stress by adjusting node_4 and node_5 positions to improve force distribution and reduce member length and stress concentration. Possibly reduce some member areas where stress is low to reduce mass.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing length of members from node_5 to node_1, node_3, and node_2 to reduce mass and stress. Slightly lower node_5 to reduce long members. Adjust node_4 position to balance forces between node_1, node_3, and node_2. Consider reducing area of low-stress members to area '1' or '0' to reduce mass. Keep closed truss shape.",
  
  "reasoning": "Reducing length of long members reduces mass and stress. Moving node_5 down from 5.0 to approx 4.0 reduces member length and stress. Adjust node_4 horizontally slightly towards node_3 (e.g., x=1.8) and slightly lower (e.g., y=3.3) to better distribute forces. This will reduce bending moments and stress in members connected to node_4. Members with stress less than 5 can have area reduced from '2' to '1' or '0' to save mass. Member_8 has low stress (2.72), area can be reduced from '2' to '1'. Member_6 stress (4.58) can reduce area from '2' to '1'. Member_7 stress (-6.37) moderate, keep area '2'. Member_4 low stress (-2.67) can reduce area from '2' to '1'. Member_1 stress high (-11.76), keep area '2'. Member_2 stress (-10.89), keep area '1'. Member_3 stress (8.22), keep area '1'. Member_5 stress (5.42), keep area '1'.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Adjust node_5 y: 5.0 -> 4.0; node_4 x: 2.0 -> 1.8, y: 3.5 -> 3.3. Update areas: member_4: 2->1, member_6: 2->1, member_8: 2->1. Member_7 keep 2 due to moderate stress. Calculate approximate length and mass changes:\n- member_6 length ~ sqrt((0-0)^2 + (4.0-0)^2) = 4.0, area 2->1 mass halves\n- member_8 length ~ sqrt((6-0)^2 + (4.0-0)^2) ~ 7.21, area reduced, mass reduced\n- member_4 length reduces slightly due to node_4 move\nEstimate mass reduction ~5 units, stress reduction expected due to better geometry and smaller areas.",
