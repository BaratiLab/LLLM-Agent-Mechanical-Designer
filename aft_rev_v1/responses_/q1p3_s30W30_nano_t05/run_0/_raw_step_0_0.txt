To form a closed truss, add a new node above x-axis to form a triangular shape, enabling load transfer and reducing stress. Supports at ends provide boundary conditions. Load at node_3 downward-left. The truss members should be chosen to minimize stresses and mass. Use simple truss assumptions: axial forces only, static equilibrium, linear elastic behavior. Choose areas to keep stress within ±30. Mass is sum of member lengths × area. Use length in meters, area dimensionless as per given set.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 above node_3 to form a triangle.

Use static equilibrium at node_3 (loaded) to find forces in members connected to it. Assume tension positive, compression negative.
