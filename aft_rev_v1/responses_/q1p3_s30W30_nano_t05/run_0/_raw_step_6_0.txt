Current max stress 16.67 well below limit, mass 9.18 also well below. Load at node_3, supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. Members mostly small areas (1 or 2).",\n  "analysis": "Max stress concentrated in member_6 (node_5-node_1) at 16.67, which is tensile. Member_2 and member_4 also have relatively high compressive stress (~15 and 14). Areas for members are mostly small (1 or 2). Node_5 moved closer to node_1 and node_3 in iteration 5, reducing mass and stress compared to iteration 4. Node_4 raised slightly to 3.2 height, node_5 lowered to 3.4 from 3.8. The structure is stable and within constraints. The goal is to reduce max stress further by better node placement and possibly adjusting member areas to better distribute loads.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_6 (node_5-node_1) stress is high tensile; shortening or repositioning node_5 can reduce tension. Member_2 (node_3-node_2) and member_4 (node_4-node_3) have high compression; possibly adjusting node_4 position to reduce compression forces. Areas can be increased selectively to reduce stress, but mass should be kept low.",\n  "reasoning": "To minimize max stress, reposition node_5 slightly closer to node_1 and reduce height to relieve tension in member_6. Raise node_4 slightly and shift horizontally to reduce compression in member_4 and member_2. Keep node_3 fixed due to load, node_1 and node_2 fixed due to supports. Use area \'1\' or \'2\' mostly to limit mass. Possibly increase area of member_6 from \'1\' to \'2\' to reduce stress in that member without large mass penalty. Member_7 area can remain \'2\' as stress is low. Member_8 area can remain \'1\' or \'2\' depending on stress reduction.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and approximate stresses with proposed node shifts. Node_5 from (1.8,3.4) to (1.75,3.2) reduces length of member_6 and tension. Node_4 from (1.9,3.2) to (1.95,3.4) raises height to reduce compression in member_4. Member_6 area increased from \'1\' to \'2\' to reduce stress by half approximately. Member_8 area increased from \'1\' to \'2\' to reduce tensile stress. Check total mass: sum(length*area) remains below 30. Verify no member exceeds ±30 stress.",\n  "calculation": "Member lengths approximate: member_6 length ~ sqrt((1.75-0)^2 + (3.2-0)^2) = ~3.62; member_8 length ~ sqrt((6-1.75)^2 + (0-3.2)^2) = ~4.76. Mass member_6 = 3.62 * 0.782 = 2.83; member_8 = 4.76 * 0.782 = 3.72. Total mass including others estimated ~12 (within limit).
