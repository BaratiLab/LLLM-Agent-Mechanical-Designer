  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 and node_5 positions to reduce max stress while keeping mass under 30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress ~12.9 < 30, total mass ~13.7 < 30. Load at node_3, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_4 and node_5 movable. Member areas mostly small to moderate.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is well below limit, but member_8 stress is high tensile (12.42). Mass is moderate. Node_4 and node_5 positions can be adjusted to better distribute forces and reduce stress peaks. Member_6 has area '0' (area=1), relatively heavy. Consider reducing area or repositioning nodes to reduce stress and mass. Current structure is stable with closed truss formed by nodes 1-4-5-3-2. Load at node_3 downward-left causes tension/compression in members connected to node_3. Node_4 and node_5 slightly shifted from previous iteration to reduce stress. Further fine tuning can reduce max stress and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on moving node_4 slightly closer to node_3 and node_5 slightly lower to reduce member lengths and redistribute forces. Possibly reduce area of member_6 from '0' to '1' or '2' if stress allows. Maintain closed truss with 8 members. Avoid increasing mass beyond 30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Reducing node_5 y-coordinate slightly reduces length of members 6,7,8, decreasing mass and stress. Moving node_4 slightly closer to node_3 can reduce stress in members 3,4,5. Area of member_6 (node_5-node_1) is largest (area=1) and contributes most mass. Consider reducing area to '1' (0.195) if stress allows. Member_8 has high tensile stress, so increasing area slightly might help. Member_7 is in compression moderate stress, area '2' is reasonable. Member_1 and 2 areas seem well chosen. Keep load/support nodes fixed. No duplicate nodes or members.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculations: member_6 length ~ distance(node_5-node_1), currently ~ sqrt((1.9-0)^2 + (4.2-0)^2) ~4.6. Reducing node_5 y to ~3.8 shortens member_6 to ~4.3, mass reduces proportionally. Member_8 length ~ distance(node_5-node_2) ~ sqrt((6-1.9)^2 + (0-4.2)^2) ~5.3. Lowering node_5 reduces length and stress. Node_4 position at (1.9,3.1) can shift closer to node_3 (2,0) horizontally to about (1.85,3.0) to reduce tension in member_3 and compression in member_4.",
  
  "calculation": "Adjust node_4 to (1.85, 3.0), node_5 to (1.9, 3.8). Change member_6 area from '0' to '1' (reduce mass). Keep member_7 area '2', member_8 area '2' to maintain strength. Recalculate total mass: member_6 length ~4.3 * 0.195 = 0.8385 (down from 4.6*1=4.6), mass reduction ~3.76. Total mass new ~ 13.7 - 3.76 + 0.8385 = ~10.78. Expected max stress should reduce due to shorter members and better force distribution, likely max stress < 12. Keep other areas unchanged. Structure remains closed with 8 members.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node moves and area reduction keep mass and stress well within limits. No load/support nodes moved. No duplicate nodes/members. Closed truss maintained. Stress minimized further. Stop condition not met, continue optimization.",
