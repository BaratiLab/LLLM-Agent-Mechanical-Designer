Load and support nodes fixed. Members and areas consistent.",\n  "analysis": "Stress levels are well below allowable limits, mass is less than half the max allowed. Current node positions and member areas produce balanced stress distribution. Further node adjustments risk increasing stress or mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Small stress margin remains, but improvements likely marginal. Member areas mostly moderate (1,2), no overstressed members.",\n  "reasoning": "Given constraints and FEM results, the current design is structurally efficient. Load path is well distributed. Moving free nodes risks stress increase or mass penalty. Areas chosen balance strength and weight. No members near stress or mass limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress max 15.7 < 30, mass 14.3 < 30.
