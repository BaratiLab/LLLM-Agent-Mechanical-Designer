  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 and node_5 positions to reduce max stress and maintain constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 16.5 < 30, total mass 9.87 < 30. Load at node_3, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_4 and node_5 movable. Members mostly area 1 or 2. Stress concentrated on member_6 (node_5-node_1) at 16.5. Aim to reduce stress in member_6 by adjusting node_5 location and possibly node_4 for better load path.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_6 has max tensile stress 16.5, relatively high compared to others. Node_5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3. Moving node_5 slightly upward and closer to node_3 may reduce stress on member_6 by redistributing forces. Node_4 moved slightly inward and downward in iteration 2, reduced mass and stress but member_6 still high. Also consider reducing area of member_6 from '1' to '0' (area=0.195) if stress allows or redistribute forces by geometry.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try moving node_5 closer to node_3 horizontally (from x=2.0 to ~1.9) and slightly upward (y=4.0 to ~4.2). Move node_4 slightly more toward center (x=1.8 to ~1.9) and slightly down (y=3.3 to ~3.1). Keep member areas same except reduce member_6 area to '1' or '0' if stress reduces. Check total mass and stress after changes.",
  
  "reasoning": "Reducing distance between node_5 and node_3 reduces length and stress in member_6. Moving node_4 closer to node_3 improves force distribution in upper members. Keeping areas mostly low reduces mass but must keep stress within limits. Member_6 stress is tensile and close to max, reducing length or area can help reduce stress. Member_7 area 2 is reasonable to keep for load transfer. Member_6 area can be tried at '1' or '0' depending on stress. Total mass must stay under 30, current is 9.87, so some margin for area increase if needed.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculations: member_6 length = distance(node_5, node_1). Current node_5 (2.0,4.0), node_1 (0,0), length ~4.472. Moving node_5 to (1.9,4.2) length ~4.56 (slightly longer). Need to balance horizontal shift and vertical shift. Member_6 area currently '1' (0.195), mass = length * area. Stress proportional to force / area. If length increases slightly but force decreases due to geometry, net stress can reduce. Member_4 and member_5 also important for load path, keep them stable.",
  
  "calculation": "Update node_4: (1.9, 3.1), node_5: (1.9, 4.2). Keep member areas same except reduce member_6 area to '0' (0.195) from '1' (1.0) to reduce mass and stress. Confirm no duplicate members or nodes. Estimated total mass still < 30. Anticipate max stress reduced below current 16.5 due to better force distribution and smaller area in member_6.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify constraints: max stress < 30, total mass < 30, no load/support node moved, no duplicate nodes/members, areas selected from allowed set. Node movements small but effective for stress reduction. Ready for next iteration or stop if stress sufficiently minimized.",
