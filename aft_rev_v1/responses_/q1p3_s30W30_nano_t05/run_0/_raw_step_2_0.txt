Load at node_3, supports fixed. Aim to reduce stress further by improving geometry and possibly reducing member areas.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has low max stress, but mass is moderate. Members with area \'2\' (0.782) are used extensively, some with high stress (member_1: -11.76). Node_5 is high (y=5.0), creating longer members with moderate stress. Members with large length and moderate area contribute to mass. Load at node_3 downward-left (-10, -45Â°). Supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller) fixed, cannot move. Node_3 can move along x-axis since it is a load node, so no move allowed. Node_4 and node_5 can be adjusted vertically or horizontally except node_3. Aim to reduce stress by adjusting node_4 and node_5 positions to improve force distribution and reduce member length and stress concentration. Possibly reduce some member areas where stress is low to reduce mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing length of members from node_5 to node_1, node_3, and node_2 to reduce mass and stress. Slightly lower node_5 to reduce long members. Adjust node_4 position to balance forces between node_1, node_3, and node_2. Consider reducing area of low-stress members to area \'1\' or \'0\' to reduce mass. Keep closed truss shape.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Reducing length of long members reduces mass and stress. Moving node_5 down from 5.0 to approx 4.0 reduces member length and stress. Adjust node_4 horizontally slightly towards node_3 (e.g., x=1.8) and slightly lower (e.g., y=3.3) to better distribute forces. This will reduce bending moments and stress in members connected to node_4. Members with stress less than 5 can have area reduced from \'2\' to \'1\' or \'0\' to save mass. Member_8 has low stress (2.72), area can be reduced from \'2\' to \'1\'. Member_6 stress (4.58) can reduce area from \'2\' to \'1\'. Member_7 stress (-6.37) moderate, keep area \'2\'. Member_4 low stress (-2.67) can reduce area from \'2\' to \'1\'. Member_1 stress high (-11.76), keep area \'2\'. Member_2 stress (-10.89), keep area \'1\'. Member_3 stress (8.22), keep area \'1\'.
