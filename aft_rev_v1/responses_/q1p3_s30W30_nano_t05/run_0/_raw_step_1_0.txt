Constraints: max stress ±30, max mass 30. Current max stress 50.08 > 30, mass 5.73 < 30. Need to reduce stress mainly in member_1.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has high compressive stress (-50) in member_1 between node_1 and node_3. Member_1 area is 0.195, length 2.0m. Increasing area of member_1 or adding alternative load paths can reduce stress. Node_4 at (2,3.5) creates a triangle. Members 3,4,5 connect node_4 to nodes 1,3,2. Member_4 has area 0.782 and low stress (-9). Member_5 has moderate stress (18). The load path is concentrated on member_1. Adding an additional node above node_3 may help redistribute forces. Reorienting or adding members from node_4 or adding a node between node_3 and node_4 can reduce stress in member_1.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Options: increase area of member_1 (to area 0.782 or 1.759), add a new node above node_3 and connect to node_1 and node_2, or add diagonal members to distribute load. Keep total mass <30, so increasing area moderately and adding members with small areas is acceptable.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node (node_5) at (2.0, 5.0) above node_4 to create a taller truss. Connect node_5 to node_1, node_3, and node_2 with members of moderate area to redistribute load. Increase area of member_1 from 0.195 to 0.782 to reduce stress. Keep other members\' areas as is or slightly adjust to balance stresses. This will create a stable truss with multiple load paths and reduce stress in member_1 below ±30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 higher up extends the truss height, reducing axial force in member_1 by providing alternate load paths through node_5. Increasing member_1 area reduces stress by increasing cross-section. Connections from node_5 to nodes 1, 3, and 2 form additional triangles, improving stability and load distribution. Areas chosen from given set to balance mass and strength. Member lengths calculated from node coordinates. Total mass checked to remain below 30.
