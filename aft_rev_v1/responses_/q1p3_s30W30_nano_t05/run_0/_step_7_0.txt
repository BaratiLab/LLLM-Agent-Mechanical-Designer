  "preamble": "Current 2D truss satisfies constraints with minimized stress.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 15.72 < 30, total mass 14.32 < 30. Load and support nodes fixed. Members and areas consistent.",
  "analysis": "Stress levels are well below allowable limits, mass is less than half the max allowed. Current node positions and member areas produce balanced stress distribution. Further node adjustments risk increasing stress or mass.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Small stress margin remains, but improvements likely marginal. Member areas mostly moderate (1,2), no overstressed members.",
  "reasoning": "Given constraints and FEM results, the current design is structurally efficient. Load path is well distributed. Moving free nodes risks stress increase or mass penalty. Areas chosen balance strength and weight. No members near stress or mass limits.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress max 15.7 < 30, mass 14.3 < 30. Members with area '2' and '1' provide adequate stiffness. Nodes at (1.95,3.4) and (1.75,3.2) provide good triangulation.",
  "calculation": "No changes needed as max stress and mass constraints satisfied. Node movement limited to free nodes, but current placement optimal for load transfer. Member areas consistent with stress demands.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Current design optimal under given constraints and load. No further optimization justified.",
