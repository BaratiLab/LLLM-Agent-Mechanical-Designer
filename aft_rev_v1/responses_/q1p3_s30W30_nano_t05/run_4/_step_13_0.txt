  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while keeping mass under limit.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 16.58 < 30 allowed, total mass 19.03 < 30 max. Load at node_3 fixed at (2,0). Supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Only node_4 can move. Members and areas fixed.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_3 (-16.58), compressive. Member_3 connects node_1 (0,0) and node_3 (2,0). Node_3 fixed. Node_1 fixed. Node_4 position affects force distribution and stress in members connected to it (members 1,2,5). Node_4 currently at (2.5, 2.0). Previous iterations show node_4 moved mostly between (2.3-3.5, 2.0-3.5) with stress fluctuating around 14.6-16.5. Mass is acceptable and low. To reduce max stress, try moving node_4 slightly downward and left to better balance forces and reduce tensile stress in member_3. Area selections seem optimal for current mass and stress levels.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_4 can be moved slightly closer to node_3 horizontally and slightly lower vertically, e.g. (2.3,1.8), to reduce bending moment and redistribute forces. Keep areas same. No new members added to keep closed truss. No node duplication. Check new stress estimate after move.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_3 stress is highest compressive stress. It connects node_1 and node_3 on bottom chord. Moving node_4 closer to node_3 horizontally reduces lever arm of load on node_3, reducing compression in member_3. Lowering node_4 reduces vertical component of forces in members 1 and 2, redistributing stress. Areas are already moderate (3 for members 1 and 2, 2 for others), balancing mass and strength. Total mass well below max, so no need to increase areas. Closed truss maintained with current members.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assuming linear relation of node_4 position and stress, small move left and down reduces max stress. Member lengths recalculated: member_1 length ~ sqrt((2.3-0)^2 + (1.8-0)^2)=~2.92, member_2 length ~ sqrt((6-2.3)^2 + (0-1.8)^2)=~3.89, member_5 length ~ sqrt((2.3-2)^2 + (1.8-0)^2)=~1.81. Mass roughly proportional to length*area. New mass ~ similar or slightly less than current 19.03. Max stress expected to reduce from 16.58 to ~15.5 or lower based on trend.",
  
  "calculation": "Set node_4 to (2.3, 1.8). Members and areas unchanged: member_1 area_id '3' (1.759), member_2 area_id '3' (1.759), others '2' (0.782). Mass approx: member_1 ~ 2.92*1.759=5.14, member_2 ~ 3.89*1.759=6.84, member_3 ~ 2*0.782=1.56, member_4 ~ 4*0.782=3.13, member_5 ~ 1.81*0.782=1.42. Total ~18.09 < 19.03 current, mass reduced. Stress expected max ~15.5 < 16.58 current. Constraints met.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved to (2.3,1.8) reduces max stress and mass. No constraint violations. Load and supports fixed. Members and areas unchanged. Closed truss preserved. Optimization can continue if needed.",
