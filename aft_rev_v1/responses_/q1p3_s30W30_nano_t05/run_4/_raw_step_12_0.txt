Member_3 is short horizontal member between node_1 and node_3 (fixed nodes). Node_4 position affects force distribution in members connecting to it. Current node_4 at (2.35, 2.15) reduced mass and stress compared to prior iterations. Stress in members 4 and 5 are moderate compressive. Areas are fixed as per last design: members 1 and 2 area 3, members 3,4,5 area 2. Further reducing node_4 y-coordinate may reduce compressive stress in member_3 by changing load path, but too low reduces truss height and may increase stress. Moving node_4 slightly right may better balance forces. Small adjustments needed to improve stress distribution and reduce max stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try node_4 closer to (2.5, 1.9-2.0) to reduce max compressive stress on member_3.

Increasing vertical component of force path through node_4 can reduce load on member_3. Moving node_4 slightly right and slightly lower should redistribute forces. Areas are chosen to keep mass low and stress manageable. Member_1 and member_2 with area 3 provide sufficient capacity for tensile forces. Members 4 and 5 area 2 moderate compression. No need to add nodes or members as structure is closed and stable. Load and supports fixed; only node_4 position change allowed.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4 current (2.35, 2.15).
