Members 1 and 2 at area 3 (1.759), members 3,4,5 at area 2 (0.782). Mass is low but stress can be reduced by adjusting node_4 position to better distribute forces. Node_4 currently at (2.75, 2.6). Moving node_4 slightly closer to node_3 and slightly lower may reduce compressive stress in member_3 and balance stresses in members 1 and 2.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Avoid increasing mass by keeping member lengths moderate.

Moving node_4 closer to node_3 horizontally may reduce bending and stress concentration. Keep node_4 within triangle formed by nodes 1,2,3 to maintain stability.
