Load at node_3 fixed; supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Only node_4 can move to improve stress distribution. Members use areas 2 and 3 mostly; consider adjusting node_4 position to reduce stress in member_3 (-15.07) and member_5 (-9.53).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_3 (node_1-node_3) has highest compressive stress (-15.07). Member_5 (node_3-node_4) also high compressive (-9.53). Moving node_4 slightly upward and right may redistribute forces, reducing compression in these members. Keep node_4 inside triangle formed by node_1, node_2, node_3 to maintain closed truss. Member areas are reasonable; no immediate need to change areas. Aim to reduce length of highly stressed members or alter geometry to share load.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on node_4 position shift. Original node_4 at (3.0, 3.0). Try moving node_4 slightly right and upward, e.g., (3.5, 3.5), to reduce compression in member_3 and member_5. Check if this keeps structure stable and does not increase stress elsewhere.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_3 is horizontal at y=0 between node_1(0,0) and node_3(2,0). High compression suggests load transfer through node_4 is suboptimal. Raising node_4 increases vertical component of forces in members 1 and 2, reducing compression in member_3. Slightly increasing horizontal coordinate of node_4 shifts load path. No change to fixed nodes or load/support conditions. Areas remain same to keep mass under limit.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assuming linear elastic behavior, small node_4 position change can reduce member_3 compression. Areas: member_1 and member_2 area_id=3 (1.759), member_3,4,5 area_id=2 (0.782). Total mass estimate remains under 30. Max stress expected to reduce by 10-20%.",\n  \n  "calculation": "New node_4: (3.5, 3.5). Members unchanged. Expect member_3 stress to reduce from -15.07 to ~-12. Member_5 stress to reduce from -9.53 to ~-7.5. Total mass remains ~22. Areas unchanged.
