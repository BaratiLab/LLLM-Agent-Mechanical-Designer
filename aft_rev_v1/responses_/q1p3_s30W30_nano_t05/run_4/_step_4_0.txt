  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress ~14.7 < 30, total mass ~22.7 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved in history to improve stress but still high compressive in member_3.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_3 (node_1-node_3) has highest compressive stress (-14.69). Members connected to node_4 have moderate tensile stress. Node_4 vertical position affects stress distribution. Current design is stable but stress can be further reduced by adjusting node_4 position horizontally and vertically within limits to redistribute forces more evenly. Member areas are fixed mostly (3 for members 1,2; 2 for others).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try shifting node_4 slightly right and slightly down to reduce compression in member_3 and tension in members 1 and 2, keeping node_4 above node_3 to maintain truss integrity. Avoid increasing member lengths excessively to keep mass low.",
  
  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 closer horizontally to node_3 reduces lever arm causing high compression in member_3. Slightly lowering node_4 reduces tension in members 1 and 2 by shortening their length. Keep node_4 above node_3 to maintain triangular geometry and load path. Areas assigned are efficient, no change needed now. This should reduce max stress and keep mass under 30.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_4: (3.0, 3.2). Try new node_4: (2.8, 2.8). Check member lengths and estimate stress reduction. Mass will slightly reduce due to shorter members 1 and 2. Member_3 length unchanged (node_1 to node_3 fixed). Expect compressive stress in member_3 to reduce below 14.5.",
  
  "calculation": "Member lengths: \nmember_1: dist(node_1-node_4) from sqrt((2.8-0)^2+(2.8-0)^2)=3.96 (was 4.0+)\nmember_2: dist(node_2-node_4)=sqrt((6-2.8)^2+(0-2.8)^2)=4.58 (was ~4.27)\nmember_3: fixed length 2.0\nMass estimate: member_1 area 3 * length 3.96=11.88, member_2 area 3 * length 4.58=13.74, member_3 area 2 * length 2=4, others unchanged\nTotal mass ~ 22-23, within limit.\nStress expected to reduce by better force distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 at (2.8, 2.8) expected to reduce max stress below 14.7 and keep mass below 30. No change to node_3, node_1, node_2 due to load/support constraints. Member areas kept same. Structure remains closed triangular truss.",
