Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Area selections fixed. Node_4 moved down and left from previous iterations, stress slightly increased. Need to reduce compressive stress in member_3 (-15.7).",\n\n  "analysis": "Member_3 (node_1-node_3) has highest compressive stress (-15.7). Node_3 fixed at (2,0), node_1 fixed at (0,0). Cannot move these nodes. Adjusting node_4 position affects force distribution in members connected to node_4 and node_3. Moving node_4 closer to node_3 horizontally and slightly lower vertically may help reduce stress in member_3 by better load transfer through members connected to node_4. Also, member areas are fixed, so only node_4 position can be optimized.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try moving node_4 closer to node_3 horizontally from 2.65 to about 2.3-2.4 and slightly lower vertically from 2.4 to about 2.1-2.2. This should reduce lever arm effect and compressive stress in member_3. Mass should remain similar or reduce slightly due to shorter member lengths.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Reducing length and angle of member_3 by moving node_4 closer to node_3 reduces compressive stress. Members 1 and 2 with area 3 (1.759) can handle tensile loads. Member 3 area 2 (0.782) is under high compression; shortening it reduces stress. Node_4 vertical position affects force angles; lowering it slightly should balance forces better. Mass constraint is not tight, so focus on stress reduction.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: member_3 length fixed (node_1-node_3), so stress reduction depends on force redistribution. Moving node_4 horizontally closer to node_3 reduces bending moment on node_3. Member_5 (node_3-node_4) length changes slightly, affecting force path. Area choices kept same for consistency.",\n\n  "calculation": "Set node_4 = (2.35, 2.15). Calculate member lengths: member_1 length ~ sqrt((2.35)^2 + (2.15)^2)=3.18, member_2 length ~ sqrt((6-2.35)^2 + (2.15)^2)=4.11, member_5 length ~ sqrt((2.0-2.35)^2 + (0-2.15)^2)=2.18. Total mass ~ sum(length × area): member_1=3.18×1.759=5.59, member_2=4.11×1.759=7.23, member_3=2.0×0.782=1.564, member_4=4.0×0.782=3.128, member_5=2.18×0.782=1.71; total ~19.24 < 20.17 previous, mass reduced. Expected stress reduction in member_3 due to better load path.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved closer to node_3 and slightly lower, reducing max compressive stress and total mass.
