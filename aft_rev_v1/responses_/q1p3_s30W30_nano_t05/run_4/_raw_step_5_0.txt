Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_4 moved from (3.0,3.2) to (2.8,2.8) reduced mass and stress slightly. Member areas fixed as per iteration 4.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max compressive stress in member_3 (-15.07) dominates. Members 1 and 2 with area 3 (1.759) have moderate tensile stress. Members 4 and 5 with area 2 (0.782) have compressive stresses. Node_4 controls geometry of top triangle, affects force distribution. Moving node_4 closer to node_3 and slightly lower may reduce member_3 stress. Current design is stable with no constraints violated.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider shifting node_4 slightly towards node_3 horizontally and downward vertically to reduce member_3 stress. Avoid large shifts to maintain closed truss and avoid increasing mass. Possibly reduce area of member_1 and member_2 if stress allows, but current stress is low there, so area reduction could risk failure.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_3 has highest compressive stress. Reducing its length or changing angle to reduce axial load can reduce max stress. Node_4 movement affects length and orientation of members 1, 2, and 5. Keeping member areas same but optimizing node_4 position can reduce stress concentration. Current mass is 21.4, room to increase area if needed but better to keep mass low. Load and supports fixed, so no change there.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths and axial forces for members 1,2,3,4,5 with node_4 at (2.7,2.6). Check stress changes.
