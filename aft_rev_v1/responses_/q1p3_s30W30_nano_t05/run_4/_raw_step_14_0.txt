Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_4 movable. Member areas fixed. Goal: reduce max stress further by moving node_4 carefully.",\n\n  "analysis": "Max compressive stress is on member_3 (-16.74), tensile stresses moderate. Member_3 is horizontal member between node_1 and node_3. Node_4 position affects force distribution in diagonal members and hence stress in horizontal members. Moving node_4 closer to line between node_1 and node_2 may reduce bending and stress concentration in member_3.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try lowering node_4 y coordinate slightly and shifting x coordinate near 2.1-2.2 to balance forces better. Avoid increasing member lengths excessively to keep mass low. Member areas fixed, so only geometric optimization possible. Stress reduction expected by improving force path.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 down from (2.3,1.8) to approx (2.1,1.5) may reduce bending moment on member_3 and redistribute forces to diagonals, lowering max stress. This keeps node_4 above node_3 to maintain truss stability and closed geometry. Member lengths remain similar, mass stays under 30. Member connections remain unchanged. Areas remain as before to keep mass low and avoid stress increase in other members.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate approximate length changes: member_1 length from sqrt((2.1-0)^2+(1.5-0)^2)=~2.6 (previous ~2.99), member_2 length ~sqrt((6-2.1)^2+(1.5)^2)=~4.1 (previous ~4.2), member_5 length ~sqrt((2.0-2.1)^2+(0-1.5)^2)=~1.5 (previous ~1.8). Slightly shorter diagonals reduce mass and stress. Horizontal members unchanged length. Expect stress reduction in member_3.",\n\n  "calculation": "Set node_4 = (2.1, 1.5). Keep members and areas unchanged. Expected total mass slightly reduced. Max stress expected to reduce from 16.74 to ~15.5-16.0 based on previous trends. Mass remains ~18 or less. Constraints remain satisfied.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes or members, node_3 and supports fixed. Areas unchanged. Stress and mass within limits.
