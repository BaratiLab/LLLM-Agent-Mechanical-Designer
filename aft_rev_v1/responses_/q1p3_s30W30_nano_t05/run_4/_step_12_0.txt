  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while keeping constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress ~15.63 < 30, total mass ~19.45 < 30; load at node_3 fixed; node_1 and node_2 supports fixed; node_4 movable.",
  
  "analysis": "Max compressive stress is on member_3 (-15.63), tensile stresses are lower. Member_3 is short horizontal member between node_1 and node_3 (fixed nodes). Node_4 position affects force distribution in members connecting to it. Current node_4 at (2.35, 2.15) reduced mass and stress compared to prior iterations. Stress in members 4 and 5 are moderate compressive. Areas are fixed as per last design: members 1 and 2 area 3, members 3,4,5 area 2. Further reducing node_4 y-coordinate may reduce compressive stress in member_3 by changing load path, but too low reduces truss height and may increase stress. Moving node_4 slightly right may better balance forces. Small adjustments needed to improve stress distribution and reduce max stress.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try node_4 closer to (2.5, 1.9-2.0) to reduce max compressive stress on member_3. Keep member areas same as last iteration to keep mass low. Check if stress reduces below 15.6 and mass remains < 20.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_3 is highly stressed in compression. Increasing vertical component of force path through node_4 can reduce load on member_3. Moving node_4 slightly right and slightly lower should redistribute forces. Areas are chosen to keep mass low and stress manageable. Member_1 and member_2 with area 3 provide sufficient capacity for tensile forces. Members 4 and 5 area 2 moderate compression. No need to add nodes or members as structure is closed and stable. Load and supports fixed; only node_4 position change allowed.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4 current (2.35, 2.15). Test (2.5, 2.0) and (2.55, 1.95). Calculate member lengths: member_1 length ~ sqrt((2.5)^2 + (2.0)^2)=3.2016, member_2 length ~ sqrt((6-2.5)^2 + 2.0^2)=3.9051. Mass approx sum(length * area) with area 3 for member_1 and 2, area 2 for others. Should be < 30. Expected stress reduction due to better force path.",
  
  "calculation": "Set node_4 at (2.5, 2.0). Member lengths: m1=3.2016, m2=3.9051, m3=2.0, m4=4.0, m5=2.06 approx. Mass = m1*1.759 + m2*1.759 + m3*0.782 + m4*0.782 + m5*0.782 = (3.2016+3.9051)*1.759 + (2.0+4.0+2.06)*0.782 = 7.1067*1.759 + 8.06*0.782 = 12.5 + 6.3 = 18.8 approx < 20. Stress estimated to reduce max compressive stress by ~0.5 to 1 unit due to better geometry. Tensile stresses remain low. Mass and stress constraints met.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved to (2.5, 2.0) reduces max stress slightly and mass remains under limit. No area changes needed. Further large improvements unlikely with single movable node. Recommend next iteration with this position. Stop optimization if no improvement next step.",
