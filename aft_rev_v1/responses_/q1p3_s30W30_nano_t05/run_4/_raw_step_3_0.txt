Node_4 position affects force distribution in members connected to it (member_1, member_2, member_5). Current node_4 at (3.3,3.0) lowered from previous (3.5,3.5) reduced mass and stress slightly but max stress increased slightly. Need to try repositioning node_4 to reduce compression in member_3 by better load transfer through node_4.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Moving node_4 slightly more towards node_3 horizontally may reduce compressive stress in member_3 by increasing load sharing in member_5 and members 1,2. Also, increasing vertical position of node_4 slightly may improve force distribution. Area assignments seem reasonable, member_3 area=2, members_1,2 area=3, others area=2.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Since node_3 is loaded and fixed, node_4 position controls geometry of truss. Moving node_4 closer to node_3 horizontally may reduce compression on member_3 by increasing force in member_5 and others. Slight increase in height of node_4 may improve force flow. Keep node_4 inside triangle formed by node_1, node_2, and node_3 to maintain closed truss. Areas are fixed currently, no instruction to change. Mass is well below max, so slight increase in member length acceptable if stress reduces.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Try node_4 at (3.0, 3.2) from current (3.3,3.0). This moves node_4 slightly left and up, potentially reducing compression on member_3. Check member lengths and estimate mass impact. Member_1 length ~ sqrt((3.0-0)^2 + (3.2-0)^2)=~4.38, member_2 length ~ sqrt((6-3)^2 + (0-3.2)^2)=~4.0, member_3 length fixed at 2.0, member_4 length fixed at 4.0, member_5 length ~ sqrt((3-2)^2 + (3.2-0)^2)=~3.27.
