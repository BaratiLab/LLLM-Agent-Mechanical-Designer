Load at node_3 = (-10, -45°) means force magnitude 10 at 45° down-left direction. Supports fix reactions at node_1 and node_2. To minimize stress and mass, use a simple triangular truss with minimal member lengths and moderate cross-sectional areas. Use node_4 above the line to form a triangle with node_1 and node_2. Node_3 can be connected to node_4 to transfer load efficiently.
