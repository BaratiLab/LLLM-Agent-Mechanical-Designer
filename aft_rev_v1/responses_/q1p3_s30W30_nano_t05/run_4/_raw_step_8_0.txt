Node_4 moved in previous iterations around (2.6-3.5, 2.3-3.5). Member_3 under highest compressive stress ~-15.3. Members 1,2 use area 3 (1.759), members 3,4,5 area 2 (0.782).

To reduce stress, better distribute load and improve geometry. Node_4 repositioning affects force distribution in members 1,2,5. Increasing height of node_4 can reduce axial forces in bottom chord members by improving triangulation. However, too high increases member lengths and mass. Current mass is well below max 30, so some increase in length is allowed. Area assignments are fixed, so geometry optimization is key. Previous moves oscillated node_4 around (2.6-3.5, 2.3-3.5).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try moving node_4 slightly higher and more right to improve force distribution and reduce max compressive stress in member_3. Avoid increasing mass beyond 30. Keep node_4 inside triangle formed by node_1, node_2, and node_3 to maintain closed truss shape. Check if stress reduces below current 15.3 with feasible mass. If no improvement, stop.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing height of node_4 increases stiffness of diagonal members (1 and 2), reducing load on bottom chord (member_3). Moving node_4 slightly right may balance forces between members 1 and 2. Keep areas as is to avoid mass increase. Node_3 fixed at (2,0), so reposition node_4 around (2.9, 3.0) to reduce compressive stress in member_3. Member lengths and mass increase should be minimal and within constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate approximate member lengths with node_4 at (2.8,2.7) vs (2.9,3.0).

Length member_5: sqrt((2.9-2)^2 + (3.0-0)^2) = ~3.16 (previous ~2.7). Mass increase due to length increase multiplied by area density (area 3 = 1.759).
