  "preamble": "Current truss satisfies constraints with balanced stress and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max stress Â±30, max mass 30. Current max stress ~16, mass ~19 within limits. Load at node_3, supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller).",
  
  "analysis": "The max compressive stress is on member_3 (-15.97), tensile on member_1 (4.08). Mass is well below limit. Node_4 is free to move; recent iterations moved it between (2.1,1.5) and (2.9,3.0). Current position (2.3,2.0) balances stresses and mass. Member areas are chosen as '3' for members 1 and 2, '2' for others, which is reasonable.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further moving node_4 closer to node_3 reduces compressive stress on member_3 but increases stress on others or mass. The current design balances these well.",
  
  "reasoning": "To reduce max stress further, node_4 could move closer to line between node_1 and node_3, but this risks increasing stress on member_1 or mass. Current stresses are well below limits, so further reduction yields diminishing returns. Areas are well chosen to keep mass low while supporting loads. No new members or nodes allowed, so topology fixed.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas imply mass is near minimal for given topology. Stress distribution is balanced. Load direction fixed. Supports fixed. Node_4 position at (2.3,2.0) is optimal compromise.",
  
  "calculation": "Mass = sum(length*area_density) = 19.03 < 30. Max stress = 15.97 < 30. No constraints violated. Moving node_4 closer to node_3 would reduce compressive stress but increase tensile stress and/or mass. Moving node_4 up increases mass and stress. Current design optimal.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met. Further optimization unlikely to improve max stress without increasing mass or violating constraints. Stop optimization.",
