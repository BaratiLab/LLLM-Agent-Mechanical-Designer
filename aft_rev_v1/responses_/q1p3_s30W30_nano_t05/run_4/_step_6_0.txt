  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress ~15.3 < 30, total mass ~20.78 < 30. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_4 movable. Areas fixed per member.",
  
  "analysis": "Max compressive stress is on member_3 (-15.3), tensile stresses on others are lower. Member_3 is horizontal bottom chord from node_1 to node_3. Node_4 location affects force distribution. Previous iterations show node_4 near (2.7, 2.6) yields ~15.3 max stress. Lowering node_4 height slightly may reduce member_3 stress by reducing bending moment. Mass is well below max, so can consider slightly increasing area in critical members if needed.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try moving node_4 slightly lower and closer to node_3 horizontally to reduce compressive stress in member_3. Keep members_1 and 2 area at 3 (1.759) to maintain stiffness. Member_3 area at 2 (0.782) seems adequate. Member_4 and 5 at 2 (0.782).",
  
  "reasoning": "Reducing node_4 height reduces vertical component of force in members_1 and 2, lowering load on member_3. Moving node_4 horizontally closer to node_3 may reduce lever arm and bending stress. Keep node_3 fixed at (2.0,0). Node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_4 new position around (2.6, 2.3) to test. This should reduce max compressive stress and maintain closed truss. Mass should decrease or remain similar.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: m1 = dist(node_1, node_4), m2 = dist(node_2, node_4), m3 = dist(node_1, node_3) = 2.0, m4 = dist(node_2, node_3) = 4.0, m5 = dist(node_3, node_4). Area ids: m1=3, m2=3, m3=2, m4=2, m5=2. Calculate lengths and estimate mass and stress reduction.",
  
  "calculation": "Node_4 at (2.6, 2.3): m1 length ~ sqrt(2.6^2 + 2.3^2) = 3.47, m2 length ~ sqrt((6-2.6)^2 + 2.3^2) = sqrt(3.4^2 + 2.3^2) = 4.07, m5 length ~ sqrt((2.6-2)^2 + 2.3^2) = sqrt(0.36 + 5.29) = 2.36. Mass = sum(length * area) = m1:3.47*1.759=6.1, m2:4.07*1.759=7.16, m3:2*0.782=1.56, m4:4*0.782=3.13, m5:2.36*0.782=1.85. Total mass ~19.8 < 20.78 current, improvement. Expected stress reduction in member_3 due to geometry change.",
