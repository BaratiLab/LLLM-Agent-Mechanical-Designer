  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while keeping mass and constraints valid.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 17.48 < 30 limit, mass 17.76 < 30 limit; load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved down reduces mass but stress increased slightly.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_3 (-17.48), compressive. Members 4 and 5 also high compressive stress. Members 1 and 2 are tensile but lower. Mass is well below limit, so area sizes could be adjusted if needed, but currently areas are fixed. Node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed due to load/support constraints. Node_4 position affects stress distribution. Current node_4 at (2.1, 1.5) is lower and closer to node_3 than prior iterations, reducing mass but increasing stress. To reduce max stress, node_4 should be raised moderately to better triangulate load paths and reduce compression in member_3 and members 4 and 5.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing node_4 y-coordinate slightly may reduce max compressive stress in member_3; may increase mass slightly but still under limit. Avoid going too high to not increase member lengths excessively. Also, adjusting node_4 x-coordinate slightly right could balance forces better.",
  
  "reasoning": "Optimal position of node_4 balances load transfer from node_3 to supports. Raising node_4 increases member_1 and member_2 length, possibly increasing mass but reducing peak stresses. Moving node_4 horizontally closer to mid-span between node_1 and node_2 can symmetrize force paths. Area sizes seem appropriate; no change recommended now. Current max stress is 17.48, well below 30. Further reducing stress below 15 may be difficult without adding members or changing load/supports, which is not allowed.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: member_3 fixed (node_1 to node_3) length = 2.0. Members 1 and 2 length ~ sqrt((2.1)^2 + (1.5)^2) ~ 2.58. Increasing y from 1.5 to ~2.0 increases length to ~3.6. Mass increase acceptable since total mass < 30. Expect stress in member_3 to decrease if node_4 raised, as load path improves.",
  
  "calculation": "Set node_4 to (2.3, 2.0) - moderate raise and slight right shift from current (2.1, 1.5). Member lengths increase slightly: member_1 ~ sqrt(2.3^2 + 2^2) = 3.06, member_2 similar. Mass increase estimated ~1-2 units, total mass ~19, still below 30. Expect max stress to reduce towards ~15-16 based on history trends. Areas remain same.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no constraints violated: max stress < 30, total mass < 30, no node moves on load/support nodes, no duplicate members, closed truss maintained. This design improves stress distribution while maintaining mass and constraints.",
