Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved in history to improve stress but still high compressive in member_3.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_3 (node_1-node_3) has highest compressive stress (-14.69). Members connected to node_4 have moderate tensile stress. Node_4 vertical position affects stress distribution. Current design is stable but stress can be further reduced by adjusting node_4 position horizontally and vertically within limits to redistribute forces more evenly. Member areas are fixed mostly (3 for members 1,2; 2 for others).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try shifting node_4 slightly right and slightly down to reduce compression in member_3 and tension in members 1 and 2, keeping node_4 above node_3 to maintain truss integrity. Avoid increasing member lengths excessively to keep mass low.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 closer horizontally to node_3 reduces lever arm causing high compression in member_3. Slightly lowering node_4 reduces tension in members 1 and 2 by shortening their length. Keep node_4 above node_3 to maintain triangular geometry and load path. Areas assigned are efficient, no change needed now. This should reduce max stress and keep mass under 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_4: (3.0, 3.2). Try new node_4: (2.8, 2.8).
