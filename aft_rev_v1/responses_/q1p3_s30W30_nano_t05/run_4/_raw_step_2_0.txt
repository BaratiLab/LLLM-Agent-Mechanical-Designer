Current mass 23.94 < 30, max stress ±30 allowed. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved from (3.0,3.0) to (3.5,3.5) increased mass and slightly changed stresses.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_3 (node_1-node_3) shows max compressive stress -15.07, close to half allowable limit. Members connected to node_4 have moderate tensile/compressive stresses. Node_4 position affects force distribution. Current design is stable but stress in member_3 is high. Moving node_4 to optimize force path and reduce stress in member_3 is key. Member areas are fixed currently; adjusting node_4 position can reduce stress concentration.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider shifting node_4 slightly right and downward to reduce tension in members 1 and 2 and compressive stress in member_3. Avoid moving load/support nodes. Check if smaller vertical height reduces bending/moment effects.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Max compressive stress in member_3 can be reduced by redistributing load via node_4. Moving node_4 closer to node_3 horizontally and slightly lower vertically will shorten members 1 and 2, reducing their tensile stress and shifting load path. This can reduce compressive stress in member_3. Mass should remain under 30; areas can remain same as current iteration. Member connections are already minimal for closed truss. No duplicate nodes or members.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_4 at (3.5,3.5). Try (3.3,3.0) to reduce height and horizontal distance. Member lengths: node_1-node_4 ~ sqrt((3.3)^2+3^2)=~4.47 vs previous ~4.92, member_2-node_4 ~ sqrt((6-3.3)^2+3^2)=~3.74 vs previous ~3.54, member_3-node_4 unchanged. Expect reduced tensile stress in members 1 and 2, better load distribution.",\n\n  "calculation": "Updated node_4 to (3.3, 3.0). Keep member areas same: member_1 and member_2 area_id \'3\', member_3,4,5 area_id \'2\'. Expect mass slightly reduced or similar to 23.94. Max stress hopefully reduced from 15.07. Members lengths and forces recalculated accordingly.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no node moves on load/support nodes. No duplicate members. Mass < 30. Max stress < ±30.
