This member is horizontal at y=0 from (0,0) to (2,0). Cannot move load/support nodes. Node_4 controls triangle height and affects stress distribution. Current node_4 at (2.6, 2.3). Members connected to node_4 carry moderate stress. Reducing compressive stress on member_3 may require increasing vertical height of node_4 to better distribute forces. Mass is comfortably below limit, so slight increases in member length or area are possible if stress reduces.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing node_4 y-coordinate increases triangle height, reduces bending in bottom chord (member_3). Slightly shifting node_4 horizontally closer to node_3 may balance forces. Areas are currently fixed. Consider keeping areas constant to maintain mass.

Increasing node_4 height reduces compression in bottom chord by increasing load path efficiency. Slight horizontal shift of node_4 closer to node_3 reduces bending moment.
