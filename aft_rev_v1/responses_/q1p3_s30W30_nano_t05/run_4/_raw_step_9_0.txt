Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_4 moved previously between (2.6,2.3) and (3.5,3.5). Member areas fixed. Objective: reduce max stress further by adjusting node_4.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max compressive stress is on member_3 (-14.87), tensile stress max 3.73. Mass is well below limit. Node_4 position affects geometry and force distribution. Previous attempts show node_4 around (2.8-3.0, 2.7-3.0) give stresses ~14.7-15.3. Current (2.9,3.0) yields 14.87 max stress. Slightly lowering node_4 y or shifting x may reduce stress on member_3.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_4 slightly left and down to reduce tension in member_1 and compression in member_3. Ensure no member length or mass increases significantly. Member areas fixed to \'3\' for members 1 and 2, \'2\' for others.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_3 (node_1 to node_3) is under high compression, likely due to load at node_3 and geometry. Adjusting node_4 alters force path. Moving node_4 closer to node_3 horizontally reduces force in member_3 compression. Lowering node_4 y reduces vertical component, possibly lowering stresses. Keep node_4 within triangle formed by nodes 1,2,3 to maintain closed truss and stability.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "New node_4 candidate: x ~2.75 (left from 2.9), y ~2.6 (down from 3.0). Check member lengths, mass, and expected stress trend. Member lengths: member_1 ~ distance(node_1,node_4), member_3 fixed between node_1 and node_3. Areas fixed. Expect slight mass decrease due to shorter member_1 length. Stress on member_3 expected to reduce.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node_4 at (2.75, 2.6): member_1 length ~ sqrt(2.75^2 + 2.6^2) = ~3.78; member_2 length ~ sqrt((6-2.75)^2 + 2.6^2) = ~4.23; member_3 length fixed 2.0; mass roughly sum(length*area). Member_1 mass ~3.78*1.759=6.65; member_2 mass ~4.23*1.759=7.44; total mass ~20.8 (less than current 22.07). Stress likely reduces due to geometry. Member_3 stress expected below current 14.87.
