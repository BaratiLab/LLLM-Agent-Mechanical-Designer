  "preamble": "Optimizing node_4 position to reduce max stress while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress ~15.86 well below Â±30 limit; total mass 19.88 < 30. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_4 moved down and left in last step, stress slightly increased. Need to reduce max compressive stress on member_3 (-15.85).",
  
  "analysis": "Member_3 (node_1-node_3) under highest compressive stress (-15.86). This member is horizontal at y=0 from (0,0) to (2,0). Cannot move load/support nodes. Node_4 controls triangle height and affects stress distribution. Current node_4 at (2.6, 2.3). Members connected to node_4 carry moderate stress. Reducing compressive stress on member_3 may require increasing vertical height of node_4 to better distribute forces. Mass is comfortably below limit, so slight increases in member length or area are possible if stress reduces.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing node_4 y-coordinate increases triangle height, reduces bending in bottom chord (member_3). Slightly shifting node_4 horizontally closer to node_3 may balance forces. Areas are currently fixed. Consider keeping areas constant to maintain mass. Member_3 area=2 (0.782), members 1 and 2 area=3 (1.759).",
  
  "reasoning": "Max stress is compressive in member_3. Increasing node_4 height reduces compression in bottom chord by increasing load path efficiency. Slight horizontal shift of node_4 closer to node_3 reduces bending moment. Keep member areas same to maintain mass below 30. Check if node_4 at approx (2.8, 2.7) reduces max compressive stress below current 15.85. If stress reduces and mass remains <30, accept new design.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Length member_1 = sqrt((2.8-0)^2 + (2.7-0)^2) ~3.89; mass member_1 = length*area = 3.89*1.759=6.84 (previous 6.1). Length member_3 = 2 (fixed). Mass member_3 = 2*0.782=1.564 (unchanged). Total mass ~19.88 + (6.84-6.1)=20.6 approx, still <30. Expected stress reduction in member_3 from improved geometry.",
  
  "calculation": "Set node_4 to (2.8, 2.7). Members unchanged. Areas unchanged. Expect max stress to reduce below 15.85. Mass increases slightly but remains under 30. No change to load/support nodes or member connections.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes/members, constraints met, loads/supports fixed, node positions precise floats, areas from allowed set, mass and stress constraints met.",
