To form a closed truss, add a new node above the x-axis to create a triangular shape. This will ensure stability and distribute load. The load at node_3 is downward-left, so the new node should be placed above node_3 to help carry the load. Members will connect all nodes to form a triangle: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4 plus the base members node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2. Area selection will balance stress and mass. Use simplified static equilibrium and axial stress assumptions.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2.0, h) with h>0.

The base members (node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2) will be mainly in compression or tension depending on load direction. The diagonal members to node_4 will carry axial forces to supports. Using areas from the given discrete set, choose smaller areas on longer members to reduce mass and larger on shorter critical members to keep stress low.
