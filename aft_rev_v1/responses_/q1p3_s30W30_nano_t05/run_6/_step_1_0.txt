  "preamble": "Current truss meets constraints with low max stress and mass near limit.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective is to minimize stress while respecting max stress ±30 and mass ≤30. Current max stress ~7.24 and mass ~28.04, both within limits.",
  
  "analysis": "The structure is a quadrilateral with a diagonal member creating two triangles. Load at node_3 causes member_3 to have max tensile stress. Member areas are moderate, with member_2 largest area 4 (3.128). Stress levels are low, suggesting no immediate need for area increase. Mass is close to max 30 but still under.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing stress further by moving node_4 or changing member areas may not yield significant gains. Node_4 can be slightly adjusted vertically to balance forces, but current stress is already low. Member areas are reasonable for load distribution.",
  
  "reasoning": "Given max stress is only ~7.24 (well below ±30), and mass is near but under 30, further optimization risks increasing mass or stress. Moving node_4 slightly upward might reduce tensile stress in member_3 but could increase compressive stress elsewhere. The current design is efficient and balanced.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas produce mass ~28.04. Stress distribution is balanced with no member overstressed. Load at node_3 is supported well by members connected to supports at node_1 and node_2.",
  
  "calculation": "No significant mass reduction possible without increasing stress. No stress reduction possible without increasing mass or moving load/support nodes (prohibited). Node_4 position (2.0, 3.0) is optimal for load transfer. Areas are appropriate for current forces.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints satisfied, max stress well below limit, mass near limit but acceptable. No better configuration apparent without violating constraints or instructions.",
