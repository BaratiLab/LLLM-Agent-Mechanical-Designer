    "preamble": "Optimize a 2D truss with 3 given nodes, load on node_3, supports on node_1 and node_2, minimizing stress and mass within constraints.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes given: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Load at node_3: -10N at -45°. Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Max stress ±30, max mass 30. Need closed truss (all nodes connected).",
    
    "analysis": "The given nodes are colinear on the x-axis, which cannot form a stable closed truss alone. To form a closed truss, add a new node above the x-axis to create a triangular shape. This will ensure stability and distribute load. The load at node_3 is downward-left, so the new node should be placed above node_3 to help carry the load. Members will connect all nodes to form a triangle: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4 plus the base members node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2. Area selection will balance stress and mass. Use simplified static equilibrium and axial stress assumptions.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2.0, h) with h>0. Connect members: (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), (node_1-node_4), (node_2-node_4), (node_3-node_4). Calculate member lengths, select areas to keep stress ≤30 and mass ≤30. Use tension/compression assumptions from load and geometry.",
    
    "reasoning": "To resist the -10N load at node_3 (-45°), the triangle formed with node_4 above will share the load. The base members (node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2) will be mainly in compression or tension depending on load direction. The diagonal members to node_4 will carry axial forces to supports. Using areas from the given discrete set, choose smaller areas on longer members to reduce mass and larger on shorter critical members to keep stress low. Approximate member forces by static equilibrium at node_3 and node_4. Use truss assumptions: members carry axial forces only, no bending.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) for initial height. Member lengths: base edges 2.0 and 4.0 units; diagonals approx sqrt(3^2 + 2^2) = 3.605. Calculate forces by equilibrium: sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0 at node_3 and node_4. Use F = σ * A, σ max =30. Mass = sum(length * area). Areas chosen to keep σ ≤30 and mass ≤30. Areas selected from given set.",
