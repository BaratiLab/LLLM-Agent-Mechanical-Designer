  "preamble": "Optimize a 2D truss with 3 fixed nodes, one load, two supports, minimizing stress and mass within constraints.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given 3 nodes: node_1 (0,0, pinned), node_2 (6,0, roller), node_3 (2,0, load -10N at -45°). Constraints: max stress ±30, max mass 30. Need closed truss (all nodes connected forming at least one triangle).",
  
  "analysis": "Nodes lie on x-axis. To form a closed truss, add at least one new node above the line to form a triangle. Node_3 is loaded downward-left. Supports at ends. The simplest closed truss is a triangle connecting node_1, node_2, and an additional node above node_3. This distributes load and reduces stress. Use truss members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_2, and add new node_4 above node_3 to form two triangles (node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_3-node_2-node_4). This increases stability and reduces stress in members. Choose areas to keep mass ≤30 and stress ≤30. Approximate member forces using static equilibrium and trigonometry.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2, h), h>0 to form a triangle. Members: (1-3), (3-2), (1-2), (1-4), (3-4), (2-4). Calculate lengths, estimate forces from load and supports, assign areas accordingly. Aim for smaller areas on longer members to minimize mass. Use area_id 2 (0.782) or 3 (1.759) for high force members, smaller for others.",
  
  "reasoning": "1. Node_4 placed vertically above node_3 to form two triangles sharing node_4 and node_3. 2. Load at node_3 is downward-left, so node_4 should be sufficiently high to reduce compression in bottom chord and tension in diagonals. 3. Member lengths calculated by Euclidean distance. 4. Use simple static equilibrium (sum forces in x and y = 0) to estimate member forces. 5. Select member areas from given discrete set to keep stress ≤30 and mass ≤30. 6. Mass = sum(length × area). 7. Stress proportional to force / area, so choose area to keep stress ≤30.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic, pin joints, axial forces only. Calculate member lengths: l_13, l_32, l_12, l_14, l_34, l_24. Use load vector at node_3: magnitude 10N at -45°, components Fx = -10*cos(45°)=-7.07N, Fy = -7.07N. Supports: node_1 pinned (restrains x,y), node_2 roller (restrains y). Solve equilibrium for reactions, then member forces. Approximate forces in members connected to node_3 and node_4. Assign areas to keep stress ≤30. Calculate mass = Σ length * area_id. Iterate h to optimize mass and stress.",
