Max stress ±30, max mass 30. Current max stress 38.28 exceeds limit.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has max compressive stress -38.28 on member_1 (node_1-node_3) exceeding ±30 limit. Total mass 17.87 is within 30 limit. Members with area_id=1 (0.195) have high stress. Larger area needed on high stress members. Geometry is simple triangle plus vertical node_4. Load direction induces high compression on member_1. Member_3 (node_1-node_2) also stressed but within limit.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, increase cross-sectional area on critical members and possibly adjust node_4 position to better distribute forces. Possibly add a member from node_4 to node_2 to create a stiffer triangle and reduce stress on node_1-node_3. Avoid adding nodes at load/support points. Keep node_3 at x=2.0, y=0.0.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Increase area of member_1 from \'1\' to \'3\' to reduce stress. Increase member_3 area to \'2\'. Add a new node_5 at (4.0, 3.0) to form a second upper node, connect node_4 and node_5, node_5 to node_2, and node_3 to node_5 for better load path. Assign areas to new members with moderate values. Keep existing nodes fixed.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing cross-sectional areas on highly stressed members reduces stress. Adding node_5 at (4.0,3.0) forms a two-hinge arch shape, distributing load better and reducing compression on member_1. New members create alternate load paths, reducing stress concentration.
