  "preamble": "Current truss design meets constraints with low max stress and near max mass limit.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective is to minimize stress within max ±30 and mass ≤30. Current max stress ~6.3 is well below limit. Mass ~29.6 is near max allowed. Nodes at load/support fixed except node_5 added to reduce stress.",
  
  "analysis": "The current design added node_5 and members connecting it to node_4, node_2, and node_3, creating a more stable closed truss. Max stress reduced from ~38 to ~6.3, a significant improvement. Mass increased but still within limit. The stress distribution is balanced, no member is near the ±30 limit. Load and support nodes fixed, intermediate nodes positioned to optimize load paths.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further reducing stress would require mass increase or repositioning fixed nodes which is not allowed. Minor nodal adjustments unlikely to yield meaningful stress reduction given current low max stress.",
  
  "reasoning": "The current design effectively distributes loads through additional node and members, reducing peak stress. Mass is close to max allowed, indicating an efficient use of material. The stress in all members is well below allowable stress limits, indicating a safe design. Further optimization risks increasing mass or violating constraints. Hence, current design is near optimal.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress max 6.3 << 30 limit; mass 29.6 < 30 limit. All members have reasonable cross-sectional areas. Load at node_3 is well supported by triangulated members. No member overstressed. No further node moves possible at load/support nodes.",
  
  "calculation": "No calculations needed for further optimization as constraints met with margin. Mass close to limit indicates material efficiency. Stress well below limit indicates no need for larger areas or structural changes. Node_5 positioned to reduce stress in members 9 and 7. No redundant members or nodes detected.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes/connections. Areas selected from given set. Node_1 and node_2 fixed as supports; node_3 fixed as load. Node_4 and node_5 positioned optimally. All constraints met. Stop optimization.",
