The total mass is close to the upper bound but still under 30. Members have areas mostly in mid to high range (3 to 4), supporting moderate loads. The nodal positions for load and supports are fixed as required. The additional nodes (5,6,7) are placed to form a closed truss with good triangulation and load paths. Stress distribution is fairly uniform with no member highly overstressed or underutilized.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Potential small improvements by slight nodal shifts or area reductions might reduce mass but risk increasing stress. Current design shows good compromise between mass and stress. Further optimization likely yields diminishing returns.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Load at node_3 (-10, -45°) induces compressive and tensile stresses distributed across members. Members connecting node_5 and node_6, and node_6 and node_3 have moderate stresses, indicating effective load transfer. Member areas are chosen appropriately to balance stress and mass. Moving internal nodes slightly might reduce mass but risk exceeding stress constraints. Given the current max stress and mass margins, structure is near optimal.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Max stress = 19.96 < 30; Mass = 28.66 < 30. Areas mostly 3 or 4. Nodes 1,2,3 fixed. Members form closed loops. Stress distribution balanced. No members at zero stress indicating good utilization.",\n  \n  "calculation": "No member exceeds ±30 stress limit. Total mass is under 30. Members with highest stress have adequate area (3 or 4). Attempting to reduce member areas or move nodes risks increasing max stress beyond limit or losing closure.
