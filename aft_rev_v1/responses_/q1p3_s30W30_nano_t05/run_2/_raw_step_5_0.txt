Need to reduce stress drastically, redistribute forces, possibly add nodes and optimize members and areas.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has high stress in member_5 (node_4-node_2) and others, indicating poor load path and stress concentration. Members with area 3 (1.759) and 1 (0.195) are insufficient or poorly placed. Node_6 placement and connectivity cause stress spikes. Mass is acceptable but stress far exceeds limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress, increase triangulation, add intermediate nodes to spread load, use larger area members in high load paths, and optimize geometry. Avoid long slender members under tension/compression. Maintain supports and load nodes fixed.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add two intermediate nodes to better distribute forces: node_6 near load node_3 and node_7 near mid-span between node_4 and node_2. Connect nodes to form multiple triangles. Use area IDs 4 (3.128) and 3 (1.759) in critical members, smaller areas (1 or 2) in secondary members. Maintain load/support nodes fixed. Remove member_6 (node_3-node_2) to reduce direct high stress path and redistribute.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_7 near (4.5,1.5) and node_6 near (2.5,1.5) creates better load transfer path from node_3 to supports. Triangulation reduces bending and high stress. Increasing area in main compression/tension members reduces stress. Avoid direct long members under high load.
