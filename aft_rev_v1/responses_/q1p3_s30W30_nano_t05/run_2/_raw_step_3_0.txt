Current design exceeds max stress drastically. Load at node_3 downward-left. Supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller).",\n\n  "analysis": "Current structure has very high stresses (up to 4877) and mass ~10.8. Stress far exceeds ±30 limit. Members with large areas and lengths cause overstress. Node_6 and its connections cause stress concentration. Existing nodes 1,2,3 fixed. Node_4,5,6 added to reduce stress but ineffective. Need simpler, more direct load paths and reduced member forces.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Removing node_6 reduces complexity and stress concentration. Using a triangular truss with nodes 1,2,3 and one or two well-positioned intermediate nodes to distribute load. Use smaller cross-sectional areas to reduce mass but enough to keep stress under limits. Members should form stable triangulation. Load at node_3 downward-left requires strong members between node_3 and supports.",\n\n  "proposal": "Remove node_6. Keep node_5 and node_4. Adjust node_5 position closer to node_3 and node_1 to better transfer load. Connect nodes: node_1-node_5, node_5-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_5-node_4, node_4-node_2. Use area sizes 1 or 2 for members to keep stress low and mass low. This layout forms two triangles sharing node_5, distributing forces effectively.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Triangular truss is stable and efficient. Position node_5 at (1.5,1.5) to balance load transfer from node_3 to supports. Node_4 at (3.5,3.0) for upper chord support. Use smaller areas for longer members to reduce mass. Members from node_3 to node_2 and node_5 to node_3 carry load directly. Members node_1-node_5 and node_4-node_2 help stabilize and carry compression/tension. This reduces max stress and mass.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_5 ~ sqrt((1.5-0)^2+(1.5-0)^2)=2.121, node_5-node_3 ~ sqrt((2-1.5)^2+(0-1.5)^2)=1.58, node_3-node_2=4.0, node_5-node_4 ~ sqrt((3.5-1.5)^2+(3-1.5)^2)=2.5, node_4-node_2 ~ sqrt((6-3.5)^2+(0-3)^2)=3.905. Assign areas 2 for node_1-node_5 and node_5-node_4, area 1 for node_5-node_3 and node_4-node_2, area 2 for node_3-node_2. Calculate mass = sum(length * area). Estimate stresses with reduced areas and triangulation to keep <30.",\n\n  "calculation": "Mass = 2.121*0.782 + 1.58*0.195 + 4*0.782 + 2.5*0.782 + 3.905*0.195 = 1.658 + 0.308 + 3.128 + 1.955 + 0.761 = 7.81 < 30.
