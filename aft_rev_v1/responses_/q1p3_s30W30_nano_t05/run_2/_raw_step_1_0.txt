Current max stress 60.4 > 30, mass 13.37 < 30. Need to reduce stress mainly in member_1.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_1 is overstressed in compression (-60.4). It connects node_1 (support) to node_3 (load). Other members have acceptable stresses. Member_5 has largest area and mass but low stress, indicating inefficient sizing. The truss shape is a simple triangle with a node_4 above the base. Load direction is -10 at 45° down-left at node_3. The structure is likely bending heavily on member_1. To reduce stress, can add intermediate nodes or redistribute members for better load path and reduce length or area in overstressed members. Increase redundancy and triangulation to reduce member forces.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 area=0.195 too small for load; increasing area would increase mass. Instead, add a node between node_1 and node_3 to reduce member length and stress. Also, adjust member areas to balance stresses. Possibly add a vertical node above node_3 to form better triangles and reduce bending in member_1.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (1.0, 1.5) between node_1 and node_4 to create shorter members and better triangulation. Redefine members: node_1-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_5-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_4-node_2. Assign areas to keep stress ≤30 and mass ≤30. Remove member_1 and member_5 from old design. Use smaller areas on longer members and larger on shorter, high-load members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 splits the long member_1 into two shorter members, reducing stress. New triangulation distributes load better. Members connecting to load node_3 get moderate area to handle load. Members on base with supports use smaller areas due to lower stress. This reduces max stress and maintains mass under 30. Areas selected from given discrete set to approximate needed capacity without excess mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_1-node_5 ≈ sqrt(1² + 1.5²) ≈ 1.803, node_5-node_4 ≈ sqrt(2² + 1.5²) ≈ 2.5, node_5-node_3 ≈ sqrt(1² + 1.5²) ≈ 1.803, node_3-node_2 = 4.0, node_4-node_2 ≈ sqrt(3² + 3²) ≈ 4.243. Assign areas: node_1-node_5 area=3 (0.782), node_5-node_4 area=2 (0.195), node_5-node_3 area=3 (0.782), node_3-node_2 area=1 (0.195), node_4-node_2 area=1 (0.195). Calculate total mass = sum(length*area) ≈ (1.803*0.782)+(2.5*0.195)+(1.803*0.782)+(4*0.195)+(4.243*0.195) ≈ 1.41+0.49+1.41+0.78+0.83=4.91 < 30, well below mass limit.
