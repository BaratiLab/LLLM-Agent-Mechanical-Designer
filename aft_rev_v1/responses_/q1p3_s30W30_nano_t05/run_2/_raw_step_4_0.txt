Max stress ±30, max mass 30. Current max stress 53.56 > 30, mass 7.81 < 30. Need to reduce peak tensile stress on member_2 and redistribute forces.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current structure has high tensile stress in member_2 (node_5-node_3) likely due to direct load transfer and limited triangulation. The structure is light but overstressed. Adding more triangulation near node_3 and node_4 can reduce stress. Also, increasing cross-sectional areas strategically can help. Node_5 and node_4 positions can be adjusted slightly to improve force paths, but load/support nodes fixed.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add a new node between node_3 and node_4 to better distribute forces. Add members connecting node_3 to node_4 and new node. Use areas from 0.195 to 3.128 to keep mass low. Maintain triangulation. Avoid overly long members to keep stress low.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add node_6 at (2.8, 1.8) between node_3 and node_4 to form two smaller triangles. Connect node_6 to node_3, node_4, and node_5. Adjust member areas: use area 3 for main load paths, area 1 for secondary. Members: node_1-node_5, node_5-node_6, node_6-node_3, node_6-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_2.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Adding node_6 reduces member lengths under high load, distributes forces, and improves triangulation. This lowers peak tensile stress on node_5-node_3. Using moderate cross-sectional areas balances mass and strength. Keeping node_1 and node_2 fixed respects boundary conditions. The new member connections form stable triangles minimizing bending and stress concentration.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_5 ≈ 2.121, node_5-node_6 ≈ 1.3, node_6-node_3 ≈ 1.2, node_6-node_4 ≈ 1.2, node_4-node_2 ≈ 3.201, node_3-node_2 = 4.0. Assign areas: main load members area 3 (1.759), secondary area 1 (0.195). Estimate mass: sum(length*area) ~ under 15, well below 30. Stress expected to reduce due to shorter members and better triangulation.",\n\n  "calculation": "Mass estimate: (2.121*1.759)+(1.3*0.195)+(1.2*1.759)+(1.2*0.195)+(3.201*0.195)+(4.0*1.759) ≈ 3.73+0.25+2.11+0.23+0.62+7.04=13.98 < 30.
