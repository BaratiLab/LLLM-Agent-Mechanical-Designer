Load at node_3 downward-left. Constraints: max stress ±30, max mass 30. Need closed truss (all nodes connected forming at least one closed loop).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current nodes form a line: node_1(0,0), node_3(2,0), node_2(6,0). A line cannot form closed truss. To close the truss, add at least one node above the baseline to create triangular members. Triangular truss is stable and distributes forces well. Use node_4 above baseline between node_1 and node_2. Connect members to form triangle(s). Choose areas to keep stress and mass within limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (3.0, h) with h > 0. Connect members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4, plus baseline members node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2. This forms two triangles sharing node_4. Calculate member lengths, estimate forces using static equilibrium, then select areas to keep stress <30 and mass <30.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Triangular closed truss is statically determinate and stable. Adding node_4 above baseline at x=3 (midpoint) balances load. Members along baseline carry compression/tension; diagonal members carry shear. Approximate member forces by resolving load at node_3. Use small member areas on baseline to reduce mass, larger areas on diagonals to reduce stress. Verify total mass and max stress. Use member areas from given set.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assume node_4 at (3.0, 3.0).
