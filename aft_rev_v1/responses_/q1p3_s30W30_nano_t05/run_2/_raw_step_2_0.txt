Mass is low (4.9), so we can afford larger cross-sections or additional members for load redistribution. Node_5 added to reduce stress but member_3 still overstressed. Member areas are small (mostly area_id 1 or 2). The load is at node_3, which is on the bottom chord. The truss topology can be improved by adding a vertical or diagonal member to better transfer load from node_3 to supports node_1 and node_2. Node_5 can be repositioned or added nodes to form a stable triangular configuration minimizing bending and high stresses.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max compressive stress, add a vertical member from node_3 upwards to a new node above (e.g., node_6). Connect node_6 to node_4 and node_5 to form stable triangles. Use larger cross-section areas on highly stressed members. Keep load and support nodes fixed. Avoid long slender members causing high stress.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add node_6 at (2.0, 2.0) above node_3. Connect node_3-node_6, node_6-node_4, node_6-node_5. Retain existing nodes and members with adjusted areas. Increase area of members carrying high compressive stress. Remove member_3 (node_5-node_3) to reduce direct high compression. Add member_1 (node_1-node_5) with moderate area. Final members: node_1-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_6, node_6-node_4, node_6-node_5.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Adding node_6 creates a vertical load path from node_3 to upper nodes, distributing compression. Removing the highly stressed member_3 reduces peak stress. Using larger cross-sections on compression members reduces stress. Triangular connectivity ensures stability and efficient force flow. The mass will increase but remain under 30.
