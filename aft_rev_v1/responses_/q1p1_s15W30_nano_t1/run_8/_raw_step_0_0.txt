Area selection discrete from given set.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Node_3 loading causes tension and compression in members. Key: add a node above baseline to form a triangle for closure, distributing load effectively. Optimal shape is a triangular truss with nodes at (0,0), (6,0), and a top node near midpoint above baseline for stiffness and mass efficiency. Member areas chosen to keep stresses ≤15 with minimum mass. Mass approx = sum(length * area_id). Stress approx from simple axial force method: Force = Load projected into members, Stress = Force / Area, Area tied to given area_id values.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Choose node_4 at (3,3.5) (precise float) to form isosceles triangle, use members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4 for closed truss. Select areas starting small, increase for members under larger load. Assume linear static behavior, ignore buckling for simplicity.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Load at node_3 is downward-left; top node (node_4) helps to transfer load diagonally reducing moment. Members from bottom nodes to node_4 carry axial compressive or tensile forces. Area selection balances stress and mass. Use area_id 2 and 3 for members spanning longer distances, smaller areas for shorter members. Member force approximations done via static equilibrium of node_3 forces projections.

Using static equilibrium: Forces in members meeting at node_3 balance load. Members node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2 aligned horizontally, node_3-node_4 diagonal. Approximate force distribution: node_1-node_3 = 5N tension (area_id 2), node_3-node_2=5N compression (area_id 2), node_3-node_4=7N compression (area_id 3).
