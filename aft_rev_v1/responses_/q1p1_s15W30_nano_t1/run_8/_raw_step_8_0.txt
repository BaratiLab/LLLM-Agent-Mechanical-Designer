Current structure mass=33.57, max stress=19.35. Node_3 loaded with -10 N at -45°. Keep node_1 and node_2 fixed, optimize members and added nodes.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design exceeds both constraints: too heavy and max stress is excessive at member_7 (node_11-node_2). Many intermediate nodes and members have low stress or add mass. Some long members use large areas. Need more direct load paths and efficient force flow.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove or relocate node_12 (high mass, less contribution). Introduce a taller single intermediate node for better triangulation, reducing long, heavy members. Reduce member area where stress is low, increase where stress peaks. Simplify topology to reduce mass.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Design with nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0) loaded, add node_10 at (2.5, 3.0) as single intermediate node for truss apex. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_10, node_10-node_3, node_10-node_2. Assign areas minimizing mass but satisfying stress constraints, use mostly area_id \'2\' (0.782) and \'1\' (0.195) except compression elements with higher force using \'3\' or \'4\'.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Shortening members reduces mass and stress due to less bending/moment. Using a single apex node transfers load effectively. Member node_10-node_2 carries compression, node_1-node_10 tension, nodes forming two triangles ensure stability. Smaller cross-sectional area in lower stressed members optimizes mass. Load at node_3 transferred through node_10 reduces peak stress. No need for node_11 and node_12 which add mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0 m; node_3-node_2=4.0 m; node_1-node_10=√(2.5^2+3^2)=3.905 m; node_10-node_3=√(0.5^2+3^2)=3.041 m; node_10-node_2=√(3.5^2+3^2)=4.609 m. Assign areas to keep stress < 15, mass sum below 30.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Approximate member forces given load at node_3 -10 N at -45°. Vertical and horizontal equilibrium at nodes imply forces split between node_10 and direct members.
