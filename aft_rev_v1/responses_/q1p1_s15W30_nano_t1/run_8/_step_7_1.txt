  "preamble": "Optimize truss to satisfy max stress ±15 and total mass ≤30 with given loads and supports.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 downward-left (-10N at 45°). Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current max stress 24.17 >15, mass 18.97 <30. Need stress reduced/eliminated over-limit member_5 (24.17). Current node layout lacks vertical bracing near node_3 and node_11, leading to stress concentrations.",

  "analysis": "Current design has moderate mass but member_5 highly overstressed. Members around top chord (node_10-node_11) small area (1), so area insufficient for stress. Members from node_1 and node_2 to top nodes have moderate areas (2,3) still stresses beyond limits. Member lengths moderate, so increasing cross-sectional area on critical members near node_10-node_11 corridor and adding bracing can spread loads. Position of nodes node_10 and node_11 can be slightly adjusted (within instructions) but load/support nodes fixed. Adding one intermediate vertical node between node_10 and node_11 or adding bracing from node_11 directly to node_1 may reduce stresses.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Member areas (0:1, 1:0.195, 2:0.782, 3:1.759) selected mostly smaller 1-3. Increase area for members with high tensile/compressive stresses near top and middle. Add vertical support node above node_11 to reduce long moment arm. Connect it with node_10, node_11, and node_3 to reduce bending. Keep mass under 30.",

  "proposal": "Add one new node node_12 at (3.5, 3.0). Connect node_12 to node_10, node_11, node_3 with area 2 for stiff bracing. Increase area for member_5 (node_10-node_11) from 1 to 2. Increase area for bottom chords member_1, member_2 from 3 to 4 to reduce stress. Add diagonal member from node_1 to node_11 with area 2 to reinforce left side. Connectivity and nodes: keep existing load/support nodes, add node_12 only. This reduces stress concentrations and maintains compact and efficient geometry.",

  "reasoning": "Higher cross section areas on critical load paths reduce stress by increasing load capacity. Adding node_12 higher above node_11 provides added vertical support and load distribution for the diagonal members spanning node_10-node_11 and node_11-node_3. This reduces bending stress. Diagonal from node_1 to node_11 enhances left side load path and stiffness. The largest member area used is 4 to avoid excessive mass increase. Total length and cross section selection keep mass under 30 while reducing max stress below 15.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approx: node_10-node_11 ~2.0, node_11-node_12 ~1.0, node_10-node_12 ~2.06, node_11-node_3 ~2.236; calculating mass and checking stresses with increased areas. Stress expected proportional inverse to area increase; doubling area halves stress approximately. Adding bracing reduces moment lengths and stress peaks.",

  "calculation": "Existing mass 18.97 + added member masses (e.g., 2* member lengths*area). Members increased from area 1 to 2 doubles mass for that member, small length keeps mass moderate. Added node connections ~3 members of length ~2* area 2 = mass ~3 * 2 * 2 = 12 approx added - total mass ~31; so one member area set to 1 or lower. Lower area for some less critical members from 2 to 1 balances mass (~minus 3). Expected max stress reduced from 24 to below 15 by doubling critical member areas and added bracing.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicates, no moved load/support nodes, all nodes unique. Mass budget met below 30. Max stress expected below ±15 after area and bracing improvements.",
