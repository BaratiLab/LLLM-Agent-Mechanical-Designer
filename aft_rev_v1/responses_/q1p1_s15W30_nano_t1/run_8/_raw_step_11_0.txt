Current max stress 7.42 <<15 and mass ~23 <30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current truss is statically stable, closed, and stress is well below allowed limit. Node_1 and node_2 are fixed supports, nodes under load and supports fixed in place. Inner nodes (node_10, node_13) positioned to optimize load distribution with 8 members connecting nodes in closed loop. Area selections mostly level 2 and 3, resulting in moderate mass and low stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further reductions in stress would require significantly changing geometry or increasing member areas, which increases mass. Current mass is within limits, and stress safety factor is comfortable.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Given constraints and boundary conditions, the current design balances stress and mass well. Node adjustments are limited to nodes other than supports and load. Prior iterations show attempts to reduce stresses but with penalties in mass or higher stresses. Current node positions are well distributed vertically and horizontally to carry loads effectively. Member area selections reflect member force demands with higher area for tension/compression members under larger forces, reducing stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Max stress 7.42 < 15; total mass 22.99 < 30. No stress violations, no mass violation. Margins are good, so no urgent need to relocate nodes or reselect areas. Closing the truss with 8 members forms effective triangular substructures. Reducing max stress further would require complex nonlinear optimization unlikely to yield significantly better results given current design.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths and stresses are consistent: max tensile 7.42, max compressive -7.29. Mass sums match member lengths * area density. Node_10 lowered slightly from previous iteration to 2.7 y from 3.3 reduces member stress. Member area assignments use area 2,3 for main force elements. Modest mass savings possible by reducing some member areas to 1 from 2, but may increase stress, no significant gain expected.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Current structure satisfies constraints with good safety margin and mass well below limit.
