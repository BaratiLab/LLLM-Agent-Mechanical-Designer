Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Max stress far exceeds limit (225 vs 15), total mass low (10.45 < 30). Current design likely unstable or with inefficient force paths causing high stress concentrations.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High max stress in member_3 (node_7-node_8), and large compressive stress in member_7 (node_7-node_4) indicates poor load transfer in upper members. Node_7 and 8 placement at [2.0,2.5] and [4.0,2.5] likely causing long members with concentrated bending or axial stresses. Member areas vary but some with area 1 or 2 are overloaded. Mass is well below limit, so increasing member cross-sectional areas where needed can help, but better to improve geometry to reduce member lengths and redistribute forces better. Current structure lacks triangulation near load node_3 to effectively transfer forces to supports. Additional nodes and members to create triangular bracing near node_3 are needed, while keeping existing support and load nodes fixed. Avoid members that create stress >15 by adjusting topology and areas.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add nodes near load point upwards to create stable triangular truss elements transferring load to supports. Remove members causing high stress by replacing them with more efficient members with better load paths. Use areas ≤2 for most members unless unavoidable. Keep structure lightweight and triangular for stability.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_9 at (3.0, 1.5) between node_3 and node_4 to create multiple triangles. Connect node_9 to nodes: node_3, node_4, node_7 and node_8 to distribute forces evenly. Remove member_3 (node_7-node_8) responsible for very high stress. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_9, node_9-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_7, node_7-node_9, node_9-node_8, node_8-node_4, node_3-node_7, node_8-node_2. Assign areas primarily from small to moderate sizes (area_id 1 or 2) except for critical compression members area 3 or 4 to maintain stress limits.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular bracing reduces bending and distributes axial forces more evenly. Introducing node_9 creates smaller members and more paths to supports, lowering member stresses. Eliminating member_3 (horizonal top chord) reduces high tensile stress path causing failure. Connecting node_3, node_7, node_9 provides shorter paths for load transfer. Areas are optimized to keep stresses below ±15 while total mass remains under 30. The configuration respects fixed node positions for load and supports.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Estimate member lengths: node_3-node_9 ≈ 1.58, node_9-node_4 ≈ 1.58, node_9-node_7 ≈ 1.80, node_9-node_8 ≈ 1.80, node_8-node_4=0.5, etc. Assign area 2 for members with higher axial force, area 1 for others. Sum mass using length*area_factor. Calculate stresses assuming load -10 at node_3 distributed through multi-paths results in less than ±15 stress. Verify no member length excessively long to avoid high stress. Approximate total mass around 20-25, within constraints.
