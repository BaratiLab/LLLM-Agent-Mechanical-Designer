Supports are pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Max stress ±15, max mass 30. Current max stress 77.18 > 15, total mass 4.2 < 30. Need to reduce stress significantly by structural redesign and area changes.",\n  "analysis": "Current design uses 6 members mainly concentrated between nodes_1,3,5,6 with large stress at member_2 (-77.2). The load at node_3 causes excessive stress in member_2 connecting node_3 and node_6. Members 3-5 also exceed ±15 in stress. Area selection is suboptimal; also layout has nodes 4,5,6 forming a complex polygon. Need simpler triangulated structure to distribute forces and reduce peak stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Removing member connections with extreme stress, introducing new nodes to redistribute load path, using multiple triangulated paths from supports to load. Keeping load/support nodes fixed, add nodes vertically aligned with node_3 for load transfer.",\n  "proposal": "Retain pin at node_1 (0,0) and roller at node_2 (6,0), and load at node_3 (2,0). Add two new nodes at (2.0, 2.5) and (4.0, 2.5) to create stable triangles. Members: node_1 to node_3, node_3 to new_node_7(2,2.5), node_7 to new_node_8(4,2.5), node_8 to node_4(4,2), node_4 to node_2, node_1 to node_7, node_7 to node_4, node_3 to node_8, all with appropriate areas selected from set to keep stress <15. This structure creates a triangulated load path with members sharing load more evenly, reducing overstress. Areas chosen progressively with smaller for compression members and moderate for tension.",\n  "reasoning": "Triangulated truss reduces bending moments and distributes axial load effectively. Adding two nodes at y=2.5 increases height from original node_3 base, lowering axial force in any one member. Members from node_7 to node_8 and node_7 to node_4 will transfer forces evenly and reduce peak stresses on critical members. Area selection from list prioritizes minimum cross-section for less stressed members and increased area for members under higher tension/compression but maintaining mass <30. Members directly under heavy compressive load get larger area within limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate approximate member lengths and select areas to keep stress within ±15 MPa. Approximate length calculation: member_1-3 length=2m, 3-7=2.5m, 7-8=2m, 8-4=0.5m, 4-2=2m, 1-7≈2.7m, 7-4≈2.2m, 3-8≈2.5m. Approximate area assignments from set {0:1,1:0.195,...}: Longer compression members = area 2(0.782), shorter tension members smaller area 1(0.195).
