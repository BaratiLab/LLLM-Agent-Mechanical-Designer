Current max stress is 36 >15 (constraint violated). Mass 10.6 <30 (mass OK). Need to reduce max stress, especially compressive member_1 (-36).",\n\n  "analysis": "Current design has a complex arrangement with nodes 7,8,9 forming multiple short members. Max compressive stress on member_1 (node_1-node_3) exceeds limits. Member layout around node_3 produces high stresses. Load transfer path unclear and possibly inefficient, causing high member forces. Minimal mass means heavier members can be used strategically to lower stress. Current shape lacks optimal triangulation and redundant load paths.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Simplify structure to clear direct load path from node_3 load to supports. Add strategic bracing nodes above node_3 to create better force distribution. Use larger areas for critical compression members and moderate areas for tension. Eliminate overlapping/redundant members. Keep node_3 at x=2.0 y=0.0 and add nodes above (x=1.5, y=2.0) and (x=3.5, y=2.0) for better triangulation.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add two nodes ln_10 at (1.5,2.0), ln_11 at (3.5,2.0). Members: node_1-node_3 (area 3), node_3-node_2 (area 3), node_1-ln_10 (area 2), ln_10-node_3 (area 2), ln_10-ln_11 (area 1), ln_11-node_3 (area 2), ln_11-node_2 (area 2). Removes nodes 7,8,9 and associated members. Resulting truss is a stable, triangular geometry with distributed forces avoiding stress peaks.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Direct horizontal base with supports, load at node_3 near midpoint on base. Introduced two bracing nodes above forming two triangles sharing node_3 and base nodes. Using moderate cross sections (area 2~3) for compression members to avoid maldistribution. Light area (1) for horizontal brace ln_10 - ln_11. Avoid sharp force concentrations by spreading load via triangles. Larger area for vertical members reduces stress. Mass remains within 30, stress reduced below 15 by force redistribution.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths and approximate masses. Base length 6; node_1-node_3 length 2.0. Triangles approx 2 to 2.5 lengths. Areas {1:0.195, 2:0.782, 3:1.759}. Approx masses computed as length*area. Sum estimated ~15-20 <30. Stress roughly proportional to load/(area*length) so increased area reduces stress. Symmetric geometric layout ensures force balance.",\n\n  "calculation": "Member lengths and mass estimation: member_1 (node_1-node_3): length=2.0; area=3(1.759); mass=3.518. member_3 (node_3-node_2): length=4.0; area=3; mass=7.036. member_5 (node_1-ln_10): length=2.236; area=2(0.782); mass=1.748. member_6 (ln_10-node_3): length=1.118; area=2; mass=0.875. member_7 (ln_10-ln_11): length=2.0; area=1(0.195); mass=0.39. member_8 (ln_11-node_3): length=1.118; area=2; mass=0.875. member_9 (ln_11-node_2): length=2.236; area=2; mass=1.748.
