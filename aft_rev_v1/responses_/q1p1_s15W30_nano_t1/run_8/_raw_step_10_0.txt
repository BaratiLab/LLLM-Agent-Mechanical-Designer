Member areas mostly low, some stress exceed tensile limit. Load on node_3 creates tension/compression in members connected near node_10 and node_13. The triangular topology from node_1, node_10, node_13, node_3 and node_2 creates high stress concentrations in member_5 connecting node_10-node_13.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress exceedance mainly in member_5. Mass is well below limit, room to increase member area in critical members to reduce stress. Member_5 has smallest area \'1\' (0.195) but high stress 28.6; increasing area will reduce stress but increase mass. Optimize member sizing and consider minor node adjustment to redistribute forces and reduce stress in member_5.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep load/support nodes fixed. Slightly lower node_10 y-position to reduce member_5 length and stress and move node_13 closer to line between node_10-node_3 to balance force distribution. Add member connecting node_13 to node_1 to triangulate and lower stress concentration in member_5. Increase member_5 area from \'1\' to \'2\' (0.782) and adjacent members near node_13 to \'2\' to reduce stress. Keep other member areas mostly in range 2,3.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Lowering node_10 y from 3.3 to ~2.7 reduces member_5 length and associated stress. Moving node_13 slightly left and down closer to node_3 or 10 aligns force paths better. Adding member_13-1 creates additional load path, reduces member_5 stress. Increasing area of member_5 reduces stress directly. Balancing member areas avoids mass increase above 30.
