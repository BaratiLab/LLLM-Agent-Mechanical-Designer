Current max stress ~57 exceeds limit; mass 5.8 under limit. Need redesign or member area changes.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high compressive stress (-57) on member_1 (node_1 to node_3) with small area (0.195). Members connected to node_4 carry tensile stress above limit (up to 31.8). The diagonal member_5 is oversized (area 0.782) carrying -9.4 stress, wasted mass. Nodes 1,2 fixed; node_3 carries load (-10N at -45deg). Node_4 midspan works to reduce deflection, but member stresses too high. Current topology has 5 members; max stress on the shortest bottom chord member_1 is critical. Area increase needed or topology change to reduce stress concentration at node_3. Adding a strategically placed node to create extra bracing can help redistribute forces. Member areas changed from 0.195 (area id 1) to higher as necessary but remain minimal to keep mass <30.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_5 above node_3 to form two triangles sharing the load node with shorter members to reduce stress. Use higher area (like 3.128 or 4.887) for critical members. Trim unneeded large area members. Adjust member connections to avoid redundant members.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (2.0, 5.0) above current node_3 to form two stable triangles: (node_1-node_5-node_3) and (node_2-node_5-node_3). Remove node_4 to simplify topology and reduce stress concentration. Define members as follows: member_1 (node_1-node_3), member_2 (node_3-node_2), member_3 (node_1-node_5), member_4 (node_5-node_2), member_5 (node_5-node_3). Assign areas to keep stresses <= ±15 and mass <30. Choose for long vertical and diagonal members area around 4.887 (id 5), for bottom chords moderate area 3.128 (id 4), for top chord member_5 smaller area (2) or (3).",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing node_4 simplifies load path and reduces high tensile stresses observed previously. Adding node_5 at a height 5 maintains stable triangular structures around load node_3, reducing local member length and thus stress. Area assignments guided by required stress reduction - larger areas on members with higher expected loads, smaller where lower load. Member lengths calculated using Euclidean distance, areas selected so (length × area) sum mass <30. Members chosen to ensure statically determinate truss resisting compression and tension, supporting vertical and horizontal components of applied load and reaction forces at supports (pinned and roller).",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node positions:\\nnode_1=(0,0)\\nnodes_2=(6,0)\\nnode_3=(2,0)\\nnode_5=(2,5)\\nMember lengths:\\nmember_1 (1-3): 2.0 m\\nmember_2 (3-2): 4.0 m\\nmember_3 (1-5): sqrt(2^2+5^2)=5.385 m\\nmember_4 (5-2): sqrt(4^2+5^2)=6.403 m\\nmember_5 (5-3): 5.0 m\\nArea assigned:\\nm1=3.128 (id 4)\\nm2=3.128 (id 4)\\nm3=4.887 (id 5)\\nm4=4.887 (id 5)\\nm5=0.782 (id 2) to reduce mass\\nMass = sum(length × area) ≈ (2 *3.128) + (4*3.128) + (5.385 *4.887)+(6.403*4.887)+(5*0.782)\\n=6.256 +12.512+26.33+31.3+3.91=80.3 too high.
