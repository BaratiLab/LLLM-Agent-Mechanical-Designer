  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss with nodal loads, fixed supports, and stress/mass constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load applied at node_3 (magnitude 10 at -45°), pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Max stress ±15, total mass ≤30.",
  
  "analysis": "Current structure (iteration 9) total mass = 20.51 <30 ok. Max stress = 28.63 >15 (violated) in member_5. Member areas mostly low, some stress exceed tensile limit. Load on node_3 creates tension/compression in members connected near node_10 and node_13. The triangular topology from node_1, node_10, node_13, node_3 and node_2 creates high stress concentrations in member_5 connecting node_10-node_13.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress exceedance mainly in member_5. Mass is well below limit, room to increase member area in critical members to reduce stress. Member_5 has smallest area '1' (0.195) but high stress 28.6; increasing area will reduce stress but increase mass. Optimize member sizing and consider minor node adjustment to redistribute forces and reduce stress in member_5.",
  
  "proposal": "Keep load/support nodes fixed. Slightly lower node_10 y-position to reduce member_5 length and stress and move node_13 closer to line between node_10-node_3 to balance force distribution. Add member connecting node_13 to node_1 to triangulate and lower stress concentration in member_5. Increase member_5 area from '1' to '2' (0.782) and adjacent members near node_13 to '2' to reduce stress. Keep other member areas mostly in range 2,3.",
  
  "reasoning": "Lowering node_10 y from 3.3 to ~2.7 reduces member_5 length and associated stress. Moving node_13 slightly left and down closer to node_3 or 10 aligns force paths better. Adding member_13-1 creates additional load path, reduces member_5 stress. Increasing area of member_5 reduces stress directly. Balancing member areas avoids mass increase above 30. Member lengths recalculated for mass and verification.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member area set used: '1'=0.195, '2'=0.782, '3'=1.759. Member length × area summed for mass. Target mass ≤30. Calculate lengths: member_5 shorter with node_10 at 2.7, node_13 adjusted to ~2.85,1.4 helps reduce length. Member_13-1 length ~ sqrt( (3-0)^2+(1.4-0)^2)=3.24; area '2' mass=~0.782*3.24=2.53. Mass tradeoff acceptable given tolerance.",
  
  "calculation": "Positions: node_10 = (1.7, 2.7); node_13 = (2.85, 1.4), others fixed. Members: member_1 (node_1-node_3), member_2 (node_3-node_2) area '3' (1.759), mass approx 3.5×2=7 (estimate). member_3 (node_1-node_10) len ~ sqrt(1.7^2+2.7^2)=3.2, area '2'=0.78 mass=2.5. member_4 (node_10-node_3) len ~ sqrt((2-1.7)^2+2.7^2)=2.7, area '2'=0.78 mass~2.1. member_5 (node_10-node_13) len ~ sqrt((2.85-1.7)^2+(1.4-2.7)^2)=1.68, area '2'=0.78 mass~1.3 (was area '1' before mass 0.43). member_6 (node_13-node_3) len ~ sqrt((2.85-2)^2 + (1.4-0)^2) = 1.6, area '2' mass~1.25. member_7 (node_13-node_2) len ~ sqrt((6-2.85)^2 + (0-1.4)^2)=3.3 area '2' mass~2.58. New member_8 (node_13-node_1) len 3.24, area '2', mass~2.53",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Total mass approx 7+2.5+2.1+1.3+1.25+2.58+2.53=19.26<30 safe. Increased area in members around node_13 reduce stress in member_5. Added member_8 with proper area to create alternate load path. Slight node shifts reduce lengths and balance forces. Expected max stress ≤15 after reallocation.",
