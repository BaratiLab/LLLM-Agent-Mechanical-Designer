  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to meet stress ±15 and mass ≤30 constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 downward-left at 45°, supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller. Current highest stress member_1 at -50 MPa exceeds limit. Total mass just below 30 but stress too high.",
  
  "analysis": "High compressive stress in member_1 ('node_1'-'node_3', area 0.195) causes failure. Members with largest areas (6 and 7) on diagonals cause excess mass. Member_1 low area causes overstress. Geometry concentrated around node_3 leads to stress concentration. Current geometry has many diagonal members from node_3 causing large compressive force. Instead, reconfigure nodes higher and add a truss triangle to better distribute forces, reduce stress in member_1 by increasing its area or redistributing loads. Relaxing diagonal member area or removing redundancies can reduce mass.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding one intermediate node between node_3 and node_4 to spread load. Use larger area for member_1 to reduce stress. Use smaller areas in less critical members. Remove or reduce redundant members causing high mass and low stress. Keep pinned and roller node positions fixed as per instructions.",
  
  "proposal": "New nodes: add node_6 between node_3 and node_4 in vertical direction to increase height and form stable truss. Members: node_1-node_3 (larger area), node_3-node_6, node_6-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_4-node_2, plus node_1-node_5 for stability. Remove members_6 and 7 from old design causing high mass and low stress. Use area codes: member_1 as 2 (0.782) to reduce stress, others as 1 or 0.195 to reduce mass.",
  
  "reasoning": "Increasing height of truss by adding node_6 increases triangle areas, reducing axial forces on low strength members. Elevating node_6 breaks direct load transfer from node_3 to node_4, decreasing compressive stress on member_1. Picking moderate area for member_1 reduces stress under -15 limit and keeps mass reasonable. Removing two redundant members decreases mass significantly. This configuration balances mass below 30 and stress ≤ 15 MPa.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths, stresses using simplified assumptions: length as Euclidean distance, stress proportional to force/load distribution along members, areas selected to keep stress within ±15. Member length*area summed to check mass <=30. Assuming linear force distribution. Use areas to manage stress and mass trade-off.",
