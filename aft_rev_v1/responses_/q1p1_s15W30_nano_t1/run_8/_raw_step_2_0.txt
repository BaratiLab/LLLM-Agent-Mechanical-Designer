Load at node_3 (-10, -45°). Supports fixed at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Current max stress 36.26 >15, mass 26.4 ≤30. Member_5 overstressed, mass high in members 3 and 4.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current design has heavy members between top node_5 and supports with small cross sections leading to high stress in diagonal member_5. Large top node height (5.0) causes large stresses and mass. Current structure is a triangular truss with one top node. Stress limit exceeded due to tensile stress in member_5 (-36.26). Mass use efficient but stress needs reduction via topology or member sizing.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce height of top node to reduce member lengths and stresses. Add an intermediate node to distribute stresses and shorten members. Increase area on highly stressed members carefully. Optimize member layout to reduce max stress. Keep load/support nodes fixed.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add an intermediate node between node_3 (load) and top node. Lower top node height to around 3.5 from 5. Connect nodes 1 and 3, 3 and 2, top node, intermediate node to form improved truss. Use adequate area sizes to keep stresses <15 while mass ≤30.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Reducing height decreases member lengths, reducing stress and required area. Adding node creates a Warren or Pratt-type arrangement improving force paths to supports. Member areas selected to balance mass and strength: larger areas for high force members, smaller otherwise. Avoid areas too large to keep mass low.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Current high stress member_5 length ~5, stress 36.26. Reducing height to 3.5 reduces length to about 3.7. Adding intermediate node splits forces, reduces peak stress. Areas chosen from given set \'{\'0\': 1, \'1\': 0.195, ..., \'10\':19.548}\'. Calculate lengths and areas, verify stresses by rough proportional scaling.",\n\n  "calculation": "New nodes: node_5 at (2.0, 3.5), node_4 at (4.0, 2.0) intermediate. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_5-node_3, node_4-node_3. Estimate lengths: node1-node3=2, node3-node2=4, node1-node5=4.031, node5-node4=2.236, node4-node2=2.236, node5-node3=1.803, node4-node3=2.236. Assign areas to keep stresses <15: node5-node3 and node4-node3 are shorter but carry more load, assign area 4, others smaller (1 or 2). Calculate mass as sum(length*area) approx 20-25 <30, stresses reduced. Structure statically determinate with suitable geometry.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Structure revised with added intermediate node to reduce member lengths and distribute forces.
