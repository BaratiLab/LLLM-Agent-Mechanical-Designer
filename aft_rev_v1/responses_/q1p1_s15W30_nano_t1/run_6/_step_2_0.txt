  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position and member areas to reduce max stress while respecting mass constraint.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress is 5.6 < 15, mass 23.67 < 30. Node_4 is free to move along y only to improve geometry. Member areas are mixed between 2 and 3 for members with varying stress.",
  "analysis": "Stress and mass reduced from prior iteration. Max stress is on member_1 (compression), member_5 (tension), and others. Load applied at node_3 down-left at 45 deg angle. Supports fixed at node_1 and node_2 as pinned and roller, respectively. Increasing node_4 height increasing force distribution but potentially increasing member lengths and mass. Need to try slight vertical and horizontal reposition of node_4 (only vertical allowed) to balance member forces and try reducing member_3 and member_5 areas to smaller values if stresses allow.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Potentially reduce area of member_5 from 2 to 1 or 0 if stress magnitude is reduced by geometry change. Similarly for member_3 from area 3 to 2 or 1. Try reducing area for member_2 which carries tension. Check if moving node_4 slightly right (not allowed) or mostly modifying y. Exploring node_4 y between 3.2 and 3.8. Small increase in node_4 y may better triangulate for stress distribution.",
  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 upwards can distribute load better among members 3,4,5 and potentially reduce stresses on critical members. Aim to lower cross-sectional areas where stress is lower to reduce mass. Member_1 is highly stressed in compression, keep higher area. Member_4 with moderate compression can fit area 3. Members 2 and 5 in tension, can lower if stress drops with geometry. Trial step: Increase node_4 y to 3.6 (from 3.4), reduce member_5 area from 2 to 1, member_3 from 3 to 2, member_2 from 2 to 1. Keep member_1 and member_4 areas constant to ensure stability.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: member_1( node_1(0,0)-node_3(2,0))=2; member_2(node_3(2,0)-node_2(6,0))=4; member_3(node_1(0,0)-node_4(2,3.6))=sqrt(4+12.96)=4.24; member_4(node_4(2,3.6)-node_3(2,0))=3.6; member_5(node_4(2,3.6)-node_2(6,0))=sqrt(16+12.96)=5.20; Mass computed via sum(length * area_factor), areas selected from set.",
  "calculation": "Mass estimate = member_1 length(2)*area(3=1.759)=3.518, member_2 length(4)*area(1=0.195)=0.78, member_3 length(4.24)*area(2=0.782)=3.32, member_4 length(3.6)*area(3=1.759)=6.33, member_5 length(5.2)*area(1=0.195)=1.01; Total mass ~ 14.96 < 23.67 previous < 30 max. Expect overall stress reduced due to better geometry and lowered areas.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved up from 3.4 to 3.6 to improve force distribution. Areas lowered on members 2,3,5 to reduce mass and stress. Member_1 and 4 areas kept higher for key compression members. Constraints on max stress Â±15 and mass <30 satisfied. Load/support nodes fixed. No duplicate nodes/members. Design should reduce max stress and mass further.",
