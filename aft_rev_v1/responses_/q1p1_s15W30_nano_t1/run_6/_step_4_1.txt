  "preamble": "Current design satisfies constraints with safe stress levels and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress is ~5.57 < 15, mass ~24.64 < 30; structure stable, nodal loads/supports unchanged.",
  "analysis": "Stress distribution is well below limits; adding node_5 improved stress uniformity. Members 5 and 6 show zero stress implying potential to reduce cross-sectional area or even remove, but removal may affect stability. Current member areas and geometry yield balanced forces.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further reducing mass may increase stress. Moving node_4 upward beyond 3.6 unlikely to improve; node_5 well positioned. Areas mostly moderate, no overstressed members.",
  "reasoning": "Maintaining current node locations except for load/support nodes, which cannot change. Member areas chosen to keep structure strong but not overdesigned. Zero stress members likely carry negligible load. Removing or reducing these risks instability.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Max stress 5.57 is acceptable; total mass 24.64 is under limit; no tensions/compressions exceed Â±15. No constraint violations. Optimization gains likely marginal or negative.",
  "calculation": "No changes to nodal positions or member areas performed; current design optimal within constraints. No duplicates, closed truss confirmed.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met; minimal stress and reasonable mass. Stopping iteration.",
