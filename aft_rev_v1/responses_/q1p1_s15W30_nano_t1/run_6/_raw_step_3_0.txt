Current max stress exceeds limit on member_5 with area 1, also mass is low but some areas are small.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current critical stress member_5 (node_4-node_2) is 18.07 >15 tensile. Member_2 stress is also high compressive (-13.43) with area 1, which is minimal area. Reducing stress on member_5 needed. Member length calculation shows node_4-node_2 is long (distance about sqrt((6-2)^2+ (0-3.6)^2) = 4.74). Using a small area on a long member causes high stress. Also member_2 length is 4.0 (node_3-node_2). So increasing area of these members or improving geometry to reduce load or length will help.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing areas on critical members will increase mass but within limit. Another approach is adding an intermediate node to reduce member length and redistribute forces. The structure is a simple four-node truss; adding a node between node_3 and node_2 or node_4 and node_2 could reduce critical stresses. Also, slightly lowering node_4 may not help much, current height is 3.6 better than 3.4 in iteration_1. Will try adding node_5 between node_3 and node_2 to redistribute forces. Also increase area of stressed members to next higher (from 1 to 2 or 3).",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node_5 near the midpoint of node_3 and node_2 to reduce length of member_5 and split it into two members: node_4-node_5 and node_5-node_2. Adjust members accordingly. Increase critical members\' area to reduce stress. Keep pinned and roller fixed.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Splitting the long member_5 into two shorter members reduces member stress by load redistribution. Increasing area reduces stress but increases mass, optimize area selection by favoring slightly larger areas only on critical members. Node_5 placement at (4.0,1.8) - midpoint of node_3 (2,0) and node_2 (6,0) shifted up halfway (since node_4 is at 3.6 height), will better triangulate the load path.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: node_3-node_2=4.0, node_4-node_5 approx sqrt((4-2)^2+(1.8-3.6)^2)= 2.11, node_5-node_2=sqrt((6-4)^2+(0-1.8)^2)=2.12. Splitting the long member into two almost half-length members reduces stress and member axial force. Assign area 3 (1.759) to members that were critical (member_5 originally area 1). Original member_2 was area 1 (0.195), increase to area 2 (0.782) for reduced stress. Others are kept similar or slightly optimised to keep mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Estimate mass: member_5 original length ~4.74 × area 1=4.74×0.195=0.9255. Split into two members total length ~4.22 and assign area 3: mass ~4.22×1.759=7.42 higher but offset by reducing area on other less stressed members. Increasing area 1 to 2 for member_2: length 4 × 0.782 = 3.128. Add members and sum estimated mass <30 feasible. Stress reduced below 15 by lowering force concentration and increasing area.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Final design adds node_5 for force path splitting, critical members area increased, others reduced if possible to maintain mass limit.
