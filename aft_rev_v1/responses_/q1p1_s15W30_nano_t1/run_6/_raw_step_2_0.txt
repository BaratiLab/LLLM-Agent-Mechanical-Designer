Node_4 is free to move along y only to improve geometry. Member areas are mixed between 2 and 3 for members with varying stress.",\n  "analysis": "Stress and mass reduced from prior iteration. Max stress is on member_1 (compression), member_5 (tension), and others. Load applied at node_3 down-left at 45 deg angle. Supports fixed at node_1 and node_2 as pinned and roller, respectively. Increasing node_4 height increasing force distribution but potentially increasing member lengths and mass. Need to try slight vertical and horizontal reposition of node_4 (only vertical allowed) to balance member forces and try reducing member_3 and member_5 areas to smaller values if stresses allow.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Potentially reduce area of member_5 from 2 to 1 or 0 if stress magnitude is reduced by geometry change. Similarly for member_3 from area 3 to 2 or 1. Try reducing area for member_2 which carries tension. Check if moving node_4 slightly right (not allowed) or mostly modifying y. Exploring node_4 y between 3.2 and 3.8. Small increase in node_4 y may better triangulate for stress distribution.",\n  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 upwards can distribute load better among members 3,4,5 and potentially reduce stresses on critical members. Aim to lower cross-sectional areas where stress is lower to reduce mass. Member_1 is highly stressed in compression, keep higher area. Member_4 with moderate compression can fit area 3. Members 2 and 5 in tension, can lower if stress drops with geometry. Trial step: Increase node_4 y to 3.6 (from 3.4), reduce member_5 area from 2 to 1, member_3 from 3 to 2, member_2 from 2 to 1.
