The load at node_3 is downward-left (-10 at 45°); major tension and compression expected in members connected to node_3. We must add one node vertically aligned for stability and closure. Member areas chosen from given set, aiming to minimize mass but keep stress ≤15. Supports at 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller) provide statically determinate boundary.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 above the line near node_3 to form a triangle.
