Total mass 25.08 < 30 limit.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Stress is well below limits; mass margin available. Load and supports fixed. Geometry is fairly simple triangular with diagonal. Area selection mostly in mid-range. Maximum tensile stress at member_3 (9.4), compressive stresses moderate.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further stress reduction may require member area balancing or slight node_4 repositioning, but limited by fixed nodes and closed truss constraint. Small improvements likely marginal.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Since max stress and mass are within constraints with margin, and load/support nodes are fixed, major geometry changes prohibited. Member areas and geometry well balanced to handle load efficiently. Incremental optimization could yield minor gains but likely inconsequential compared to effort.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas consistent with stresses and mass. Member_3 is critical tension member; slightly smaller area might reduce mass but increase stress.
