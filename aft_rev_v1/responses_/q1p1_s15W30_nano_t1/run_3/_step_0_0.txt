  "preamble": "Optimize closed 2D truss at fixed support/load nodes, minimizing stress under constraints.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0). Load -10N at node_3 (-45°). Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Max stress ±15, max mass 30. Need closed truss: all nodes connected forming at least one closed loop.",
  
  "analysis": "Current nodes lie on x-axis: node_3 between node_1 and node_2, all colinear. Colinear truss won't form stable closed loop. Introduce a new node above x-axis for closure without moving existing nodes. Thus four nodes total. Connect members to form triangular closed shape with new node. Cross bracing to reduce stress. Choose member areas balancing mass and stress.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at around x=3.0, y positive to form a triangle with node_1 & node_2. Connect node_3 to node_4 for stability. Members: 1-3, 2-3, 1-4, 2-4, 3-4. Area selection from given discrete choice, start with smaller areas for longer members, higher areas for members under high stress (loaded node connections).",
  
  "reasoning": "Adding node_4 at (3,2.5) gives reasonable height. Members 1-3 and 2-3 horizontal, sharing load at node_3. Diagonals 1-4, 2-4, and 3-4 distribute load, reduce member stress. Assume axial stress under load; simple static equilibrium approximates member forces. Use minimum required area for members with low stress, increment for members with high load transfer. Cross bracing to ensure closed truss to reduce stress. Mass = sum(length × area) ≤30.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths calculated by Euclidean distance. Member forces via static equilibrium: sum forces horizontal & vertical at loaded node and supports. Use truss method simplifications ignoring self-weight. Convert force magnitudes to stress = force/area. Areas from given discrete set chosen to satisfy stress≤15 and minimize mass. Members 1-3 and 2-3 are short, 4-3 diagonal longer. Prioritize area sizes 2 or 3 for loaded members and smaller areas 1 or 0 for others.",
  
  "calculation": "Member lengths:\n 1-3: |(2-0,0-0)|=2.0\n 2-3: |(6-2,0-0)|=4.0\n 1-4: sqrt((3-0)^2+(2.5-0)^2)=3.905\n 2-4: sqrt((6-3)^2+(0-2.5)^2)=3.905\n 3-4: sqrt((3-2)^2+(2.5-0)^2)=2.69\n\nAssumptions:\n - Load at node_3: 10N @ -45° splits into components Fx = -7.07N, Fy = -7.07N\n - Supports fix reactions to counteract loads\n - Member forces approximated to balance these forces\n \nApproximate forces:\n - Horizontal members 1-3 and 2-3 resist horizontal load\n - Diagonals provide vertical support and closure\n\nArea assignment (from given discrete sizes):\n - 1-3 and 2-3: area_id=3 (1.759) for moderate stress\n - 1-4 and 2-4: area_id=2 (0.782) smaller for less loaded members\n - 3-4 diagonal: area_id=4 (3.128) larger to reduce stress from combined load transfer\n\nStress check:\n - Max force estimated ≤15*area to keep stress ≤ 15\n\nMass = sum(length × area):\n M=2*1.759 + 2*3.905*0.782 + 2.69*3.128\n =3.518 + 6.106 + 8.416\n =approximately 18.04 < 30 (constraint met)\n\nAll members connected, closed truss formed with four nodes.\n",
