Need closed truss: all nodes connected forming at least one closed loop.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current nodes lie on x-axis: node_3 between node_1 and node_2, all colinear. Colinear truss won\'t form stable closed loop. Introduce a new node above x-axis for closure without moving existing nodes. Thus four nodes total. Connect members to form triangular closed shape with new node. Cross bracing to reduce stress. Choose member areas balancing mass and stress.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at around x=3.0, y positive to form a triangle with node_1 & node_2. Connect node_3 to node_4 for stability.

Area selection from given discrete choice, start with smaller areas for longer members, higher areas for members under high stress (loaded node connections).",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_4 at (3,2.5) gives reasonable height. Members 1-3 and 2-3 horizontal, sharing load at node_3. Diagonals 1-4, 2-4, and 3-4 distribute load, reduce member stress. Assume axial stress under load; simple static equilibrium approximates member forces. Use minimum required area for members with low stress, increment for members with high load transfer. Cross bracing to ensure closed truss to reduce stress. Mass = sum(length × area) ≤30.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths calculated by Euclidean distance. Member forces via static equilibrium: sum forces horizontal & vertical at loaded node and supports. Use truss method simplifications ignoring self-weight.
