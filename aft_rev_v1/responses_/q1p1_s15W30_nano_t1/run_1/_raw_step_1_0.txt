Member_4 connects node_1 to node_4, area 1, smallest among others. Compression too high. Mass is acceptable. Members at node_3 have moderate stresses but only member_4 violates constraints. Member_4 likely carries main load path to pinned support. Need to reduce stress on member_4 by increasing cross-section area or adding member(s) to redistribute load. Area increase would raise mass significantly; better to add a diagonal member from node_4 to node_3 or between node_4 and support nodes. Current members are asymmetric in area. Also member_1 compression is just over -15 limit (-17.08), so minor modification needed to reduce compressive stresses. Node_4 placement at (4.0, 3.0) is fixed; supports and load nodes fixed. Could add an intermediate node to better triangulate and share loads.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing area on member_4 from 1 (0.195) to 2 (0.782) reduces stress but increases mass. Adding a new node near node_4 to create smaller members and better force distribution. Adding a member from node_4 to node_3 or to node_2 diagonally at higher y coordinate to improve load path. Remove or reduce length of highly stressed members by redesign. Positions of node_3 at (2.0,0) can be adjusted slightly within constraints or add new node near it to offload stresses.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node_5 between node_3 and node_4 vertically above node_3 to better triangulate load path. Connect node_5 to node_3 and node_5 to node_4. Increase area of member_4 moderately to 2. Adjust member areas to reduce max stress under 15 and keep total mass <30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 near (3.0,1.5) creates extra diagonal members forming two triangles between node_1, node_3, node_5, node_4, node_2, improving load path and distributing stresses. Increasing member_4 area to 2 (0.782) helps reduce stress, balanced with new members of area 2. Members connecting node_5 enable load redirection, relieving member_4. Member_1 can keep area 2. Member_3 area adjusted to 1 (0.195) as load reduces. Expected max stress under ±15 with this mesh and typical truss behavior.
