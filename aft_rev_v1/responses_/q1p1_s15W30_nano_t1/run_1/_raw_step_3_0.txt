Node_5 movable.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress at member_1 (-10.69) compressive, other members low stress. Mass usage moderate. Current design is stable but can reduce stress further by shifting node_5 to better align load paths and adjusting member areas. Member_3 has zero stress, can reduce its area to save mass and redistribute stress to decrease member_1 stress.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Shift node_5 slightly closer to node_3 and node_4 to optimize force triangles. Reduce area on member_3 from 3 to 1 or 0.195 to reduce mass and encourage load transfer via members 4 and 7. Slightly increase area on members with moderate stress to reduce stress. Avoid large movements violating node_5 connectivity.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Moving node_5 closer to node_4 (e.g. from (4.0,2.0) to near (3.7,2.3)) shortens members with higher stress. Decreasing member_3 area reduces mass and stress concentration. Area changes: member_3 from \'3\' to \'1\'; members_1 and 7 area at \'2\' and \'3\', kept except member_1 area can be increased if needed to reduce stress. Member_4 and 5 low stress, keep small area for mass efficiency. This results in better stress distribution, lowers max stress and stays under mass limit.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate length changes: node_5 moves from (4.0,2.0) to (3.7,2.3): length member_3 (node_3-node_4) unchanged; member_4 (node_5-node_4) slightly shorter, member_7 (node_5-node_2) slightly longer but balanced. Area mass factors: \'1\' = 0.195, \'3\' = 1.759, so reducing member_3 area from 3 to 1 saves mass (~5.6). Total mass expected ~ 11.3 + saved mass, still below 30. Stress should decrease due to improved geometry and better force path.",\n\n  "calculation": "Set node_5 = (3.7, 2.3). Update member_3 area to \'1\'. Keep member_1 at \'2\', member_7 \'3\', members_4 and 5 at \'1\'. Members connectivity unchanged. Expect max stress to drop below 10. Reduce mass from 16.9 to ~12.5. Check no nodes coincide or violate load/support nodes. Confirm closed structure.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "No duplicate nodes or members. Load node_3 and supports node_1, node_2 fixed.
