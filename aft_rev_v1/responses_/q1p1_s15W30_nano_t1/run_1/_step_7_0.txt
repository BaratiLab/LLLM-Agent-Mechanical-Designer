  "preamble": "Current truss design meets all constraints with low max stress.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints max stress ±15, max mass 30, current max stress 9.98, mass 18.0.",
  "analysis": "Max stress and mass are well within limits. Loads and supports fixed. Nodes for load/support unchanged. Stress uniform and low, no member near limits.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Previous iterations show stress spikes with complex members. Current design simplified and stable.",
  "reasoning": "Further node moves or area adjustments yield minimal stress reduction. Current stress distribution is low and uniform. Mass margin available but not needed to reduce stress further.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress reduced from >60 in iteration 5 to ~10 now, mass stable. Closed truss shape retained with minimal members.",
  "calculation": "Member areas selected to balance small mass and low stress. Node_5 repositioned for force flow. No duplicates in members. Design closed and stable.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints respected, no stress above ±15, mass well below 30. Load on node_3 and supports fixed. No changes to loaded/support nodes. Optimal stress state reached.",
