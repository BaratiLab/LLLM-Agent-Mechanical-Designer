  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss for load at node_3 with stress and mass constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load applied at node_3 downward-left. Supports at node_1 (fixed), node_2 (roller). Constraints: max stress ±15, total mass ≤ 30. Current max stress too high (63.1), mass 18.46 < 30. Need redesign for stress reduction and better force flow.",
  
  "analysis": "High stress on member_4 (node_5-node_7) and member_5 due to inefficient load path and member choice. Current nodes beyond load/support nodes added but node placements and member sizes cause stress concentration. Some members oversized causing mass inefficiency.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on better triangulation to distribute forces evenly, add bracing to reduce max member stress. Remove the small links causing compression stress beyond limit. Adjust members for better load path from load node_3 to supports node_1 and node_2.",
  
  "proposal": "Keep load/support nodes fixed. Remove intermediate nodes node_6 and node_7 to simplify. Add node_5 at more optimal position closer under node_4 but appropriately placed to create stable triangles. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_2, node_5-node_2, node_3-node_4 (to triangulate). Assign moderate areas to members with higher forces, smaller areas to less stressed members. Use area ids mainly 2 and 3 for strength and mass balance.",
  
  "reasoning": "Triangular stabilization is essential. Node_5 placed by interpolation (3.5,1.8) between nodes 3 and 4 vertically reduces bending. Eliminates overstressed members due to excessive eccentricities. Members assigned areas based on length and force history. Removes intermediate nodes causing stress concentrations and makes the truss statically determinate, lowering max stresses.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths, assign materials from given areas. Using simplified statics and previous iteration stresses as guide, redistribute areas for members with highest previous stresses (reduce large area members on low stress, increase on high stress). Check if mass stays under 30. Use node_5 at (3.5,1.8) approx to create good triangles.",
  
  "calculation": "Member lengths approx: (node_1-node_3)=2m, (node_3-node_5)=2.06m, (node_5-node_4)=1.5m, (node_4-node_2)=2.24m, (node_3-node_2)=4m, (node_5-node_2)=2.92m, (node_3-node_4)=3.61m. Assign areas: node_1-node_3:2, node_3-node_5:3, node_5-node_4:1, node_4-node_2:2, node_3-node_2:2, node_5-node_2:3, node_3-node_4:1. Estimated mass sum < 26, max stress < 15 with proper load path via these triangles.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no member duplicates, no nodes overlap, supports unchanged. Load node unchanged. Member areas selected from allowed set. Structure simplified for better stress distribution and mass below limit.",
