    "preamble": "Optimize a closed 2D truss with given nodes, supports, and load minimizing stress and respecting mass and stress constraints.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given 3 nodes: node_1 pinned at (0,0), node_2 roller at (6,0), node_3 loaded at (2,0) with -10 force at -45°. Constraints limit stress ±15 and total mass ≤30 with predefined area options. Node positions fixed for load/support.",
    
    "analysis": "The current 3 nodes are collinear along x-axis: node_1 (0,0), node_3 (2,0), node_2 (6,0). A closed truss requires members forming a loop. Thus, adding at least one more node above or below the x-axis is needed to create a triangle or polygon for closure and stiffness. Load at node_3 is diagonal downward-left, which introduces bending and shear. Supports at ends fix vertical and horizontal reactions.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "To form a closed truss, introduce one node above at (4, 3.0) to create two triangles: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_3-node_4-node_2, forming a trapezoidal shape. This allows better force distribution and reduces stress in members. Use members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4. Select cross-sectional areas aiming to balance stress and mass within constraints.",
    
    "reasoning": "Use static equilibrium to estimate member forces. Assume linear elastic behavior and axial force only. Cross-sectional area selection from provided discrete levels minimizes mass while keeping stress below ±15. Members closest to load get larger area. Mass calculated as sum of (length × area). Stress = force / area, force from equilibrium. Simplify angle calculations using coordinate geometry. ",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumed node_4 at (4.0,3.0) to create non-collinear structure. Members lengths via distance formula. Force equilibrium in x and y for node_3 due to load. Resolve into member axial forces ignoring bending. Calculate minimum area for each member to keep stress ≤15. Sum mass with selected areas. Iterate area selection to meet mass ≤30.",
    
    "calculation": "Members and lengths:\n- node_1-node_3: distance = 2.0 (along x)\n- node_3-node_2: distance = 4.0\n- node_1-node_4: sqrt((4-0)^2 + (3-0)^2) = 5.0\n- node_4-node_2: sqrt((6-4)^2 + (0-3)^2) = sqrt(4+9)=3.6056\n- node_3-node_4: sqrt((4-2)^2 + (3-0)^2) = sqrt(4+9)=3.6056\n\nLoad = -10 at -45° => Fx = -10*cos(45)= -7.07, Fy= -10*sin(45)= -7.07\n\nEquilibrium at node_3 summing forces in x and y considering connected members. Estimated axial forces:\n- node_1-node_3 in tension ~7.07\n- node_3-node_2 in tension ~3.6\n- node_3-node_4 in compression ~7.07 (balancing load)\n\nSelect areas to keep stress ≤15:\n- node_1-node_3: length 2.0, force 7.07 => min area = 7.07/15 =0.4713 => closest area = 0.782 (id '2')\n- node_3-node_2: length 4.0, force 3.6 => area=3.6/15=0.24 => closest=0.782\n- node_3-node_4: length 3.6056, force 7.07 => area=7.07/15=0.4713 => 0.782\n- node_1-node_4 and node_4-node_2 carry less load, assign minimal area 0.195\n\nMass = sum(length × area):\n= 2 *0.782 + 4*0.782 + 3.6056*0.782 + 5*0.195 + 3.6056*0.195\n= (2+4+3.6056)*0.782 + (5+3.6056)*0.195\n= 9.6056*0.782 + 8.6056*0.195\n= 7.51 + 1.68 = 9.19 < 30 -> satisfies mass constraint",
    "scratch_pad_final": "All members connected, closed truss formed with 4 nodes and 5 members in two triangles. Stress and mass constraints satisfied with selected areas. No node positions changed except new node_4 added above to form closure. Loads and supports fixed as required.",
