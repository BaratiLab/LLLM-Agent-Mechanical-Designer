  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss with given load/support, meet stress ±15 and mass <=30 constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 downward-left; supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller; current max stress 40.3>15; total mass 9.19<30.",
  
  "analysis": "Current structure overstressed at member_4 (40.29 >15). Member_4 connects node_1 to node_4, area 1, smallest among others. Compression too high. Mass is acceptable. Members at node_3 have moderate stresses but only member_4 violates constraints. Member_4 likely carries main load path to pinned support. Need to reduce stress on member_4 by increasing cross-section area or adding member(s) to redistribute load. Area increase would raise mass significantly; better to add a diagonal member from node_4 to node_3 or between node_4 and support nodes. Current members are asymmetric in area. Also member_1 compression is just over -15 limit (-17.08), so minor modification needed to reduce compressive stresses. Node_4 placement at (4.0, 3.0) is fixed; supports and load nodes fixed. Could add an intermediate node to better triangulate and share loads.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing area on member_4 from 1 (0.195) to 2 (0.782) reduces stress but increases mass. Adding a new node near node_4 to create smaller members and better force distribution. Adding a member from node_4 to node_3 or to node_2 diagonally at higher y coordinate to improve load path. Remove or reduce length of highly stressed members by redesign. Positions of node_3 at (2.0,0) can be adjusted slightly within constraints or add new node near it to offload stresses.",
  
  "proposal": "Add a new node_5 between node_3 and node_4 vertically above node_3 to better triangulate load path. Connect node_5 to node_3 and node_5 to node_4. Increase area of member_4 moderately to 2. Adjust member areas to reduce max stress under 15 and keep total mass <30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 near (3.0,1.5) creates extra diagonal members forming two triangles between node_1, node_3, node_5, node_4, node_2, improving load path and distributing stresses. Increasing member_4 area to 2 (0.782) helps reduce stress, balanced with new members of area 2. Members connecting node_5 enable load redirection, relieving member_4. Member_1 can keep area 2. Member_3 area adjusted to 1 (0.195) as load reduces. Expected max stress under ±15 with this mesh and typical truss behavior. Mass remains under 30 since original mass was ~9 with smaller areas.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_5 at (3.0, 1.5) splits triangle node_1–node_4–node_3 into two smaller, stiffer triangles: node_1–node_3–node_5 & node_5–node_4–node_3. Member list now 7: m1: 1–3 area 2, m2:3–2 area 2, m3:3–5 area 2, m4:5–4 area 1, m5:4–2 area 1, m6:1–5 area 2, m7:5–2 area 1 (new). This layout reduces forces in member_4 by load distribution with smaller members. Approximate mass: sum(length × area) remains <30.",
  
  "calculation": "Lengths: (1,3) = 2.0, (3,2) =4.0, (3,5) ~1.8, (5,4)=1.5, (4,2)=2.236, (1,5)=3.354, (5,2)=3.162. Mass = Σ length×area:\nm1:2.0×0.782=1.564,\nm2:4.0×0.782=3.128,\nm3:1.8×0.782=1.408,\nm4:1.5×0.195=0.293,\nm5:2.236×0.195=0.436,\nm6:3.354×0.782=2.622,\nm7:3.162×0.195=0.616\nTotal mass ≈ 9.07 < 30.\nExpected max stress < 15 by better load path and member sizes.",
