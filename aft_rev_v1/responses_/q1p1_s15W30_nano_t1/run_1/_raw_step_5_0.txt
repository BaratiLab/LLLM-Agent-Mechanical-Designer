Current max stress around 37 > 15, mass 23.48 < 30. Need to reduce stress and refine topology.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design too stressed in members 4 and 8 with high areas causing localized stress concentration. Adding intermediate nodes made mass high but reduced stress unevenly. Complex internal members carry excess load. Need better load path and stress distribution. Removing noisy members and adding well-placed nodes can help force redistribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on adding nodes between node_3 and node_4 and between node_4 and node_2 to create more triangular stable substructures. Reduce large area members and use moderate areas to balance load paths. Possibly remove member_8 which had max stress 37. Adding diagonal member from node_3 to node_5 close to load to bypass node_4 might help.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove overloaded member_8 (node_5-node_4). Add node_6 at (3.5,1.5) and node_7 at (4.0,1.7) for intermediate support. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_6, node_6-node_5, node_5-node_7, node_7-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_6-node_2, node_3-node_2. Use area ids mostly 2 or 3 for main members and 1 for shorter members. This reduces stress with efficient triangulation. Verify stress ≤ ±15 and total mass ≤ 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular layout transfers load effectively to supports, minimizing bending. Intermediate nodes create shorter members reducing stress and allow smaller cross-sectional areas. Removing high-stress members avoids stress concentration. Area selection balances mass and strength. Load at node_3 transfers via node_6 and node_7 to node_4 and node_2 efficiently.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length and area calculation for mass, stress estimated by reducing large area members and increasing number of intermediate members. Main stress paths follow load from node_3 to supports. Truss stability guaranteed by triangular elements.

Areas: 3 × length times area factor (0.782 or 1.759), masses sum to approx. 27 < 30. Stress reduced by shorter members and distributed load paths.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "No duplicate nodes or members. Load and support nodes fixed. Areas fit given allowed values.
