Current max stress 27 too high, mass 10.4 feasible but members overstressed. Load at node_3 down-left (-10 at 45°). Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 fixed. Existing intermediate nodes used except node_5 may be repositioned.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high stress in member_7 (node_5-node_2) at 27.0 > 15 allowable. Other members mostly under limits. Member_6 high tension (13.5) close to limit but allowed. To reduce max stress, improve load path to supports and share forces better. Member_7 critical, reducing its length or area or load transferred would help. Node_5 at (3, 1.5) possibly causes stress concentration. Consider relocating node_5 upward or split load path better. Main load is at node_3, pulling on supports. Triangulation with well-placed intermediate node is critical. Current mass is moderate, room for slight area adjustments.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on lowering stress in member_7: either increase area or reduce member length. Increasing area increases mass; better to reposition node_5 closer to node_2 to reduce member_7 length. Adding a direct member from node_3 to node_4 or node_2 can cut forces transmitted through node_5-node_2 member. Possibly adding node between node_3 and node_4 or moving node_4 might also help. Remove member_6 (node_1-node_5) to reduce tension route or reposition node_5 closer to supports for load distribution.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Modify node_5 position from (3.0,1.5) to (4.0,2.0) closer to node_4, add member from node_3 to node_4 directly with moderate area, remove member_6 (node_1-node_5). Adjust member areas to reduce stress below limits. This redistributes load from node_3 to node_4 and node_2 more efficiently. Keep all existing load and support nodes fixed. Member areas selected from given discrete set based on force estimates.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "By moving node_5 closer to node_4 and adding a direct member (node_3-node_4), load path is more direct from load node to support node_2 via node_4, reducing stress on indirect member_7. Removing member_6 will simplify structure and reduce unnecessary tension. Using medium area for heavily loaded members reduces stress but keeps mass within limit. Lower stress in critical members ensures constraints met. Member area ids chosen: \'3\' (1.759) or \'4\' (3.128) depending on length and force.
