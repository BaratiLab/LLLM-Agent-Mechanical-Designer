Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Existing nodes: fixed supports and load node positions. Current max stress 44.4 > 15, mass 28.8 < 30. Need stress reduction and possible better area distribution.",\n  "analysis": "Current max stress occurs in member_7 (node_5-node_1) at -44.4, exceeding compression limit. Mass close to limit. Members near or at stress limits indicate insufficient geometry or improper area distribution. Current structure is a single triangle plus chords, with node_5 at (4,2). The force path and load positioning cause large stresses in long compression members. Need better load path, redistribute force, add an intermediate node and triangulate more, reduce area on overstressed members, increase critical ones.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Options: 1) Add a node between node_3 and node_5 for better force triangulation. 2) Adjust node_5 slightly up or left to reduce tension in member_7. 3) Change areas to higher for compression members and moderate for tension. 4) Remove or change members causing high stress. Aim robust triangulation, short members, and efficient load paths.",\n  "proposal": "Add node_6 between node_3 and node_5 at (3.0,1.5) to break long members. Update members to: node_1-node_4 (3), node_4-node_3(2), node_4-node_6(2), node_6-node_5(2), node_5-node_2(3), node_3-node_2(1), node_1-node_3(2), node_6-node_1(1). Assign moderate to high areas on compression members, lower on tension where possible.",\n  "reasoning": "Introducing node_6 shortens long compression members (e.g. node_5-node_1 and 5-4), redistributes stresses, and improves triangulation, reducing max stress. Areas assigned to cap stress at ±15 while minimizing mass increase. Keeping existing load/support nodes fixed, added only one node to control complexity and mass. Using precise positions preserves optimized geometry.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths: node_4-node_3 ~1.7, node_4-node_6 ~0.54, node_6-node_5 ~0.5, node_5-node_2 ~2.0, node_6-node_1 ~3.4, node_1-node_4 ~1.7.

Max stress estimated reduced due to shorter member span and better load distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "No duplicate nodes/members. Supports and load nodes fixed.
