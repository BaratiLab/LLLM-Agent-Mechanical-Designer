Constraints: max stress ±15, max mass 30.",\n    "scratch_pad_1": "Current design overloaded member_1 with stress -60.4 exceeding -15 limit, total mass 21.66 within 30 limit. Load at node_3 downward-left; supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller).",\n    \n    "analysis": "Member_1 from node_1 to node_3 has excessive compressive stress. To reduce stress, I must redistribute load possibly by adding nodes and members to improve load path and reduce length and force in member_1. Existing node_5 placed at (3,3) in iteration 1 but didn\'t reduce max stress adequately. Possibly add a new node above node_3 to create a triangular bracing restoring compressive forces and allowing load sharing. Also refine member cross-sections to balance stress and mass.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Plan: Add node above node_3 say node_4 at (2.0, 2.5), connect node_1, node_2, node_3 to node_4 forming two triangles. Use area codes to reduce mass but keep max stress ≤15. Areas for members carrying high stress will be increased, others kept minimal. Remove member_1 if needed, or reduce its area. Check length calculations and member forces carefully.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 2.5). Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3. Assign areas: reduce area for node_1-node_3, increase area for nodes with higher force. Remove long members with excessive stress if possible.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Adding node above load node introduces vertical load path and achieves triangulation, lowering stress on node_1-node_3 by sharing loads through node_4. Proper area selection in members balances stress and mass. Cross-section areas must be carefully aligned with force demands. Keeping mass <30 and max stress ≤15 demands member area trade-offs.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0 m, node_3-node_2 = 4.0 m, node_1-node_4 = sqrt(2.0²+2.5²)=3.2016 m, node_2-node_4 = sqrt(4.0²+2.5²)=4.71699 m, node_3-node_4=2.5 m.
