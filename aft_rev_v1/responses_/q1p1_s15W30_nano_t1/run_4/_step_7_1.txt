  "preamble": "Optimized truss design with 1 additional node to meet stress and mass constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max stress ±15, max mass ≤30. Load at node_3 (-10 at -45°). Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Current max stress 65.3 >>15, mass 22.36 <30.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design fails stress constraint mainly in member_3 (node_1-node_3) with -65.27 compression. The short horizontal member carries too much load. Members from node_4 to nodes 1,2, and 3 help but not enough. Mass is within limit, so we can increase member areas and add nodes. Adding a node near load point vertically to form a triangular stable shape should reduce member stresses. A vertical member with large area will help reduce horizontal member stress by directing force appropriately.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on increasing stiffness near load node_3 by adding a node above it. Use areas in 1-4 range for balance of mass and strength. Remove direct node_1-node_3 member or reduce its area and rely on triangular paths.",
  
  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (2.0, 1.8) above node_3. Connect node_5 to node_1, node_2, node_3, and node_4. Adjust members:\n- Remove node_1-node_3 member (member_3) to reduce stress concentration.\n- Use higher area (4) for node_1-node_4 and node_4-node_2 to carry load.\n- Use area 3 for new vertical members.\n- Keep small area (1) for node_3-node_2 to maintain support.\nMember connections:\nmember_1: node_1-node_4 area 4\nmember_2: node_4-node_2 area 3\nmember_3: node_4-node_3 area 3\nmember_4: node_4-node_5 area 2\nmember_5: node_5-node_3 area 3\nmember_6: node_5-node_1 area 2\nmember_7: node_5-node_2 area 2\nmember_8: node_3-node_2 area 1\nSupports & loads unchanged.",
  
  "reasoning": "Removing direct node_1-node_3 member transfers load through stiffer triangular paths involving new node_5, reducing stress on horizontal members. Areas are selected to balance mass and strength ensuring stress below ±15. The new node helps distribute load better preventing concentration. Member lengths estimated by nodes position allow mass calculation. Using largest areas on long diagonal members and moderate areas on shorter members optimizes mass-stress tradeoff.",
