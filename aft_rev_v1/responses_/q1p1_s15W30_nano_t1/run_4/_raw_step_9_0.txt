Load is -10 at node_3 at -45°. Supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller). Existing design has node_6 at (2,3).",\n\n  "analysis": "Stress exceeds ±15 mainly in member_2 from node_3 to node_2. Member areas and layout can be optimized. The loaded node_3 is at (2,0) on the base, pinned support at node_1(0,0) and roller at node_2(6,0). Node_6 is at 2,3 with several members. High stress may come from insufficient triangulation or large loads on slender members. Keep supports static and load node static, modify intermediate nodes and members.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Options: Adjust node_6 position to reduce stress concentration, introduce additional node for better load path and triangulation. Aim for stable triangular bracing. Use moderate to smaller area ids for tension members and larger for compression. Avoid overly large areas to reduce mass.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add node_7 at (4.0, 2.0) to improve triangulation and load path. Connect members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_6, node_6-node_7, node_7-node_2, node_3-node_6, node_3-node_7. Areas assigned to keep stress below ±15 and mass ≤30.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Adding node_7 between node_6 and node_2 creates two shorter compression members to spread load. The triangle formed by node_3-node_6-node_7 reinforces loaded node_3 reducing stress concentration. Moderate areas on long compression members reduce mass. Test smaller areas (1 or 2) on tension members. This layout provides multiple load paths distributing forces more evenly.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths in m and area ids from given dictionary. Use length × area to approximate mass. Keep total under 30. Stress is proportional to force/(area×length). Increasing area reduces stress but increases mass. Triangulation reduces forces and thus stress on critical members.
