Constraints max stress ±15, max mass 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design at iteration 5 has excessive compressive stress (~-3770) in member_8 (node_6-node_1) and other members, mass 15.59 < 30 but high stress fails. Prior iterations show stress reduction tradeoff involves simpler topology and careful load path.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Strong compression in member_8 suggests unstable or poorly braced member. Node_6 introduction not effective. Need clearer load path from node_3 load to supports, avoid members with excessive compression by better triangulation.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_6 to simplify. Keep load/support nodes. Add a higher node (node_4) above node_3 between supports to form a stable polygon with triangular braced members to distribute forces. Use members connecting node_1, node_2, node_3, and node_4, and add member from node_4 to node_3. Adjust cross section areas to reduce stresses.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Simplified 4-node trapezoid truss: supports at 0,0 and 6,0; load at 2,0; node_4 at (3,2.5). Members: bottom chord nodes 1-3-2 prevent side sway, vertical node_4 introduces compression/tension balanced paths. Use moderate to large area for longer compression members (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4), smaller areas for tension members to reduce mass. This stable geometry reduces high compression stress by spreading load through vertical and diagonal members.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Consider member lengths and assign areas: node distances 1-3=2, 3-2=4, 1-4 ~2.9, 2-4~3.16, 4-3~2.7.
