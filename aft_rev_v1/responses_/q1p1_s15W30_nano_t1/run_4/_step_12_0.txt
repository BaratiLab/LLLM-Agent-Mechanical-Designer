  "stop": "True",
  "preamble": "Current structure satisfies constraints with low max stress and mass below limit.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress is 10.36 < 15 limit, total mass 28.19 < 30 max. Load on node_3, supports pinned node_1 and roller node_2 fixed. Current design has six nodes with closed truss and multiple triangular substructures.",
  
  "analysis": "The design has balanced stress distribution with tensile and compressive stresses within limits. Node positions except load/support fixed except nodes 6,7,8 adjusted to reduce max stress. Areas assigned mostly 1,2,3 for members balancing strength and mass. Triangular node connections improve stability and reduce stress concentration. Further node movement is limited by maintaining closed geometry and support/load node fixity.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Attempted minor nodal shifts in past iterations resulted in stress reduction but further improvements yield diminishing returns given constraints and current mass near allowed maximum.",
  
  "reasoning": "Maximum stress is well below limits meaning structural safety is ensured. Close-to-limit mass means adding larger areas for reducing stress risks exceeding mass. Members under low stress can not be easily downsized without risking failure. The geometry creates multiple load paths reducing reliance on any single member, optimizing stress distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Verification that max tensile and compressive stress ≤ ±15 MPa. Sum of (length × area) weighted member mass = 28.19 < 30. Triangular elements optimized to distribute forces evenly, avoiding stress spikes seen in earlier iterations.",
  
  "calculation": "Member stresses are balanced, e.g. largest absolute compressive -10.36 MPa in member_2 and tension max about 3.43 MPa in member_3. Cross-sectional area selections correspond to moderate mass. Slight node coordinate adjustments give diminishing improvements in max stress with no violation of constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Structure geometry and member sizing are optimal within constraints. Further optimization unlikely to appreciably reduce max stress or mass without violating constraints or changing supports/loads. Current nodal positions and connectivity provide stable closed truss with efficient load transfer.",
