Current max stress 34.2 > 15; mass 10.59 < 30; need stress reduction primarily. Current structure uses 4 nodes, 6 members, with areas mostly small or zero. Some members under high tension or compression beyond limits.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress exceeds limit on member_2 (34.2 tensile) and member_3 (27 tensile). Members with zero area carry load? May cause improper force distribution. Member 4-6 seem underutilized or causing stress concentrations. Structure is a triangle with a base node in middle causing stress concentrations. To reduce stress, redistribute forces better using more triangulation and ensure no zero area members carrying load.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove zero area members; add node above to create stable triangulation. Position nodes to form a truss with two triangles side-by-side to distribute load. Use only valid area sections. Members closer to load and supports have bigger area; others smaller. Try nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), plus higher node at (3,3) for better load transfer.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (3.0, 3.0). Connect nodes as follows: 1-3, 3-2 base; 1-5, 3-5, 2-5 forming top triangle; 3-4 removed. Areas assigned as: members carrying bending (1-5, 3-5, 2-5) larger area (~3), base members smaller (~1 or 0.195) for mass optimization. Remove zero area members. Resulting truss is statically determinate and triangulated.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Introducing node_5 provides upward reaction path, reduces moment on base. Triangulation ensures proper force flow, reduces peak stress. Eliminating zero area members avoids undefined stress paths. Assigning proper cross-sectional areas balances stress and mass. Load applied at node_3 can be carried through members 3-5 and 3-1/3-2 efficiently.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: 1-3 = 2m, 3-2 = 4m, 1-5 = sqrt(3^2 +3^2) = 4.2426m, 3-5 = sqrt(1^2 + 3^2) = 3.1623m, 2-5 = sqrt(3^2 + 3^2) = 4.2426m. Area choices: base members 1 (0.195), triangle members 3 (1.759). Mass = sum(length*area). Check total mass < 30. Stress expected within limit due to triangulation, distribute load.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Total mass estimate: (2*0.195) + (4*0.195) + (4.2426*1.759)*3 = (0.39 + 0.78) + (4.2426*3*1.759) = 1.17 + 22.39 = 23.56 < 30 acceptable.
