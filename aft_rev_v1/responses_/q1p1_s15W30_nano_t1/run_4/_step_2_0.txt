    "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss with given loads, supports. Constraints: max stress ±15, max mass 30.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Current design overloaded member_1 with stress -60.4 exceeding -15 limit, total mass 21.66 within 30 limit. Load at node_3 downward-left; supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller).",
    
    "analysis": "Member_1 from node_1 to node_3 has excessive compressive stress. To reduce stress, I must redistribute load possibly by adding nodes and members to improve load path and reduce length and force in member_1. Existing node_5 placed at (3,3) in iteration 1 but didn't reduce max stress adequately. Possibly add a new node above node_3 to create a triangular bracing restoring compressive forces and allowing load sharing. Also refine member cross-sections to balance stress and mass.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "Plan: Add node above node_3 say node_4 at (2.0, 2.5), connect node_1, node_2, node_3 to node_4 forming two triangles. Use area codes to reduce mass but keep max stress ≤15. Areas for members carrying high stress will be increased, others kept minimal. Remove member_1 if needed, or reduce its area. Check length calculations and member forces carefully.",
    
    "proposal": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 2.5). Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3. Assign areas: reduce area for node_1-node_3, increase area for nodes with higher force. Remove long members with excessive stress if possible.",
    
    "reasoning": "Adding node above load node introduces vertical load path and achieves triangulation, lowering stress on node_1-node_3 by sharing loads through node_4. Proper area selection in members balances stress and mass. Cross-section areas must be carefully aligned with force demands. Keeping mass <30 and max stress ≤15 demands member area trade-offs.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0 m, node_3-node_2 = 4.0 m, node_1-node_4 = sqrt(2.0²+2.5²)=3.2016 m, node_2-node_4 = sqrt(4.0²+2.5²)=4.71699 m, node_3-node_4=2.5 m. Areas: node_1-node_3 as 0.195 (area 1), node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4 as 3.128 (area 4), node_3-node_4 as 1.759 (area 3), node_3-node_2 as 0.782 (area 2). Calculate mass sum length × area and ensure <30.",
    
    "calculation": "Mass = 2.0*0.195 + 3.2016*3.128 + 4.71699*3.128 + 2.5*1.759 + 4.0*0.782 = 0.39 + 10.02 + 14.74 + 4.397 + 3.128 = 32.675 (slightly >30). Slightly reduce node_2-node_4 area to 1.759 to reduce mass = total ~ 27.3 (acceptable). Stress expected to reduce due to better load sharing via node_4.",
    "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes, no duplicate member connections, supports and loads unchanged. Nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2,2.5). Members: node_1-node_3 (area 1), node_1-node_4 (area 4), node_2-node_4 (area 3), node_3-node_4(area 3), node_3-node_2(area 2).
