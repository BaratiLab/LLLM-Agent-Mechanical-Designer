Need to add members and possibly nodes to form closed stable structure minimizing stress and weight.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Given 3 nodes all on x-axis, node_3 is interior and loaded diagonally. Without adding nodes, members form a line, no closed frame, unstable for lateral load. Closed truss requires additional nodes off axis or at least triangulation. Best to add 1 or 2 nodes above node_3 to form a triangle or trapezoid for stability and load transfer. Minimal member lengths preferred to reduce mass. Support at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller allows some rotation but stabilizes horizontal ends. Aim for simple triangular truss with members: bottom chord (node_1 to node_2), two diagonals (node_1 to top node, node_2 to top node), and vertical or horizontal members if needed. Node_3 can act as vertical support connecting bottom chord to apex node. Use areas from smallest possible to keep mass low yet meet stress limits based on force from load and geometry.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2, 2) above node_3 (2, 0).

Estimate stress assuming axial load paths and equilibrium in 2D. Calculate mass = sum(length * area). Assign areas to keep stress <15. Areas to be minimal to reduce mass but sufficient cross-section so stress is within limits.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Adding node_4 at (2, 2.0) above node_3 creates a triangular frame with node_1 and node_2, enabling load transfer upwards and sideways. Members bottom chord (node_1-2), diagonals (1-4, 4-2), verticals (4-3), and bottom chords (3-1,3-2) create a closed stable network. Load at node_3 is -10 at -45°, decomposed to Fx = -7.07, Fy = -7.07. Forces distribute to supports via truss members. Smallest areas chosen based on estimated stress from member force / area ≤15. Use length*area to compute mass ≤30. Approximate stress by dividing member force (tension or compression from static equilibrium of nodes) by cross section area.
