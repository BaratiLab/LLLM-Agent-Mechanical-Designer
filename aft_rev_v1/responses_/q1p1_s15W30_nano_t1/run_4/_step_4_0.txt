  "preamble": "Optimize truss to satisfy max ±15 stress and mass ≤ 30 with given load and supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load downward-left at node_3, pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current max compressive stress at member_5 is -19.33 > 15 constraint. Mass is close but stress over limit. Need to reduce stress in high load paths.",
  "analysis": "Current structure has stress over limit on member_5 (node_3-node_2) which is in compression. This suggests a need for better load transfer from node_3 to supports. Members near node_3 are undersized or stressed beyond limits. Existing top nodes 4 and 5 add complexity but did not reduce stress sufficiently. Member areas currently range from 1 to 4. Reducing member_5 area caused high stress, increasing area causes mass increase, so optimize geometry and load paths. Geometry can be improved by adding a node closer to node_3 to distribute load and adding diagonal members to improve stiffness.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Add intermediate node above node_3, creating a truss triangle with nodes 1,2,and new position. Use moderate areas for vertical and diagonal members to reduce stress on direct member_5. Avoid oversizing. Remove underutilized members or small tension members to save mass.",
  "proposal": "Add one node above node_3 at around (2.0, 1.7), use members: (node_1 - node_4), (node_4 - node_3), (node_4 - node_5), (node_5 - node_2), (node_3 - node_2), (node_1 - node_3), and (node_5 - node_1) with optimized areas to reduce stress below ±15. Node_4 at (2.0, 1.7), node_5 at (4.0, 2.0). Use area ids mostly 3 (1.759) or 4 (3.128) for compressive members, smaller (1 or 2) for less stressed members.",
  "reasoning": "Key load path is node_3 to supports (node_1 pinned, node_2 roller). Direct member_3-to-2 compression too high. Introducing node_4 above node_3 creates triangular bracing reducing stress on member_3-to-2. Node_5 right of node_4 towards node_2 connects members distributing load further. Members from node_1 to node_4, and node_5 to node_1 provide stability and reduce bending moments. Using moderate areas balances stress and mass. Geometry maximizes vertical force components to minimize direct compressed length and stress.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths calculated: node_1-node_4 ~1.7, node_4-node_3 ~1.7, node_4-node_5 ~2.236, node_5-node_2 ~2.236, node_3-node_2 ~4.0, node_1-node_3=2.0, node_5-node_1 ~ 4.472. Areas selected to keep stresses ≤15 while mass sum ≤30.",
  "calculation": "Member lengths and areas chosen to keep total mass under 30:\nmember_1 (1-4): length ~1.7, area=4 -> mass=1.7*3.128=5.318\nmember_2 (4-3): length~1.7, area=3 -> mass=1.7*1.759=2.99\nmember_3 (4-5): length ~2.236, area=3 -> mass=2.236*1.759=3.933\nmember_4 (5-2): length~2.236, area=4 -> mass=2.236*3.128=7.0\nmember_5 (3-2): length=4.0, area=1 -> mass=4*0.195=0.78\nmember_6 (1-3): length=2.0, area=3 -> mass=2.0*1.759=3.518\nmember_7 (5-1): length=4.472, area=1 -> mass=4.472*0.195=0.872\nTotal Mass approx=24.4 < 30, expected stress distribution improved by triangulated bracing.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All members connected to enable load transfer with triangulation, max stress expected under ±15 by reducing load on long compressed member_5. Mass comfortably below 30. No duplication or unsupported nodes. Nodes at fixed load and support positions kept. New intermediate nodes added and connected to improve load path.",
