Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. Nodes node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Nodes node_6 and node_7 movable. Member areas mostly low to mid range. Goal: reduce stress peaks by slight vertical adjustment of node_6 and node_7, possibly increase some areas carefully to distribute stress better.",\n  "analysis": "Max stress is controlled well under limit, but uneven stress distribution suggests improving geometry and area allocation could reduce peak stresses further. Node_6 at (2,3) and node_7 at (4,2) can be slightly repositioned to improve force flow and reduce stress concentrations. Member areas: member_3 (node_1-node_6) area_id=3; member_4 (node_6-node_7) area_id=2; member_5 (node_7-node_2) area_id=3; member_1 and member_6 have area_id 2, member_2 and member_7 have area_id 1. Increasing area of highly stressed members or shifting geometry for better axial alignment can reduce max stress. Need to keep total mass <=30, current 18.3 is well under limit, can consider increasing area where beneficial.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 stress -13.06, member_2 -12.08, member_3 3.22, member_4 4.49, member_5 1.89, member_6 -8.03, member_7 -5.7. Compression dominated on member_1 and member_2, tension low on others. Slight downward movement of node_6 may reduce compression in member_1 and member_2 by better force path. Node_7 can move slightly right and/or upward to optimize stress in member_4 and member_5 paths. Area increase of member_1 or 2 from area_id=2/1 to 3 or 4 may reduce stress without much mass increase.",\n  "reasoning": "Minimize max stress by balancing geometry and member cross-section. Maintain closed truss with current members. Node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed due to supports and load. Move node_6 down from y=3 to ~2.5 and move node_7 right from x=4 to 4.5 and slightly up to y=2.3 to balance forces better and reduce eccentric loading. Increase area_id of member_1 (node_1-node_3) from 2 to 3 to reduce stress there, and member_4 (node_6-node_7) from 2 to 3 for load path. Keep other areas as is for overall mass control. This should reduce max stress further and remain under mass limit.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node adjustments: node_6 from (2.0, 3.0) → (2.0, 2.5), node_7 from (4.0, 2.0) → (4.5, 2.3).
