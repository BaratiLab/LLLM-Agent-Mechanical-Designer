  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss for max stress ≤ ±15 and mass ≤ 30",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load applied at node_3; supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Constraints tight on max stress and mass. Current iteration 15 structure overshoots stress constraints significantly.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design has max stress ≈ 76.17 (vs ±15 allowed) and total mass ≈ 14.8 (within 30 limit). High stresses are mainly in members 3 and 7, near nodes 13 and 15. Areas for members 3 and 7 (area 2 and 1) likely insufficient for loads. Structure has complex mid nodes close to each other (nodes 13 and 15 at 2.9,1.0 and 3.8,0.9 respectively). Load at node_3 pulls diagonally down-left; compression and tension heavily non-uniform.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Need to reduce max stress by reconfiguring truss. Current node layout induces high stress concentration; too many long slender members. Consider a simpler triangular truss with better load path directly from node_3 load to supports node_1 and node_2. Use stiffer members with larger areas for high load paths and reduce excess slender members.",
  
  "proposal": "Remove nodes 13 and 15. Add one mid node (node_4) above node_3 centrally located to create two triangles: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_4-node_3-node_2. Members connecting node_4 with supports and node_3. Use larger sectional area for main compression/tension paths and smaller where less stressed. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4.",
  
  "reasoning": "This simpler triangular configuration allows better force distribution and reduces stress concentrations. Symmetrical placement of node_4 directs load path from node_3's force evenly to supports. Using larger areas on longer distance members and smaller on short diagonals optimizes mass. Triangular topology is inherently stable and minimal. Reducing nodes reduces redundant members and improves efficiency.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Estimate positions: node_4 at (3.0,1.5) approx center above node_3. All member lengths computed and mass from length × area. Areas selected: main bottom chords area 3 (1.759), diagonals from node_4 area 2 (0.782). Total mass expected below 20. Stress expected under 15 with proper area selection.",
  
  "calculation": "Node positions: node_1 (0.0,0.0), node_2 (6.0,0.0), node_3 (2.0,0.0), node_4 (3.0,1.5). Members: m1 node_1-node_3 area 3, m2 node_3-node_2 area 3, m3 node_1-node_4 area 2, m4 node_2-node_4 area 2, m5 node_3-node_4 area 2. Lengths: L1=2.0, L2=4.0, L3=√[(3-0)^2+(1.5-0)^2]=3.354, L4=√[(6-3)^2+(0-1.5)^2]=3.354, L5=√[(3-2)^2+(1.5-0)^2]=1.803. Masses: m1=2×1.759=3.518, m2=4×1.759=7.036, m3=3.354×0.782=2.623, m4=3.354×0.782=2.623, m5=1.803×0.782=1.410. Total=17.21 <30. Stress redistribution expected below constraint.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Structure simplified, mass under limit, stresses expected under limit due to stiffness increase and better load paths. All supports and loads preserved; existing nodes for load/support unchanged. No duplicate nodes/members. Areas from allowed set. Final design should be validated with FEM, but structurally sound per heuristics and principles.",
