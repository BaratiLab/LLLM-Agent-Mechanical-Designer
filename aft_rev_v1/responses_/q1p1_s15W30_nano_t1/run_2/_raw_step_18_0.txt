Node_1 and node_2 fixed, node_3 at (2,0). Current max stress 16.02 exceeds ±15. Mass 17.05 < 30 okay. Existing members and areas cause overstress in member_3 and -10.6 in member_1.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Existing design has node_4 at (3.2,1.3) with member areas mostly 2 or 3. Max tensile stress 16.02 on member_3 (node_1 to node_4). Stress slightly over limit. Member_1 too highly stressed in compression. Should redistribute forces by adjusting top node height and/or area modification.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increased height of node_4 slightly from 1.3 to ~1.5 can reduce tension in member_3. Increase area of member_3 to area_id \'4\' (3.128) to reduce stress. Slightly increase area of member_1 to 4 (3.128) to reduce compressive stress. Use truss geometry symmetry to reduce bending and leverage compression/tension balance.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep node_1, node_2, and node_3 fixed to preserve boundary/load conditions.

Increasing area of member_1 and member_3 will reduce stress in them as stress ∝ force/area. Keep other members as is to avoid mass increase. Member_2 and member_4 kept at area 3 for good load transfer with reasonable mass. Member_5 kept minimal at 2 as it carries less load.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate length of members to estimate mass: member_1 length = distance(0,0)-(2,0)=2.0; member_3 length=distance(0,0)-(3.2,1.5)=sqrt(3.2²+1.5²)=3.53; member_2 length=distance(2,0)-(6,0)=4; member_4 length=distance(6,0)-(3.2,1.5)=sqrt(2.8²+1.5²)=3.16; member_5 length=distance(2,0)-(3.2,1.5)=sqrt(1.2²+1.5²)=1.92",\n  \n  "calculation": "Mass = sum(member_length * area_coefficient).
