Existing nodes mostly on x-axis with one elevated node_4 and node_5. Max stress far exceeds allowable, mass under limit. Need design with better member force distribution and areas.",\n    "analysis": "High stress on member_2 (node_3-node_5) indicates load path inefficiency. Member_2 area too small (area_id=1). Original structure insufficient. Adding node_5 did not reduce max compressive stress below 15. Current structure has redundant members with 0 stress, suggesting underutilization. Load inclined downward-left should be better transferred through triangular stable geometries and multiple paths between load and supports.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Consider triangular truss using nodes at node_1, node_2, node_3 (load), and introduce two new nodes between node_3 to node_2 and node_3 to node_1 elevated to distribute forces. Use bigger areas on heavily stressed members. Avoid overly long single members. Use members with areas 3 or more for high load paths, smaller for tension-only or less stressed members. Ensure connectivity to transfer load vertically and horizontally.",\n    "proposal": "Add node_5 and node_6 above node_3 towards supports to form efficient triangular load paths. Connect: node_1-node_5, node_5-node_6, node_6-node_2, node_3-node_5, node_3-node_6, node_5-node_2, node_6-node_1 to create stable mesh. Assign larger area (3-5) to vertical and diagonal members under compression/tension, smaller area (1 or 0.195) to longer tension-only members.",\n    "reasoning": "New nodes and members create a stable truss that distributes load at node_3 in two directions towards supports, reducing max stress. Multiple load paths reduce individual member stress. Larger areas on compression/tension members provide strength; smaller areas save mass. Triangular geometry ensures stiffness. Pin and roller supports fixed; nodes moved only for added points, preserving loads/support constraints.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths, estimate stresses assuming linear distribution and conservative sizing. Members from load node to new nodes ~1.5-2.5m. Areas selected from catalog. Total mass estimation below 30 as previous total mass was 13 and new structure slightly extended but uses efficient areas.
