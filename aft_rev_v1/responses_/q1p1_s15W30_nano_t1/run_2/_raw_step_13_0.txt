Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Max stress Â±15, max mass 30. Current design exceeded stress limit severely, especially on members connecting node_11 and node_12 and to node_2. Structure likely unstable or has stress concentration.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High stress members (member_3, member_7) are near newer diagonal members at top chord. The structure needs a more efficient load path to transfer combined compression and tension while limiting size and mass. Current node_11 and node_12 positioning creates nonuniform stress concentration. Load at node_3 is critical; members connected to node_2 must balance force. Current design added nodes to top chord but results in oversized stress and mass increase.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce max stress by better triangulation and shorter members with moderate cross-section. Add one or two well-placed nodes above node_3 to better distribute load and avoid overstressing members on top chord. Use larger areas only where stress peaks, otherwise minimal area. Keep mass under 30 easy by avoiding large high-area members over long lengths.",\n  \n  "proposal": "New design: keep given nodes at node_1, node_2, node_3. Add one new node near (3.2,1.2) to improve force path in upper chord. Connect members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_13, node_13-node_2, node_1-node_13, node_3-node_2 directly to stabilize triangle. Avoid multi-layer chains, keep structure simple, minimal members. Assign area ids: 2 (0.782) or 3 (1.759) for main chords, 1 (0.195) for braces with less stress. This should keep stresses under 15 and mass under 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular structure with well-distributed nodes facilitates force flow. Area ids chosen to limit cross-sectional area to control mass, but enough for stresses. Node_13 placement optimized to distribute load from node_3 to supports efficiently, reducing member stresses. Avoid long slender members with high area to limit mass. Avoid redundant members creating stress concentration.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calc: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_13 (3.2,1.2). Lengths approx node_1-3=2, node_3-13=sqrt((3.2-2)^2+(1.2-0)^2)=sqrt(1.44+1.44)=~1.7, node_13-2=sqrt((6-3.2)^2+1.2^2)=sqrt(7.84+1.44)=~3.1, node_1-13=~3.65, node_3-2=4.0. Areas mostly 2 or 3: moderate area for main chords, smaller for diagonals. Estimate total mass: sum(length*area) approx (2*1.759)+(1.7*0.782)+(3.1*1.759)+(3.65*0.782)+(4*0.195)=3.518+1.33+5.46+2.85+0.78=~13.9 well under 30. Stress should reduce due to fewer members but efficient triangulation.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Max stress expected < 15 due to small member length and moderate areas. Member mass sum ~14.
