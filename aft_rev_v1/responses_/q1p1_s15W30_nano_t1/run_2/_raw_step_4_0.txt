Max stress ±15, max mass 30. Previous design stress slightly above limit.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has max stress -15.5 (slightly above allowable -15) and total mass 11.55 (well within 30). Members near max stress are member_1 and member_5. Member areas mostly small-medium. Structure has four nodes including load/support nodes.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress slightly, increase area of critical members or enhance load path with added intermediate node to distribute forces better, without increasing mass beyond 30. Avoid duplicating members. Current mass is low, so can increase some sections.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add one intermediate node elevated between node_3 and node_2 to create a triangular load path for better force distribution. Increase areas of highly stressed members member_1 and member_5. Maintain supports and load nodes fixed. Recalculate members accordingly.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_8 between node_3 and node_2 at (4.0, 1.0) forms two triangles: node_3-node_8-node_7 and node_8-node_7-node_2 (with node_1 as base). This provides better force distribution and reduces stress. Using larger area (4) on members joining to node_3 and node_2, and moderate area (2 or 3) on others balances stress and mass. Keep mass under 30 by careful choice of areas.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Areas lookup: 0=1,1=0.195,2=0.782,3=1.759,4=3.128.
