Current max stress ~10.27 is OK but mass 30.32 slightly exceeds limit. Load is -10 at node_3 at -45°. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller).",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_9(3.5,1.5). Members connect these nodes with various cross sections. Mass slightly exceeds limit mainly due to large cross-section areas (3,4) on diagonals. Max stress location is member_1 (-10.27), within constraint. Structure roughly a triangular bracing with base member_5 from node_3 to node_2. Member_4 from node_1 to node_9 has large area 4 (3.128 area) causing high mass. Current layout inefficiently distributes forces causing mass overshoot.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce number or cross-section sizes of heavy members; adjust node_9 position to reduce member lengths while maintaining equilibrium and load path; possibly add an additional node for better load transfer with smaller members and areas. Triangular topology near load often efficient.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Use nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0) fixed. Add node_9 at (3.0,1.2) (lower and closer to node_3 and node_2) to reduce member lengths. Connect members: (node_1-node_3) area 2 (0.782), (node_3-node_9) area 2 (0.782), (node_9-node_2) area 2 (0.782), (node_1-node_9) area 1 (0.195), (node_3-node_2) area 1 (0.195). This reduces heavy area use, shorter diagonals, and maintains stable truss geometry.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Member areas chosen progressively smaller to reduce mass. Nodes repositioned to shorten diagonal lengths and reduce member mass while maintaining load path and force flow. Smaller cross-section on baselines and heavier diagonals for tension/compression effective. Reduced area on longest diagonal from 4 to 2 or 1 lowers mass. Position node_9 lower to reduce lengths of node_1-node_9 and node_9-node_2 members. Member_5 kept for horizontal support from load node to roller. This creates a simple, stable, and light truss with all stresses expected below ±15.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate approximate lengths and estimate mass:\\nnode_1-node_3: length=2.0 m, area 2-> mass ~ 2 * 0.782=1.564\\nnode_3-node_9: length= sqrt((3-2)^2 + (1.2-0)^2)= sqrt(1+1.44)= 1.562, area 2-> mass ~1.562*0.782=1.221\\nnode_9-node_2: length= sqrt((6-3)^2+ (0-1.2)^2)= sqrt(9+1.44)=3.20, area 2-> mass ~3.20*0.782=2.50\\nnode_1-node_9: length= sqrt((3-0)^2+(1.2-0)^2)= sqrt(9+1.44)=3.20, area 1->mass=3.20*0.195=0.624\\nnode_3-node_2: length=4m, area 1->mass=4*0.195=0.78\\nTotal estimated mass ≈ 6.68 << 30 max, well under limit.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Max stress expected well below 15 with these smaller area members due to smaller loads redistributed.
