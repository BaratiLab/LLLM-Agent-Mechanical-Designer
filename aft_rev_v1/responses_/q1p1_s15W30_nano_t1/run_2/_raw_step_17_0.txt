Nodes 1,2 fixed due to supports and loads. Adjust node_4 (3.0,1.5). Members areas mostly type \'2\' and \'3\'.

The geometry forms a triangle with a midside node_4 creating small top triangle. Mass is within limit. By moving node_4 slightly lower and a bit right, can reduce high tension and compression by changing member angles, improving force distribution.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Test moving node_4 down from 1.5 to ~1.3 and right from 3.0 to ~3.2. This reduces vertical component in members connected to node_4 and balances axial forces better. Keep node_4 within triangle formed by node_1, node_3, node_2 to maintain closed topology.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Lowering node_4 decreases vertical projection of members with high tension and compression, spreading load more through member_4 (node_2-node_4) and member_1 (node_1-node_3). Small horizontal shift might also redistribute forces to reduce stress peaks.
