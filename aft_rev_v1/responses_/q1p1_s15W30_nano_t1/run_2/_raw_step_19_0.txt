Node positions hold fixed supports and load node fixed; internal node4 positioned optimally. Member areas chosen to balance mass and stress. Stress distribution is balanced. Minor stress reduction unlikely without increasing mass or violating constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further lowering max stress from 11.58 to closer to 0 would likely increase mass or require topology changes, which is against instructions. Load and support nodes fixed, node4 well positioned in geometry to reduce stress concentration.",\n  "reasoning": "Given that supports are at nodes 1 and 2 (fixed), and load at node 3, internal node 4 at (3.2,1.5) creates a balanced triangular truss. Areas are selected close to mid-range (2,3,4 area ids) distributing load effectively, limiting max stress. Mass under limit, so design is efficient. Moving node_4 or changing areas may not improve stress significantly without mass penalty or constraint violation.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths roughly: m1 ~3.2 m, m2 ~4km, m3 & m4 ~3.2 m, m5 ~1.8 m. Mass uses area×length sum. Stress magnitude max 11.58 from m5. Using area ids mapped to cross-sectional areas, materials selected minimize stress and mass. No nodes at load/support repositioned per instructions.",\n  "calculation": "Mass = sum(length_i × area_i) ≈ 26.6 <30. Max stress 11.58 <15 allowable. Current distribution optimized. Testing small vertical/horizontal shifts of node_4 likely will not reduce max stress further without more mass or member resizing against instructions.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "No design topology change allowed, node movements limited to internal nodes except load/support fixed.
