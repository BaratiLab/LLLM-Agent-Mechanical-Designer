Current nodes mostly on baseline with 2 nodes elevated at 1.5m height; member areas mostly 1-3; mass is well under max (15.9 vs 30), but max stress is ~40 > 15. Need better load transfer and stress redistribution.",\n\n  "analysis": "Previous design shows excessive stress in members connecting node_3 and node_10 especially member_7, which has a small area and high stress. The elevated nodes (node_9 and node_10) are horizontally spaced but the vertical positioning at 1.5m likely creates long members with higher bending stress. Also, member_7 with area \'1\' (0.195) is overloaded. Eliminating direct long diagonal members and using triangulation can better distribute forces. To reduce mass and stress, optimize member areas, possibly introduce or reposition intermediate nodes above the baseline to achieve efficient triangular elements and reduce member spans. Removing member_7 may help, redistributing load through node_9 and node_10 with adjusted positions and areas.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_9 higher to about 2.0m, node_10 slightly lower (1.2m) to form better triangle with node_3 and node_2; add a new node (node_11) between node_3 and node_10 at higher elevation to reduce member span and stress; reduce member lengths and increase areas where necessary but keep total mass under 30; increase member areas only where forces are high; avoid member directly from node_3 to node_10 to reduce stress concentration.",\n\n  "proposal": "Modify current design by repositioning node_9 to (2.0, 2.0), node_10 to (4.0, 1.2), add node_11 at (3.0, 1.7). Remove member_7 (node_3-node_10). Add members node_3-node_11, node_11-node_10, node_11-node_9. Adjust member areas to balance stress and mass: larger area for high load members (up to area \'4\' or \'5\'), smaller for diagonal braces with less force. Total mass estimated below 30, max stress kept under ±15.",\n\n  "reasoning": "By raising node_9 and lowering node_10, the upper chord forms a more stable truss shape reducing member lengths and stresses. Addition of node_11 creates extra triangulation, sharing tensile and compressive forces across multiple members, reducing peak stresses. Removing the high stress diagonal member_7 eliminates a critical weak point. Selecting areas from the given discrete set allows optimized cross section for members with greater force without excessive mass penalty. The member layout follows typical truss design principles for stability and load distribution with pinned and roller supports fixed.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Length calculations: node_1-node_3 (2m length), node_3-node_9 (~2.236m), node_9-node_11 (~1.414m), node_11-node_10 (~1.414m), node_10-node_2 (2m), node_1-node_9 (~2.828m), node_9-node_2 (4.472m), node_3-node_11 (1.414m). Assign areas: high-load members like node_1-node_9 and node_3-node_9 use area \'4\'(3.128), shorter braces use area \'2\'(0.782) or \'3\'(1.759).
