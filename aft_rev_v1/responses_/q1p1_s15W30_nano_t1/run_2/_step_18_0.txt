  "preamble": "Optimize 4-node truss with given supports and load within stress ±15 and mass ≤ 30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load of -10 at node_3 at -45°, supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Node_1 and node_2 fixed, node_3 at (2,0). Current max stress 16.02 exceeds ±15. Mass 17.05 < 30 okay. Existing members and areas cause overstress in member_3 and -10.6 in member_1.",
  
  "analysis": "Existing design has node_4 at (3.2,1.3) with member areas mostly 2 or 3. Max tensile stress 16.02 on member_3 (node_1 to node_4). Stress slightly over limit. Member_1 too highly stressed in compression. Should redistribute forces by adjusting top node height and/or area modification.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Increased height of node_4 slightly from 1.3 to ~1.5 can reduce tension in member_3. Increase area of member_3 to area_id '4' (3.128) to reduce stress. Slightly increase area of member_1 to 4 (3.128) to reduce compressive stress. Use truss geometry symmetry to reduce bending and leverage compression/tension balance.",
  
  "proposal": "Keep node_1, node_2, and node_3 fixed to preserve boundary/load conditions. Move node_4 slightly higher to (3.2,1.5). Members: member_1(node_1 to node_3) area 4, member_2(node_3 to node_2) area 3, member_3(node_1 to node_4) area 4, member_4(node_2 to node_4) area 3, member_5(node_3 to node_4) area 2.",
  
  "reasoning": "Increasing node_4 height increases vertical lever arm reducing stress in node_1-to-node_4 member. Increasing area of member_1 and member_3 will reduce stress in them as stress ∝ force/area. Keep other members as is to avoid mass increase. Member_2 and member_4 kept at area 3 for good load transfer with reasonable mass. Member_5 kept minimal at 2 as it carries less load.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate length of members to estimate mass: member_1 length = distance(0,0)-(2,0)=2.0; member_3 length=distance(0,0)-(3.2,1.5)=sqrt(3.2²+1.5²)=3.53; member_2 length=distance(2,0)-(6,0)=4; member_4 length=distance(6,0)-(3.2,1.5)=sqrt(2.8²+1.5²)=3.16; member_5 length=distance(2,0)-(3.2,1.5)=sqrt(1.2²+1.5²)=1.92",
  
  "calculation": "Mass = sum(member_length * area_coefficient). Using area IDs {'2': 0.782, '3':1.759, '4':3.128}, compute mass: member_1=2.0*3.128=6.256; member_2=4.0*1.759=7.036; member_3=3.53*3.128=11.04; member_4=3.16*1.759=5.56; member_5=1.92*0.782=1.50; Total mass=6.256+7.036+11.04+5.56+1.50=31.4, slightly over limit. Reduce member_3 area to 3 (1.759) reduces its mass: 3.53*1.759=6.2. New total mass=6.256+7.036+6.2+5.56+1.50=26.55 under 30 max. Stress reduction due to area increase and lever arm increase expected to bring max stress under 15.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Final node positions: node_4 at (3.2, 1.5), areas assigned to reduce stress and satisfy mass limits. Geometry balanced for load paths and stiffness. No duplicates, supports and load nodes preserved. Ready for next FEM validation.",
