Current max stress 51.3 far exceeds limit ±15, mass 12.66 < 30 ok.",\n  "analysis": "Current design has excessive stress in member_2 (-51.3), which connects node_3(2,0) to node_13(3.2,1.2). All support/load nodes fixed; node_13 placement low and few members. Current member areas too small at critical members. Stress not redistributed well; need improved geometry and better force paths.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increase truss height at intermediate node(s) for better load distribution. Add a second node intermediate between node_3 and node_2 at higher Y to form a wider triangle. Adjust members to close force loops, allowing tension-compression members to balance forces better. Increase critical member areas prudently to reduce stress. Keep mass under 30.",\n  "proposal": "Add node_14 at (4.0,1.8). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_13, node_13-node_14, node_14-node_2, node_1-node_13, node_3-node_14, node_13-node_2, node_1-node_14. Assign areas to reduce stress: use mid-size areas on longer tension/compression members; minimal areas on base members. This triangulated layout provides multiple load paths.",\n  "reasoning": "Adding node_14 higher and more to right increases truss height and width, enhancing triangular stiffness and allowing stress redistribution. Multiple interconnections create alternative load paths reducing peak stress. Choosing area \'2\' (0.782) or \'3\' (1.759) on critical members balances stress without excessive mass. Base members use smaller areas \'1\' or \'0\'. Resulting design stays under mass limit while satisfying stress constraint by limited member forces and increased depth.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: n1-n3=2.0, n3-n13~1.44, n13-n14~0.9, n14-n2~1.8, n1-n13~2.56, n3-n14~2.52, n13-n2~2.24, n1-n14~4.2. Areas: mix 0.782 to 1.759 (~areas \'2\' and \'3\'). Total mass estimate about 19-22, acceptable. Stress reduction expected from triangulated geometry and higher sections.",\n  "calculation": "Member lengths × area approx: (2.0×1.759)+(1.44×0.782)+(0.9×0.782)+(1.8×1.759)+(2.56×0.782)+(2.52×0.782)+(2.24×1.759)+(4.2×0.195) ≈ 3.518+1.126+0.704+3.166+2.0+1.97+3.94+0.819=17.243 mass < 30.
