Current structure has overstress on member_2. Need to reduce max stress and control mass under 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_2 is overstressed (-22.58) exceeding ±15 limit. Current total mass 14.67 < 30, so mass is not an issue. Current node_4 at (2, 2.5) elevates compression in member_2. The diagonal member from node_3 to node_4 carries most load. Current cross-sectional area for member_2 is \'2\' = 0.782; increasing area may reduce stress but raises mass. Alternatively, repositioning node_4 to reduce force demand on member_2 or adding a new node and triangulating could improve internal force distribution. Members_1 and 4 under low stress imply no urgent need to increase their capacity.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Options: (1) increase area of member_2, (2) reposition node_4 higher or relieve load by adding intermediate node between node_3 and node_4 or (3) introduce an extra diagonal member from node_1 or node_4 to node_3 to redistribute forces. Aim to keep mass low and stress within limits.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add an intermediate node (node_5) vertically above node_3 at (2.0, 1.2) to split the highly stressed member_2 into two diagonals reducing effective length and stress. Introduce member_5 (\'node_3\', \'node_5\') and member_6 (\'node_5\', \'node_4\') both with area \'1\' = 0.195 (small area). Maintain original pinned and roller supports. Keep member_2 as direct diagonal but reduce cross section to \'1\' to further reduce overstress. Connections: members: (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_5), (node_5-node_4), (node_4-node_2), (node_2-node_1), plus possibly (node_1-node_5) to triangulate. This will improve load path and reduce max stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Splitting the long slant member_2 into two shorter members will reduce axial force in each, lowering stress. The new node_5 at mid-height provides force distribution and an additional triangle among node_1, 3 and 5 helps stability. Using smaller area for new members controls mass. Cross sections assigned carefully to keep stress ≤ ±15. Existing nodes for load/support not moved.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_3 to node_5 length approx 1.2m vertical, node_5 to node_4 approx 1.3m diagonal. Member_1 length ~2m, member_4 length 6m, node_4 to node_2 approx 4.5m diagonal. Area chosen to balance mass and stress: member_2 reduced from 0.782 to 0.195, new members small area 0.195. Estimated mass: sum(length*area). Total mass expected < 20 well under 30.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Mass (approx): member_1 (length 2m * 1) = 2, member_2 (new direct node_3-node_4 removed), now members_3 and 6 replace with 1.3m * 0.195=0.2535 + 1.2 * 0.195=0.234, member_3 (node_4-node_2) length ~4.5m * 1=4.5, member_4 (node_2-node_1) length 6m * 1=6, member_5 (node_1-node_5) length ~2.7m * 0.195=0.527. Total ~ 2+0.234+0.253+4.5+6+0.527=13.514 < 30. Stress distribution improved by triangularization and shorter members.
