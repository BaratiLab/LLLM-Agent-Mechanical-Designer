Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Max stress ±15, max mass 30. Current mass ~44.5 (too high), max stress ~7 (stress ok). Must reduce mass drastically while maintaining stress limit.",\n  "analysis": "Current design uses 6 members, total mass 44.5 exceeds max mass 30. Max stress is low (~7) indicating we can reduce member areas to save weight. Node positions at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), (2,2.2), (4,1.9). Mid nodes high for load support. Members have large areas 3,4,5 causing mass overflow. Need to reduce area sizes or redesign with fewer/more efficient members. Load at node_3 downward-left -45° means diagonal bracing needed from support nodes to node_3 and upper nodes to carry load efficiently. Possibly adding a node above node_3 for shorter compression members and reduce mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce areas of heavy members, especially member_4 (area 5). Check force flow from node_3 to supports. Try smaller cross-section for longer members. Possibly add intermediate node to reduce length and stress. Avoid excessive diagonal members crossing unnecessarily. Use node 3 at (2,0), node 9 at (2,1.5) reduces height, node 10 at (4,1.5) reduces length and mass. Assign smaller areas where low stress. Keep mass < 30.",\n  "proposal": "Keep nodes_1,2,3 fixed. Add node_9 at (2.0,1.5), node_10 at (4.0,1.5). Members: #1(node_1-node_3), #2(node_3-node_9), #3(node_9-node_10), #4(node_10-node_2), #5(node_1-node_9), #6(node_9-node_2), #7(node_3-node_10). Assign areas mostly 2 or 3, small areas for longer members, larger for short. Aim total mass below 30, max stress <15.",\n  "reasoning": "Reduced height to 1.5 from current 2.2 and 1.9 to shorten members and reduce mass. The geometry still provides enough vertical and diagonal bracing to resist load at node_3 with balanced member forces. Including member_7 (node_3 to node_10) adds stiffness and load path, but use small area to save mass. Using areas 2 (0.782) and 3 (1.759) in small members balances mass and stress.
