Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Current max stress 65 >15, mass 6.72 <30.",\n  "analysis": "High stress on member_4 (node_1-node_9) and member_5 (node_3-node_2), member areas too small or geometry causing stress concentration. Current structure has too few members to distribute load, leading to overload. Mass is low but stress violation critical.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Need to reduce stress peaks by better force paths. Add triangular bracing with additional node to reduce long member stresses, use larger areas on short high-stress members, keep total mass under limit.",\n  "proposal": "Add a new node near load node_3 to create two short diagonals connected to supports, replace small cross members with optimal section sizes. Increase areas on heavily stressed members to reduce stress under limit. Geometry: node_1 and node_2 fixed; add node_11 at (3.15, 1.35), connect node_3-node_11, node_11-node_2, node_1-node_11.",\n  "reasoning": "Adding node_11 creates two load paths, reduces member length and stress. Choose areas to keep mass ≤ 30. Use area 3 (1.759) for longer tension members and area 1 (0.195) or 2 (0.782) for shorter/compression members to balance mass. Avoid overstressing any member and keep mass low.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approx: node_1-node_3 =2 m, node_3-node_11= sqrt((3.15-2)^2+(1.35-0)^2)=1.79 m, node_11-node_2= sqrt((6-3.15)^2+(0-1.35)^2)=3.21 m, node_1-node_11= approx 3.29 m, node_3-node_2=4 m, node_9 removed.",\n  "calculation": "Calculate member masses: member length × area (density factor=1). Member stresses evenly distributed by new triangular truss. Mass estimate: (2 ×1.759)+(1.79×0.782)+(3.21×1.759)+(3.29×0.195)+(4×0.195) ≈ 3.518 +1.4 +5.65 +0.64 +0.78 = ~12 mass (well below 30).
