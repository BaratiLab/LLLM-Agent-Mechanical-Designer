Max stress >15 on member_4; redesign needed. Mass well below limits, room to increase sections.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current design with 4 nodes and members results in a member with 61.37 stress >> 15 allowable tensile limit. Mass (11.9) is under 30, so mass is acceptable. The stress issue is critical on \'member_4\' (\'node_1\' to \'node_11\'). The problem likely arises due to inadequate geometry or inadequate cross-section. The design can be improved by adjusting node_11 or adding another node for a truss with well-distributed members and forces, aiming to reduce stress in the diagonal member and have all stresses within ±15.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Member_4 too overloaded tensile. Possibly longer member causing higher stresses or small cross-section. Consider elevating node_11, adding new node(s) to get triangular geometry. Increase area in critical members to reduce stresses. Use mid-range sections to balance mass and stress.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Add one extra node between node_3 and node_2 at y~1.0 to form a 5-node truss with a stable triangular shape. Adjust members as: connect node_1-node_3, node_3-node_11, node_11-node_12 (new), node_12-node_2, node_1-node_11, node_3-node_12, node_11-node_2, node_12-node_11. Assign area IDs to keep stress under limits and mass low.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Adding node_12 near (4.0,1.0) splits long members and helps distribute forces, reducing maximum stresses. Using moderate cross sections (area_id 2 or 3) for compressive/tension members; smaller for shorter members. This configuration improves load path and stabilizes the truss. Overall mass increases but remains below max. This reduces the critical tension in member_4 and balances stresses around 15 limit, which is design goal.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Areas used: area \'3\' = 1.759, area \'2\' = 0.782, area \'1\' = 0.195.
