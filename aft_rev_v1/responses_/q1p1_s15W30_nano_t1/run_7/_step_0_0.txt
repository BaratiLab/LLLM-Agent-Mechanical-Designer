  "preamble": "Optimize a 2D truss with 3 given nodes, minimizing stress and mass within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given three nodes with pinned and roller supports and a -10N at 45° down-left on node_3. Aim for a statically stable closed truss using these nodes plus minimal additions if needed. Stress ≤ ±15, mass ≤30 from member length times chosen area.",
  
  "analysis": "Nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0) are collinear at the bottom line, so the current form is unstable as a truss using only these nodes. A closed truss means all nodes connected and forming a stable polygon. We will add an additional node above to form a stable triangle. The triangle is the simplest closed truss. The support conditions: pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 allow vertical reactions to support the load. Load on node_3 is -10N at -45°, i.e. 10N diagonally down-left. We will connect members between all nodes (including the new node) to form a triangle, examining stress to pick minimal area sizes to keep stresses ≤ ±15 and mass ≤30.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "A triangle with base nodes at node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), and a new node_4 above node_3 at approx (2, y) with y>0 creates a simple stable truss. Approximate y for optimum performance. Use equilibrium and member force relations to estimate axial forces and check stress.",
  
  "reasoning": "Triangular trusses have no internal moments and are the most optimal closed forms. Placing the additional node directly above node_3 at (2,3.5) creates a good height for force resolution without excessive member length (keeping mass low). Members: (node_1–node_4), (node_2–node_4), (node_1–node_3), (node_3–node_2). Check forces assuming pin-jointed truss with axial members only. Assume linear elastic. Cross-sectional areas chosen to accommodate member loads maintaining stress limits and minimal mass. Use area from discrete set. Stress = Force/Area, Area needed = Force / allowable stress (15).",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: L_13=2.0m, L_32=4.0m, L_14=√((2−0)^2+(3.5−0)^2)=√(4+12.25)=~4.03m, L_24 =√((6−2)^2+(0−3.5)^2)=√(16+12.25)=~5.41m. Forces: resolve node_3 force (-10N at -45°), break into components: Fx=-7.07N, Fy=-7.07N. Analyze equilibrium at node_3 and node_4 to find member forces. Use truss method or method of joints.",
  
  "calculation": "Assumptions: members only carry axial load, pinned joints, loads are static. \n\nAt node_3 (2,0): external load Fx=-7.07, Fy=-7.07N downward left.\nMembers connected to node_3: (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), (node_3-node_4). However, node_3 isn't connected to node_4 to keep the truss closed and minimal we add (node_1-node_4) and (node_2-node_4) only. So we form members: (1-3), (3-2), (1-4), (2-4), (3-4).
