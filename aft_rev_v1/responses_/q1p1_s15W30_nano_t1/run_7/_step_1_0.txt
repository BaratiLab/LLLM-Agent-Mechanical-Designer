  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress currently 12.49 below 15 limit. Total mass 14.74 under 30 max. Load at node_3. Supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. Nodal moves allowed only on node_3 and node_4 (load/support nodes fixed).",
  "analysis": "Max compressive stress is high on member_1 (-12.49). Members linked to node_3 carry significant stress. Current geometry has node_3 at (2,0), node_4 at (2,3.5). Redistribution of node_4 upward or sideways within allowed range could balance load paths. Member areas uniformly set to 2 (area 0.782). Adjusting areas may reduce stress.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 highly stressed, is node_3 to node_1 horizontal member. Node_3 is fixed vertically. Node_4 can be moved vertically and horizontally. Increasing vertical height and adjusting node_4 laterally may improve truss geometry to reduce bending and compressive stress.",
  "reasoning": "To minimize max stress, optimize geometry for load distribution. Moving node_4 slightly upwards and laterally can reduce large compression in member_1 by better triangulation. Also selectively increase area of member_1 and nearby members as stress is high there, while reducing low-stress members to save mass. Check if total mass stays under 30. No changes to load/support nodes.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Start by moving node_4 from (2,3.5) to approx (2.2,4.0) to increase triangle height and lateral support. Adjust areas: member_1 area to 3 (1.759), member_3 area to 3, members_2,4,5 area to 2 or 1 to reduce mass while keeping strength. Calculate member lengths, masses, update stresses assuming proportional to member force/area.",
  "calculation": "Updated node_4: (2.18,4.05). Member lengths: m1 (node_1-node_3) = 2, m2 (node_3-node_2) = 4, m3 (node_3-node_4) ~4.4, m4 (node_2-node_4) ~4.31, m5 (node_1-node_4) ~4.48. Choose areas: m1=1.759 (3), m3=1.759, m2=0.782 (2), m4=0.195 (1), m5=0.782 (2). Compute approximate total mass = sum(length*area) = m1: 2*1.759=3.518 + m2:4*0.782=3.128 + m3:4.4*1.759=7.74 + m4:4.31*0.195=0.84 + m5:4.48*0.782=3.5 sum=approximately 18.7 well under mass max 30. Increased area on critical members reduces stress and total still under mass limit.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 repositioned upward and right improves load path. Increased area on high stress members reduces stress. Mass within limits. Geometry unchanged for load/support nodes. Structure remains closed. No duplicate nodes/members.",
