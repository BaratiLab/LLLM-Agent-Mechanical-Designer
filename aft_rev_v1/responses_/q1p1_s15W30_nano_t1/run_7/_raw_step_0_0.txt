A closed truss means all nodes connected and forming a stable polygon. We will add an additional node above to form a stable triangle. The triangle is the simplest closed truss. The support conditions: pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 allow vertical reactions to support the load. Load on node_3 is -10N at -45°, i.e. 10N diagonally down-left. We will connect members between all nodes (including the new node) to form a triangle, examining stress to pick minimal area sizes to keep stresses ≤ ±15 and mass ≤30.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "A triangle with base nodes at node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), and a new node_4 above node_3 at approx (2, y) with y>0 creates a simple stable truss.

Use equilibrium and member force relations to estimate axial forces and check stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular trusses have no internal moments and are the most optimal closed forms. Placing the additional node directly above node_3 at (2,3.5) creates a good height for force resolution without excessive member length (keeping mass low). Members: (node_1–node_4), (node_2–node_4), (node_1–node_3), (node_3–node_2). Check forces assuming pin-jointed truss with axial members only. Assume linear elastic. Cross-sectional areas chosen to accommodate member loads maintaining stress limits and minimal mass. Use area from discrete set.
