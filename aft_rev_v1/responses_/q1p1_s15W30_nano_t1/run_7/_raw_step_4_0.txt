Nodes for load and support fixed. Member areas range 1–5 with appropriate assignment. New node added inside to support closure and reduce stress. Structure is stable and stress well distributed.",\n  "analysis": "Structural addition of node_5 with internal members reduces max stress significantly from prior high stress iterations. Member areas correspond reasonably to stress levels. Mass is well below max. No member stresses exceed ±15. Node movements restricted to free nodes only. Load and support nodes unchanged.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Potential for further improvement is limited because max stress is already low (<5) with reasonable mass margin. Adjusting node_5 slightly could be explored but likely minimal gains. Given constraints and FEM results, current design is robust and near optimal.",\n  "reasoning": "Max stress is safely within constraint, allowing a factor of ~3.5 of margin. Mass utilization is moderate (19.58 of 30). Increasing member areas to reduce stress further would increase mass unnecessarily, and reducing them would risk exceeding stress limits. Node_5 position balances forces efficiently. Additional nodes could increase complexity and mass without clear benefit. All members unique and closed structure maintained.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas produce given masses that total 19.58. Stress in critical members is ≤4.344 and well distributed. No tensile or compressive member stress above ±15. Loads and boundary conditions accounted correctly. Node_5 coordinates (2.0, 2.0) placed centrally within the span to optimize force distribution. Member connections ensure structural stability and a closed truss.",\n  "calculation": "Total mass sum matches FEM mass; max stress is far below allowable. No members need resizing or re-positioning under current constraints. The current iteration achieved significant stress reduction compared to earlier steps. Stress in critical members (member_1, member_4) are low. Member areas are consistent with their stress demands.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints satisfied: max stress ≤ ±15, total mass ≤ 30, no duplicate nodes or members, load and support nodes fixed.
