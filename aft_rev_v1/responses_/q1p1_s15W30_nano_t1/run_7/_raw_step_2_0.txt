Max stress abs ≤15, total mass ≤30 from discrete area options. Current design max stress 16.6 >15, mass 18.46 <30. Need to reduce max stress by better force distribution and member sizing.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_4 (node_2-node_4) overstressed at 16.6, set area_id=1 (0.195) but high stress indicates insufficient cross section or inefficient force path. Node_4 slightly raised to 4.05m increased stress. Optimizing node_4 position higher or to left/right helps distribute load. Member_5 and member_3 large area and mass, so potential to redistribute forces by changing node_4 position and member connectivity.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_4 can be shifted slightly horizontally and vertically for better stress distribution; possibly add a diagonal member or adjust existing members to form stable triangular substructures. Avoid adding unnecessary members to keep mass low and complexity minimal.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep nodes_1,2,3 fixed; move node_4 to (2.5, 3.7) to optimize force distribution. Adjust members to form triangle substructures: members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_2, and node_1-node_4. Assign cross sectional areas optimized to lower max stress: Increase area on member_4 to area_id 2 (0.782), members from node_1 and node_3 to node_4 remain area_id 3 (1.759), keep other members at minimum satisfying stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Raising node_4 slightly less than previous iteration maintains adequate height to reduce bending stresses on member_4 by decreasing load transferred directly to it. Area increases on member_4 reduce stress below 15. Areas chosen balance mass and required strength from discrete area set. Members connecting node_1 and node_3 to node_4 maintain area 3 to carry tension/compression without excessive mass. Members 1 and 2 sized smaller as stresses are low there.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths recalculated: member_4 length ~ sqrt((6-2.5)^2 + (0-3.7)^2) ≈ 4.43, area 0.782 mass ~ 3.46; other members lengths recalculated with new node_4; total mass estimated < 19, well below 30 limit; max stress expected <15 based on increased section and better load path.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths: m1(1-3):2.0, m2(3-2):4.0, m3(3-4): sqrt((2.0-2.5)^2 + (0.0-3.7)^2)=~3.71, m4(2-4):~4.43, m5(1-4): sqrt((2.5-0)^2 + (3.7-0)^2)=~4.46. Select areas: m1:1(0.195), m2:1(0.195), m3:3(1.759), m4:2(0.782), m5:3(1.759).
