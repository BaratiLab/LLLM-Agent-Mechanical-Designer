Problematic member likely carries load poorly due to its geometry and area. Current nodes 1,2 fixed at baseline; node_4 likely too low; node_3 on baseline too close to node_1 and in compressive tension interplay. Need to reshape for lower max stress and maintain mass ≤ 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress is highest on member_6 connecting node_3 and node_4, which has smallest area = 1. Option: reposition node_4 higher for better triangulation, change member areas to increase strength in critical members, possibly simplify members to reduce stress concentrators. Avoid heavy members with largest area unless necessary, trade-off between length and area. Possibly add no new nodes to keep complexity minimal.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep supports at node_1 (0,0) and node_2 (6,0), keep load at node_3 (2,0). Raise node_4 vertically to about 3.0 for better triangulation. Use three members: node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, and node_3-node_4; and diagonal bracing node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4. Areas chosen to limit stress: use area_id \'3\' or \'4\' for horizontal members and \'2\' or \'3\' for diagonals. Remove member_6 (node_3-node_4) from area 1 (too small, high stress). Instead increase node_4 height to reduce stress on diagonal members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Raising node_4 gives better force distribution allowing lower stress; choosing larger areas for highly stressed members and smaller areas for less stressed to minimize mass. Avoid overused small area on critical diagonals to reduce max stress. Keep horizontal members with moderate area for stability. Simplify structure slightly by removing or reassigning member_6 area. Ensure mass under 30 by sizing areas carefully and keeping node_4 vertical, not far horizontally.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_1-(0,0), node_2-(6,0), node_3-(2,0), node_4~(2,3).
