Need a closed truss with all nodes connected, minimal stress/mass. Areas from discrete set. No node repositioning. Must add members and possibly nodes to close structure within constraints.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The provided nodes lie collinearly along x-axis at y=0. A truss with these only three collinear nodes cannot be closed if members connect only existing nodes. Need additional nodes above or below line to form triangle or polygon. Load at node_3 is downward-left diagonal, introducing bending and axial forces. Constraints are max stress ±15 and mass ≤30 with mass as sum of (length*area). Area selected from given discrete options.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding one node above line near node_3 to form triangle, connecting all nodes to form closed truss. Triangular form ensures closed truss and efficient stress distribution. Use pinned and roller supports at ends as given. Member selection with small to moderate area to reduce mass but ensure stress limits. Stress approximated via axial force = Load projected on member axis, length via Euclidean distance.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "With 3 collinear nodes, add node_4 above node_3 at (2.0,1.5) ~ midpoint between node_1 and node_2 horizontally. Members chosen: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_1-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3. Adding node_4 creates triangular geometry stabilizing load and reducing stress. Stress verified by simplified method: assume load distributes through members connected at node_3 and node_4, simple axial stress = force/area, force estimated by static equilibrium by resolving load and support reactions. Area selection starts from 1 (max 1 unit area) for short members and increases where stress high to reduce stress below ±15. Mass computed as sum(length*area).

Load at node_3: -10 at -45° splits into Fx = -10*cos(45)= -7.07, Fy = -10*sin(45)= -7.07. Supports reaction can be approximated and axial forces estimated in each member. Use area 2 (~0.782) for short members, 3 (~1.759) for longer carrying more load. Approximate mass: ∑ length*area ~ 6*1.759 + 2*0.782 +4*0.782 +2.5*0.782 +4.27*1.759 +1.5*0.195 = about 29.13 <30.
