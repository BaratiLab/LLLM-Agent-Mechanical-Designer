Load at node_3 and supports fixed. Node_4 moved from 1.5 to 3 in iteration 1 improved stress from ~36 to 9.04. Areas range 0.195 to 19.5. Need to reduce maximum negative stress -9.04 on member_5 and compressive on member_1.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_5 has highest (compressive) stress magnitude and relatively small area (2). Member_2 has large area (4) but low stress -1.0, member_4 moderate stress 5.0 and area 2. Node_4 moved up to increase triangle height, reducing stress in members connected to it. Possibly increasing area or repositioning nodes could further reduce max stress. Member_1 still has compressive stress -5.8 with area 3. Mass close to limit suggests increasing area is limited. Better node placement (e.g., shifting node_3 horizontally or vertically) might decrease load-induced stress. All nodes must remain fixed except node_3 and node_4 (load at node_3 fixed in x,y). Node_3 is load node, cannot move position as per instructions—it must remain (2.0, 0.0). So only node_4 can be moved. Strategic move of node_4 around (2,3) might redistribute stresses. Members are closed loop with members connecting node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4. Possibly increasing node_4 y further or slight x shift to reduce stress on member_5 and member_1. Area adjustments: currently members have areas \'3\', \'4\', \'3\', \'2\', \'2\'. Member_2 area\'s large but low stress - maybe reduce area here and increase in member_5 or member_1 if needed for stress balancing. Goal is minimal max stress within mass limit.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_3 fixed at (2,0). Move node_4 in y or slight x to improve stress distribution. Possibly reduce member_2 area from \'4\' to \'3\' or \'2\' to save mass, increase member_5 area from \'2\' to \'3\' or \'4\' if possible to lower compressive stress -9.0. Also member_1 area flexibly chosen in 3 previously, maybe increase. Total mass sums currently to 28.6, some margin to increase specific areas while lowering others. Keep mass ≤ 30. Estimated total member length and corresponding member masses need recalculation after node move.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Constrain movement to node_4 only since load/support nodes fixed. Slight move of node_4 upwards or slightly towards node_2 (right) to reduce high compressive stress in member_5 and member_1. Reduce area of member_2 given low stress -1 to save mass. Use saved mass to increase area of member_5 or member_1 to reduce stress magnitude. Since member_5 has highest compressive stress, increasing its area reduces stress per unit. Member_1 also somewhat high compressive stress, increment area there instead of member_3 or member_4 whose stresses are lower. These adjustments should reduce max stress below current 9.04. Check total mass after adjustment and node repositioning to ensure ≤30.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Areas chosen from given discrete list: use \'2\' (0.782), \'3\' (1.759), \'4\' (3.128). Current member lengths approx: member_1 ~2.236 (from (0,0) to (2,0) horizontal?), member_5 length depends on node_4 position. Current approx length member_5 ~3.605 (from (2,0) to (2,3)). Moving node_4 higher increases member_5 length, which can increase mass unless area is reduced. So move node_4 slightly right but not necessarily higher. Member masses: length * area (from dictionary indices). Adjust member_2 area down from 4 to 2 (3.128 → 0.782) saves mass; allocate mass to member_5 and member_1 by increasing area to 3 or 4.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Move node_4 from (2.0,3.0) to (2.4,3.1). Recalculate approximate lengths: member_5 from (2,0) to (2.4,3.1) length ≈ sqrt(0.4² + 3.1²) ≈ 3.129. Member_1 length unchanged at 2.0 (0,0) to (2,0). Member_2 length from (6,0) to (2,0) is 4. Exact length constant as nodes fixed. Reduce member_2 area from 4 to 2 to save mass (saved: (3.128 - 0.782)*length 4 = ~8.36 mass units). Increase member_5 area from 2 to 4 (0.782 to 3.128) increases mass by (3.128 - 0.782)*3.129 ≈ 7.9; net increase approx 0.6 in mass. Increase member_1 area from 3 to 4 (1.759 to 3.128), length ~2.0, mass increase: (3.128-1.759)*2 = 2.738; total mass now ~28.6 - 8.36 + 7.9 + 2.74 = 30.0 approx max limit. Max stress expected to reduce by increased area in high stress members; member_5 stress magnitude should decrease approximately inversely with area increase, from -9.04 * (0.782/3.128) ≈ -2.26. Member_1 likely to reduce from -5.8 to near -3.2. Member_2 stress may increase upon area decrease but was low previously -1.0 to something higher but likely < -5. Overall max stress approx ~5 still below 15. Design stays stable within constraints.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_final": "Updated members: member_1 area:4, member_2 area:2, member_3:3, member_4:2, member_5:4. Node_4 moved slightly to (2.4, 3.1) to spread stresses. Mass ~30, max stress reduced to ~5. Meets constraints, further optimization has marginal returns.
