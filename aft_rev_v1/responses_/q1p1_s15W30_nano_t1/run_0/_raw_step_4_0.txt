Optimize node_4 position and areas. Constraint: stress ≤ ±15, mass ≤ 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design mass 30.64 slightly exceeds 30 limit. Max stress 4.6 < 15 is okay. Members mostly oversized causing excess mass. Slightly reducing member areas and repositioning node_4 upward and right can optimize force flow, reduce mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove ineffective members or reduce their areas. Node_4 position controls force triangle geometry so placing node_4 near (2.7, 3.7) for better load distribution. Use member areas mostly 2 or 3 to reduce mass while staying in stress limits.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep nodes 1,2,3 fixed. Move node_4 to (2.7, 3.7). Members: n1-n3 area 3, n2-n3 area 2, n1-n4 area 2, n2-n4 area 2, n3-n4 area 3. This gives better geometry and lighter cross sections still satisfying stresses.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Longer height at node_4 reduces bending effects, better load path. Smaller cross sections on less stressed members and moderate on heavily loaded. This balances total mass around 29.5 and max stress under 15.

Area mapping: \'2\'=0.782, \'3\'=1.759. Calculate mass ≈ sum(length × area). Total mass ≈ (2*1.759)+(4*0.782)+(4.56*0.782)+(4.87*0.782)+(3.74*1.759)=3.518+3.128+3.566+3.809+6.579=20.6 well below limit, so areas can be adjusted up slightly if needed.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Increase n3-n4 area to 4 (3.128) to handle tension better (3.74*3.128=11.68 mass), total updated mass ~25.
