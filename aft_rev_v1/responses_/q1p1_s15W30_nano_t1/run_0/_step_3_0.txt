  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while keeping mass under 30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress currently 4.62 < 15 limit; mass 29.77 < 30 limit. Node_1 and node_2 fixed due to supports and loads. Node_3 fixed due to load. Node_4 can be moved to optimize stress distribution.",
  "analysis": "Max stress at member_4 (node_2-node_4). Move node_4 to reduce member_4 stress by improving force distribution. Check lengths and angles for stress and mass tradeoff.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing node_4 height slightly may reduce member_4 stress. Also slight left shift reduces horizontal member length and stress in members 2 and 4. Maintain truss closure and stability.",
  "reasoning": "Current member areas: member_1:4, member_2:2, member_3:3, member_4:2, member_5:4. Stress max at member_4 with 4.62. Moving node_4 from (2.4,3.1) to (2.2,3.3) reduces horizontal span of member_4 and improves member_4 force alignment, lowering stress. This should keep mass stable as member lengths don't increase significantly.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Estimate member_4 length old: sqrt((6-2.4)^2 + (0-3.1)^2) = sqrt(3.6^2 + 3.1^2) ≈ 4.77. New length sqrt((6-2.2)^2 + (0-3.3)^2) = sqrt(3.8^2 + 3.3^2) ≈ 5.04 slightly longer but may reduce stress by better load path. Member_5 length changes minimally. Member_1 length almost unchanged. Mass approx same, likely < 30.",
  "calculation": "Node_4 moved to (2.2, 3.3). Member areas unchanged. Expect member_4 stress < 4.62, member stresses balanced better. Mass ≤ 30.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Check constraints: max stress < 15, total mass < 30, no change to load/support nodes, closed truss maintained, node and member dicts consistent.",
