  "preamble": "Optimization of 2D truss minimizing max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress under Â±15, total mass under 30; load applied at node_3, supports fixed. Current stresses and mass well within limits.",
  "analysis": "Current design nodes fixed at supports and load. Node_4 position and member areas chosen to balance mass and stress. Max stress at member_3 (7.6) well below limit, mass 18.6 under limit 30. Slight reductions in stress from prior iterations noted.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "No violation of constraints. Lowering stresses further risks increasing mass or losing constraint satisfaction. Members' area sizes and node_4 position near optimum given prior iterations.",
  "reasoning": "Stress can reduce by node movement or area adjustment. Load/support nodes fixed, only node_4 adjustable. Previous varied node_4 vertically and horizontally, best stress at ~7.6 found. Member areas already optimized to lower mass. Any modification likely worsens either mass or max stress.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculations on member lengths, stresses and areas show balanced stress at members with smallest feasible areas that keep max stress acceptable. Attempts to decrease max stress below 7 caused increased mass or moved stress to other members.",
  "calculation": "Node_4 at (2.3, 3.0), members sized as: member_1=3, member_2=2, member_3=2, member_4=2, member_5=3 yield mass 18.63, max stress 7.6. Mass under 30, max stress under 15. Further changes do not improve max stress noticeably or violate constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate members or nodes, fixed load/support nodes unchanged, all constraints met, design structurally sound and optimized for stress and mass balance.",
