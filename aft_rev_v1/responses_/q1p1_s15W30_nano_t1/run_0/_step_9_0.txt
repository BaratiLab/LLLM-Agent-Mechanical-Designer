  "preamble": "Optimize existing 2D truss reducing max stress under load with constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 9.13 < 15 and mass 18.91 < 30. Load at node_3, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Only node_4 free to move.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is member_5 (-9.13), compressive and near limit. Mass is well below max. Changing cross-section areas mostly done, node_4 position affects stress balance. Member_3 mass high (6.49) with area 3, member_5 area 2. Stress magnitude imbalance between members linked to node_4.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "A more balanced force distribution achieved by adjusting node_4 y-position or slightly shifting x could reduce peak stresses. Consider slightly increasing node_4 height to relieve compressive stress in member_5, but not too much to avoid adding mass or inducing high tensile stress on member_3.",
  
  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 slightly up and slightly left to improve force distribution. Increase area for member_5 from 2 to 3 to handle compression better. Decrease area of member_3 from 3 to 2 to save mass since its tensile stress is lower. Keeps total mass controlled and stress max minimized. Other members area unchanged due to constraints and their lower stress.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Adjust node_4 from (2.4,2.8) to approx (2.3,3.0) to relieve stress concentration in member_5. Area of member_5 from '2' to '3' (from 0.782 to 1.759 cross-section) reduces stress per area. Member_3 area from '3' to '2' reduces mass and aligns with reduced stress after node move.",
  
  "calculation": "New node_4 position (2.3, 3.0) dramatically improved in iteration_6 with max stress 7.6 and mass 18.63. Adjust areas accordingly to improve further. Area lookups: '2'=0.782, '3'=1.759. Member mass proportional to length*area. Minimize max stress by balancing tensile and compressive stresses. Expected max stress target < 8.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Check node changes for load/support fixed. Unique members preserved, increased member_5 area to 3 for compression, decreased member_3 area to 2 for tensile save mass. Mass estimated <20, well below max 30. Max stress improved expected <9. Stop after next iteration if no improvement beyond this.",
