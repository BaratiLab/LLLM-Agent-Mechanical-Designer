Load at node_3, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Only node_4 free to move.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress is member_5 (-9.13), compressive and near limit. Mass is well below max. Changing cross-section areas mostly done, node_4 position affects stress balance. Member_3 mass high (6.49) with area 3, member_5 area 2. Stress magnitude imbalance between members linked to node_4.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "A more balanced force distribution achieved by adjusting node_4 y-position or slightly shifting x could reduce peak stresses. Consider slightly increasing node_4 height to relieve compressive stress in member_5, but not too much to avoid adding mass or inducing high tensile stress on member_3.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 slightly up and slightly left to improve force distribution. Increase area for member_5 from 2 to 3 to handle compression better. Decrease area of member_3 from 3 to 2 to save mass since its tensile stress is lower. Keeps total mass controlled and stress max minimized. Other members area unchanged due to constraints and their lower stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Adjust node_4 from (2.4,2.8) to approx (2.3,3.0) to relieve stress concentration in member_5. Area of member_5 from \'2\' to \'3\' (from 0.782 to 1.759 cross-section) reduces stress per area. Member_3 area from \'3\' to \'2\' reduces mass and aligns with reduced stress after node move.",\n  \n  "calculation": "New node_4 position (2.3, 3.0) dramatically improved in iteration_6 with max stress 7.6 and mass 18.63. Adjust areas accordingly to improve further. Area lookups: \'2\'=0.782, \'3\'=1.759. Member mass proportional to length*area. Minimize max stress by balancing tensile and compressive stresses. Expected max stress target < 8.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Check node changes for load/support fixed.
