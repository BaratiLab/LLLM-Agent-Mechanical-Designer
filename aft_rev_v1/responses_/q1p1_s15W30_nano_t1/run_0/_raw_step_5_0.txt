Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved up and right increased stress compared to previous step. Member_3 has max stress 7.46 with area 2, member_5 stress is low (-2.3) but largest mass (11.8).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has relatively low max stress but uneven stress distribution and member_5 is heavy. Adjust node_4 to balance force paths and reduce stress concentration on member_3. Member_3 area might be slightly small given stress magnitude; consider area increase or node shift to reduce stress. Member_5 mass can be trimmed by area reduction if stress allows. Node_4 movement can fine tune geometry to reduce bending/moment effects causing stress peaks.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on lowering member_3 stress by moving node_4 slightly down and left, closer to node_3 than previous 2.7,3.7. Possibly around (2.4,3.3). Check if member areas can be adjusted: keep member_5 close to area 3 or 4 (3.128 or 3.128) to reduce mass while respecting stress. Member_3 can stay 2 or increase to 3 if stress high. Member_1 area can be maintained or reduced if stress low.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Since load and supports fixed, only node_4 can move. Moving node_4 closer to nodes 1 and 3 reduces length of members 3 and 5, thus reducing mass and stress. Member areas must be chosen from given discrete options. Member_3 stress high, so area 3 (1.759) or 4 (3.128) suitable to reduce stress. Member_5 stress is low (2.3 compressive), area can be reduced to reduce mass. Member_1 stress quite high compressive, area 3 (1.759) is acceptable. Balance areas to keep total mass <30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Equations: stress ∝ force / (area × length), mass ∝ length × area. Shortening members decreases length, reduces mass and stress. Optimize node_4 x,y to ~ (2.4-2.5,3.2-3.3) to improve. Choose member_3 area = 3 (1.759) or 4 (3.128), member_5 area = 3 (3.128), member_1 area = 3 or 2, member_2 and 4 keep at area 2 (0.782) to save mass.
