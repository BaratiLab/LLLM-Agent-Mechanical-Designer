  "preamble": "Optimize nodal position of free node_4 and member areas to minimize max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 8.37 < 15 (OK), mass 17.84 < 30 (OK); area selections mostly mid range; node_4 moved recently from 2.3,3.0 to 2.6,2.7; members mostly 2 or 3 area.",
  "analysis": "Current max stress is from member_3 (node_1-node_4) at 8.37 with area 2 (0.782 approx). Mass is well within bounds so we can consider slightly increasing some areas or adjusting node_4 to reduce stress. Load at node_3 fixed; supports fixed. Node_4 was lowered from 3.0 height to 2.7, likely decreasing lever arm and stress. Member_3 is under tensile stress and quite high compared to others; consider shifting node_4 horizontally to reduce bending. Member_1 and member_5 are compressive; member_1 stress is about -6.6 with area 3 (1.759). Potentially increase area of highest stress members or reposition node_4 to balance. Member_2 (node_2-node_3) has low stress (-3.79) with smallest area 2, could be kept same. Member_4 moderate tension (4.85).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try shifting node_4 slightly left (toward node_3) to reduce tension in member_3; also possibly slightly higher vertical component to balance compressive members. Consider increasing member_3 area from 2 to 3 to reduce stress as it is max tensile. Keep others same or slightly adjust member_5 area down to offset mass increase.",
  "reasoning": "Increasing area of max stressed member reduces stress magnitude (stress = force/area). Moving free node_4 to optimize geometry affects internal force distribution. The tension in member_3 can be reduced by decreasing length or changing angle. Increasing cross sectional area from 0.782 to 1.759 roughly halves stress. The total mass budget allows this with minor adjustments on other members. Node_4 movement is constrained to free node; load/support nodes fixed. Member connectivity should remain same as current iteration. Aim to preserve closed shape for stability.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate new node_4 position by shifting horizontally from 2.6 to ~2.4 and vertically slightly higher from 2.7 to ~2.8. New area selection: member_3 area from '2' (0.782) to '3' (1.759), member_5 reduce from '3' (1.759) to '2' (0.782) to keep mass approx same. Other members remain same.",
  "calculation": "Approximate length(node_1-node_4): from (0,0)-(2.6,2.7) length=3.74; new pos (2.4,2.8) length=√(2.4²+2.8²)=3.70 (shorter). Member_3 mass proportional to length*area: old=3.74*0.782=~2.93; new=3.70*1.759=6.51 (increase ~3.6). Member_5 current length node_3(2,0)-node_4(2.6,2.7)=3.18; new length (2,0)-(2.4,2.8)=√(0.4²+2.8²)=~2.83. Mass old =3.18*1.759=5.59; new=2.83*0.782=2.21 (mass decrease ~3.38). Net change mass ~+0.2. Total current mass=17.84; estimated new mass ~18.0 <30 OK. Max stress expected to drop for member_3 from 8.37 to approx 8.37*(0.782/1.759)=~3.72 and member_5 stress expected increase by ~2.3 times but member_5 is compressive and lower stress currently (-4.11), so new stress acceptable. Other members unchanged. Max stress budget clearly improved.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New design should have lowered max stress below 8 and still mass well below limit. Free node moved slightly left and up to optimize tension distribution, area redistributed to reduce max tensile stress while balancing mass. No constraint violated. Continuing optimization feasible but diminishing returns expected.",
