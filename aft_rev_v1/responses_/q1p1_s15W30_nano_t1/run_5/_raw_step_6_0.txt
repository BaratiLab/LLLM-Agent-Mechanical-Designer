Load at node_3, supports fixed at node_1, node_2. Movement allowed only for free nodes except load/support nodes.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress reduced to 8.14, well below limit 15. Total mass 25.32 < 30. Members distribute forces with no overload. Node placements form efficient load paths. No nodes overlap or duplicate. Closed truss maintained. Load direction and magnitude accounted for. Areas assigned from given discrete set fit stress and mass demands.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further movement of free nodes constrained by boundary nodes (load/support). Minimal stress achieved given current topology. Mass remains economically low. Stress signs balanced by triangulated layout. No member stress near limits suggests no over-sizing or under-sizing.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Close node_7 placement near load path optimizes stress distribution with smaller area members there. Members 6 with larger area 4 carries small stress indicating efficient sizing. Further repositioning risks increased stress or mass. Triangulation is well-balanced providing structural stiffness and low stresses. Maintaining current nodes ensures load and support positions fixed excluding redundant complexity. Minimal tensile and compressive stress values confirm good structural equilibrium without overdesign.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Maximum stress 8.14 < 15 limit, mass margin 4.7 under max 30, member areas assigned properly related to load type and force magnitude. Free nodes positioned to reduce eccentricity. No overlaps in member connections. Cross checking member stress signs consistent with compression/tension.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Verified member lengths and assigned areas correlate with stress magnitudes, e.g. member_1 length and area=3, stress -6.55; member_10 smaller area 1 carries max compressive -8.14. Total mass summation derived from member lengths × area consistent with 25.32. No overstressed members or mass excess.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Design respects all constraints, minimal max stress, efficient mass use, fixed load/support nodes unmodified. No duplicate members/nodes. Triangular mesh topology stable and optimal given constraints and input loads.
