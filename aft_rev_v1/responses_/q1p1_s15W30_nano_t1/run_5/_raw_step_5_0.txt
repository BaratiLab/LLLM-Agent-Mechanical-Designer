Load at node_3 downward-left, supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Need to reduce stresses and maintain mass limit.",\n\n    "analysis": "Members near load bearing excessive tensile/compressive stresses (members 3,4,5). The design is under-reinforced or member forces uneven. The current topology lacks triangulation and redundancy for force distribution. Added nodes and diagonal bracing near load path could reduce stress concentrations.", \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Add additional nodes between node_3 and node_2 region to create triangles for force dispersion. Increase area where needed but avoid heavy members to keep mass ≤30. Use smaller high-area values for heavily stressed members, and try adding bracing between nodes 4,5,6 or new nodes between 3-4-5-6.",\n\n    "proposal": "Add new node near (3.5,1.0) between node_3 and node_5 to improve load path. Define members connecting node_3 to new node, new node to node_5, node_5 to node_2, node_4 to new node, and node_6 node connections for triangulation. Adjust member areas lower where possible but increase for main compression/tension paths. Retain supports and load nodes unchanged.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Load at node_3 creates tensile/compressive stresses on direct horizontal members and diagonals. Introducing a node forming smaller triangles reduces effective bay length and distributes forces. Using area sizes around 2 (0.782) for diagonal bracing and 3 (1.759) or 4 (3.128) for main compression members balances stress and mass. Avoid large members >4 to keep mass controlled. Members in compression are more sensitive; ensure they have adequate area.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Areas assigned: main load path members area 4 (3.128), secondary members area 2 (0.782), small bracings 1 (0.195). Expect member lengths approximately 1-3 m, total mass ~around 25-28. Max stress should reduce to <15 by triangulation and area tuning.",\n\n    "calculation": "Mass estimate with areas and member lengths: ~25-28 <30. Stress expected to reduce with triangulated geometry and moderate areas. Member count increased by 2-3 for stability. Members are: node_1-node_3(area=3), node_3-new_node(area=2), new_node-node_5(area=2), node_5-node_2(area=4), node_4-node_2(area=3), node_3-node_4(area=2), node_4-new_node(area=2), node_4-node_6(area=2), node_5-node_6(area=2), new_node-node_6(area=1).",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Final design respects supports and load nodes fixed.
