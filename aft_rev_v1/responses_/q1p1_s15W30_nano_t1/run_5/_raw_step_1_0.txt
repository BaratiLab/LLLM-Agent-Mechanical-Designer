Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Current max stress 40.29 > 15 allowed. Mass 8.81 < 30 allowed. Need to reduce stresses, especially member_4, by redesigning truss geometry and area sizing.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has high stress in member_4 (node_1 to node_4) at 40.29, well above ±15 limit, and excessive compressive stress in member_5 (-32.23). Members have small areas on some, leading to high stress. The truss is a simple triangle with an internal node_4 vertically above node_3 at (2,1.5). Load at node_3 pulls diagonally down-left causing unstable stress distribution. To reduce max stress, improving load path with more triangulation and relocating internal nodes to reduce member span is advisable. Also, choosing larger areas for highly stressed members is beneficial. Mass limit is not restrictive, so area can increase within reason.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce member_4\'s excessive compression, add more members or relocate node_4 closer to line between supports or between load node and supports to improve force flow. Add node_5 above or beside node_3 and create additional triangular members. Keep load/support nodes fixed. Increase areas on members with high stress magnitude but balance mass. Geometry changes should reduce bending and concentrate forces in axial members.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add an additional node_5 at (4.0,1.8) above node_2 and create members: node_3-node_5 and node_4-node_5, redesigning members to distribute stresses better. Increase area of members under high stress (member_4 from area \'1\' to \'3\' and member_5 from area \'1\' to \'3\'). Keep base members from supports to load and internal nodes. Remove less effective members if needed.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 on the right side creates a second load path, providing more triangulation and helping share the load path from node_3 to node_2 and node_4 to node_2, thus reducing stress concentration on member_4. Member_4 currently suffers highest stress, increasing its area from 0.195 to 1.759 should reduce stress proportionally. Similarly, member_5 will be increased in area to reduce stress. Member_2 (node_3 to node_4) will be kept or slightly reduced area to balance mass. Added members maintain triangulation ensuring stiffness and stability per truss design principles.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Current member lengths: node_1-node_3 (2m), node_3-node_4 (1.5m vertical), node_4-node_2 (4m diagonal), node_1-node_4 (~2.5m diagonal), node_3-node_2 (4m diagonal). Adding node_5 at (4,1.8) creates new members node_3-node_5 (~2.83m) and node_4-node_5 (~2m). Calculate stress by load sharing, increased area assumptions reduce stress: stress ∝ force/area, multiplying area by ~9 reduces stress drastically. Total mass estimated as sum length × area: should remain below 30. By increasing areas moderately, total mass is ~11-14, well below limit.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths: member_1 (node_1-node_3): 2.0m; member_2 (node_3-node_4): 1.5m; member_3 (node_4-node_2): length sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-1.5)^2) = sqrt(16 + 2.25) = 4.27m; member_4 (node_1-node_4): sqrt(2^2+1.5^2)=2.5m; member_5 (node_3-node_2): ~4.47m; new member_6 (node_3-node_5): sqrt((4-2)^2+(1.8-0)^2)=2.83m; new member_7 (node_4-node_5): sqrt((4-2)^2+(1.8-1.5)^2)=2.02m. Areas assigned: member_4= \'3\' (1.759), member_5= \'3\' (1.759), members_6,7 = \'2\' (0.782), other members \'2\' or \'1\' to balance. Estimated total mass ~ (2*0.78)+(1.5*0.78)+(4.27*1.759)+(2.5*1.759)+(4.47*1.759)+(2.83*0.782)+(2.02*0.782) ≈ 1.56 + 1.17 + 7.52 + 4.4 + 7.86 + 2.21 + 1.58 = 26.3 < 30 congruent with constraints.
