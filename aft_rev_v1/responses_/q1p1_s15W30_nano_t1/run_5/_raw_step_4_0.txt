Current max stress 16.2 exceeds 15 limit; mass 41.6 exceeds 30 limit.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The current design is too heavy and overstressed mainly at member_10 (node_1 to node_5). Large cross-section areas (4) and member lengths contribute to excess mass. Nodes 5, 6, 7 and redundant members add complexity and mass without needed load transfer efficiency. The force path must be simplified and mesh refined, especially around load application node_3.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce member cross-sections in less stressed members; remove node_7 and related members to cut mass; reposition node_5 and node_6 for better triangulation and force flow; maintain support and load nodes fixed.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Redesign with simplified topology: keep nodes 1,2,3 fixed. Use 2 additional nodes for vertical and inclined triangulation below 2.2m height. Members connect in stable triangular patterns. Select areas between 2 to 3 to balance mass/stress. Remove nodes 7 and related members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "To reduce mass and stress, minimize node count while preserving triangulation for stiffness. Use moderate cross-sectional areas (area_id 2 or 3) for main members. Avoid oversizing members (area_id 4 is too large). Shorten long members (like node_4-node_2) and reposition for better force path to reduce peak stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Keep node_4 around (2.0,1.6), node_5 near (4.0,1.4), node_6 near (3.0,2.2) for triangulation. Members: #1-3 kept with optimized area. Add nodes 4,5,6 with area between 2-3. Remove unnecessary members and nodes to reduce mass and stress peaks.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Calculate member lengths and areas:\\n- node_1-node_3 length 2m, area 3 (1.759)\\n- node_3-node_4 length ~1.6m, area 2 (0.782)\\n- node_4-node_2 length ~4.0m, area 2 (0.782)\\n- node_4-node_5 length ~2.0m, area 2 (0.782)\\n- node_5-node_2 length ~2.4m, area 2 (0.782)\\n- node_3-node_5 length ~2.3m, area 2 (0.782)\\nSum mass = sum(length * area density) ~ under 30 limit\\nEstimated stresses under ±15 will be maintained due to enhanced triangulation and no oversized members.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no members exceed 15 in absolute stress, total mass under 30, and support/load nodes fixed.
