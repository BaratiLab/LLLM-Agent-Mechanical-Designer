Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Current max stress 17.08 > 15, mass 25.37 < 30, so reduce stress.",\n  "analysis": "Max compressive stress -17.08 at member_1 (node_1-node_3) exceeds limit. Current topology has a panel with two upper nodes (node_4, node_5) and a heavily stressed bottom chord member from node_1 to node_3. Members near load and supports carry high stress. Mass is below max, so area redistribution possible to lower stresses.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Option: add a new upper node near node_5 to better triangulate and balance stress. Reduce cross-section of some less stressed members, increase critical members area, reposition node_5 slightly up and right for better force paths.",\n  "proposal": "Add node_6 above and between node_4 and node_5 to create stronger triangulation, reposition node_5 slightly at (4.1, 2.0). Adjust areas: increase area of heavily stressed members (member_1 area 3), reduce area of less stressed members, remove redundant member_7 (node_4-node_5). Connect node_6 to node_4, node_5, and node_3 to better transfer forces.",\n  "reasoning": "Adding node_6 allows load redistribution, introducing stiffer upper panel reduces compressive stress on member_1. Removing member_7 decreases redundant mass. Raising node_5 helps slope members resist vertical component of the load better. Adjusting area selects from allowed discrete sets keeps stress under ±15 and total mass under 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and approximate stresses: member_1 length ≈ 2.0, area 3 → mass 3*2=6 kg, reduce stress by better triangulation. Added members approx length 0.7-1.5m with area 2 (~1.5 mass each). Expect total mass <30. Check max stress with better force paths.",\n  "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3=2.0, node_3-node_4=1.5, node_4-node_2=4.0, node_1-node_4=2.5, node_3-node_2=4.0, node_3-node_5=approx 2.24, node_4-node_5=approx 2.23, node_4-node_6=0.9, node_5-node_6= approx 0.71, node_3-node_6= approx 1.44.
