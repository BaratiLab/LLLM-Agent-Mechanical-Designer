Constraints: max stress ±15, mass ≤ 30 units. Prior structure too stressed, mass was 14.1 but max stress ~324 excessive.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current design stresses too high despite moderate mass. High stresses on members connected to node_4, node_5, node_7, indicating stress concentration and insufficient load path redundancy. Area assignments and node layout insufficient for the load. Need to reconfigure internal nodes and members to form efficient load transfer paths, reduce long slender members under high stress, and balance tension/compression. Adding diagonal bracing near load and supports, reducing member length, and using moderate cross-section sizes can help.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Remove or relocate node_7 (far right), add internal nodes near load and between supports for bracing. Member areas: use 1–3 range for strength while controlling mass. Use 3 or 4 cross-sectional areas on key tension/compression members. Avoid members with very small area that cause high stress. Node_6 can relocate nearer to load to form triangular stable substructures.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign with nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0, load node), node_4(2,3), node_5(3,2), node_6(1.5,1.5 new internal node), node_7(4.5,1.5 new internal node), node_8(3.5,0.75) new node near base for diagonal bracing. Connect members to form multiple triangles distributing load from node_3 down to supports, ensuring no member is over-stressed and mass remains under 30.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Adding nodes 6,7,8 enhances truss triangulation, prevents large bending moments. Diagonal members from node_3 to node_6 and node_3 to node_8 shorten force paths and reduce member lengths, lowering stress. Members from node_6 & node_7 to supports help distribute forces. Areas assigned from mid-range (1.759 to 3.128) balance strength and mass. Supports remain fixed.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: Use distance formula. Assign area ids for reasonable cross-sections to keep stress ≤ 15 and mass ≤ 30. Mass=sum(length × area). Members with higher force get larger area. Key diagonals use 3 or 4 area. Vertical and horizontal members use smaller area. Check stresses by simplified force path assumptions (triangular load distributions).
