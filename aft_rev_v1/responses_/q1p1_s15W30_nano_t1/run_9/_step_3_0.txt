  "preamble": "Optimize truss with given loads and supports meeting stress and mass constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 is (-10, -45°). Supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller). Constraints: max stress ±15, max mass 30. Current max stress 17.77 > 15. Mass 29.7 < 30. Need to reduce stress in highly stressed members. Currently heavy members with area indices 2, 3 mostly. Node_5 added previously improved stress but not enough.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_1 (node_1-node_3) is over-stressed in compression (-17.77). Other members low stress. Member_6 and 7 with area 3 have large mass but low stress. Possibly can reduce area there and strengthen member_1 by slightly adjusting topology or introducing a new intermediate node to reduce member_1 length and stress. Member_8 (node_1-node_4) area is very small (1), low stress. Node_5 position might be shifted or add one more node higher to create triangular bracing and reduce length and stress on member_1. Maintain node_1 and node_2 positions as supports.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try adding node_6 at about (1.0, 1.2) to introduce a brace from node_1 to node_6 and from node_6 to node_3, splitting member_1 into two shorter members. Assign smaller areas to low-stress members. Increase area for new shorter member_1 split. Reduce area on members_6/7 to reduce mass. Recalculate member lengths and assign areas to keep stress under 15.",
  
  "proposal": "Add node_6 at (1.0, 1.2). Replace member_1 by members node_1-node_6 and node_6-node_3. Reduce area of members connecting node_5 to node_2 and node_1 to node_5 to 2. Keep member from node_3 to node_5 as area 2. Reassign member areas to better balance stress and mass. Members touching high compression loaded node_3 are shortened or reinforced. This should reduce max stress below 15 and keep total mass <=30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Shortening high-stress members reduces their force demand. Introducing an intermediate node creates favorable force paths, reducing stress peaks. Reducing area of less stressed members decreases mass. Maintaining triangulation ensures stability. Area choices are from given set to meet mass and stress constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: node_1-node_6 ~ sqrt(1²+1.2²)=1.562, node_6-node_3 ~ sqrt((2-1)²+(0-1.2)²)=1.562, both shorter than node_1-node_3 (2.0). Assign area 4 (3.128) to node_1-node_6 and area 2 (0.782) to node_6-node_3 to reinforce close to load support. Reduce areas on node_5 related members to area 2 or 1 to save mass. Recalculate mass sum and ensure sum <= 30. Expected stress reduction on previously overstressed member_1 replaced by two shorter members should be significant.",
  
  "calculation": "node_1-node_6 length: 1.562, member mass = length * area_density; area 4 = 3.128, mass = 1.562 * 3.128=4.888\nnode_6-node_3 length: 1.562, area 2 =0.782, mass=1.562*0.782=1.22\nPrevious member_1 mass: length 2 * area 2=3.128, increase but expected lower stress so possible to reduce area on others.\nReduce member_6 (node_1-node_5) area 3 to 2, length ~3.605, mass=3.605*0.782=2.82 (old 6.34), mass saved ~3.5\nReduce member_7 area similarly. \nCheck total mass under 30: sum mass members ~29.8 - 3.5*2 + (4.888+1.22-3.128)=~28.3 <30 \nMax stress estimated <15 by shortening critical member and decreasing area on less stressed.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New nodes: same supports, added node_6 (1.0, 1.2)\nMembers updated: replacing member_1 by two members (node_1-node_6, node_6-node_3), reduce area on members with low stress for mass saving.\nRecalculated mass and stress estimates suggest constraints met.\nNo duplicate nodes or members.\nPositions precise.",
