  "preamble": "Optimize node 6 position and area assignments to reduce stress while meeting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress is 12.18 < 15 stress limit; total mass 24.1 < 30 max mass. Node_6 is movable; areas vary from 1 to 4.",
  "analysis": "Max stress occurs on member_4 (node_5-node_4) at 12.18 and member_7 (node_5-node_2) at 11.5, close to upper limit. Node_6 at (1.0,1.2) with a relatively large area member_1 (area=4) but zero stress suggests inefficient sizing and placement. Stress in members near node_6 is compressive and high in member_2 (-9.03). Member_7 and member_4 are high tension. Member_6 and member_7 connected to node_5 have moderate tensile stress. Node_5 coordinates fixed relative to node_4 and node_2, but node_6 is movable and can improve load distribution by shifting to reduce bending and redistribute forces. Current design has no duplicated members, load/support nodes fixed as required, and total mass within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Lower the area of member_1 from 4 to 3 or 2 to reduce mass and possibly shift node_6 upward slightly to reduce stress in members 2 and 4 by improving force path. Also consider slightly rounding node_6 y-coordinate to about 1.6 to balance forces. Lower member_1 area reduces mass and stress concentration if force path is improved. Keep other areas same to maintain strength in members with medium stress. Check resultant effect on max stress. Expect better stress distribution and lower max stress with these changes.",
  "reasoning": "Moving node_6 vertically upwards towards 1.5-1.6 will reduce bending effects on members connected to it, reducing compressive stress on member_2 and tension on member_4. Reducing area of member_1 from 4 to 2 or 3 reduces unnecessary mass since stress is zero there, enabling re-balancing of forces. Remaining members keep area 2 or 3 to maintain strength for medium stresses. Keep member_8 area 1 at minimum due to lower stress. This keeps total mass below 30. This approach improves performance and lowers max stress below current max 12.18.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current areas: member_1(4), member_2(2), member_3(2), member_4(2), member_5(3), member_6(2), member_7(2), member_8(1) - mass=24.1\nTry member_1 area=3 (mass reduce by ~1 unit), node_6 y=1.55 or 1.6\nStress expected reduction on member_4 and member_7 from better force distribution\nEstimate new mass ~23.1-23.5, max stress ~10-11\nVerify constraints: stress ≤15, mass ≤30 ok\nNo changes on node_3, node_1, node_2, node_4 (load/support fixed)\nNo duplicate members, closed 2D truss still maintained",
  "calculation": "Set node_6 = (1.0, 1.6) to improve force path.\nSet member_1 area to '3' (from 4) to reduce mass and better balance.\nKeep other member areas unchanged.\nExpect new mass approx 23.1 (4.887 × 3/4 = 3.66) plus others unchanged.\nExpected max stress reduced from 12.18 to about 10-11 by geometry refinement.\nClosed truss structure intact: members connect nodes forming multiple triangles: node_1-node_6-node_3, node_5-node_4-node_2, connected via node_5 and node_6 ensuring stability.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_6 position shifted up to 1.6, reduce member_1 area to 3 from 4 while keeping all others constant. This reduces mass and redistributes forces to lower max stress below 12 and well within 15 limit. Total mass remains below 30. All constraints met. No duplicate nodes or members. Load/support nodes fixed. Ready for next FEM iteration or stop if improved sufficiently.",
