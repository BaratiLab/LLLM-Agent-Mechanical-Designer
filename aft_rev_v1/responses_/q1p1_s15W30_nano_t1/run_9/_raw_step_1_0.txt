Current design stresses up to ~29 exceed ±15 limit. Mass (~8.7) is under 30 max, so mass is secondary for now. Node_3 at (2,0) loaded; node_4 at (2,3) elevated. Members connect nodes as a simple trapezoidal frame with diagonals. Member_3 (node_1-node_4) stress highest tensile at 29. Need to reduce stress by stiffening or redistributing load paths. Areas currently mostly 2 or 1; can try higher areas selectively or add nodes for better force paths.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current maximum tensile stress (29) on member_3 exceeds ±15 constraint. Compressive max (-13) is acceptable, others near limits. Mass is well below max, so can increase cross-sectional area on high-stress members. However, increasing area excessively adds mass, so better to add a vertical intermediate node between node_1 and node_4 to better distribute load. Similarly, add a vertical node near node_2. Add members from these new nodes to node_3 and between themselves forming stable triangular substructures. This reduces stress concentration. Maintain load/support node positions.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_5 at (1,1.5) between node_1 and node_4 midpoint vertically; add node_6 at (5,1.5) between node_2 and node_4 midpoint vertically. New members: node_1 to node_5, node_5 to node_4, node_2 to node_6, node_6 to node_4, node_5 to node_6, node_5 to node_3, node_6 to node_3. Keep existing members that contribute but reduce area where stress low. Assign larger areas (4 or 5) to members connecting load node_3 to new nodes to reduce stress, others smaller area to save mass. Goal to bring max stress below ±15.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add two intermediate nodes at (1.0,1.5) and (5.0,1.5). Connect nodes to form triangular substructures linking load node and supports. Adjust member areas: main load-carrying diagonals with area 4 (3.128) or 5 (4.887), others area 1 (0.195) or 2 (0.782). Remove low-efficiency members if needed.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Introducing intermediate nodes reduces span lengths, lowering member forces. More triangular elements improve stability and distribute stresses. Increasing cross-sectional area on critical load path members reduces stress. Keeping mass within limit is feasible as total member length sum remains similar; selective small areas on less critical members save mass. This aligns with structural optimization principles balancing stiffness and weight.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_5 = sqrt(1² +1.5²)=1.802776. node_5-node_4=sqrt(1² +1.5²)=1.802776. node_5-node_6=sqrt(4² +0²)=4.0. node_6-node_4=sqrt(1² +1.5²)=1.802776. node_6-node_2=sqrt(1² +1.5²)=1.802776. node_5-node_3=sqrt(1² +1.5²)=1.802776. node_6-node_3=sqrt(3² +1.5²)=3.3541019.
