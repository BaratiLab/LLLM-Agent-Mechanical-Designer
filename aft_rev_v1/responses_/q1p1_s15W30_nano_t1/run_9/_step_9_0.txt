  "preamble": "Current structure meets constraints with efficient stress distribution and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Goal: minimize structure max stress (<15) and total mass (<30). Current max stress = 9.98, total mass = 19.38, well within limits.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is low (~10) and total mass moderate (~19.4). The structure is statically stable, all loads and supports fixed, and node displacement optimized within permissible constraints. The stress distribution is well balanced across members. Nodes at supports and load remain fixed, intermediate nodes are placed to maintain truss integrity and reduce member forces.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "No need to add/remove nodes or members, current configuration details redundancy and avoids stress peaks. Further stress minimization may lead to marginal mass increase or loss of stability.",
  
  "reasoning": "Since max stress is comfortably below Â±15 limit and total mass is well below 30, further minimizing stress may require redesign that risks mass increase or constraint violation. The closed truss is maintained with minimal tension/compression forcing. Intermediate nodes placement at (1.5,1.5), (3.5,0.75), (4.5,1.5) optimizes force paths effectively.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Changing intermediate nodes or area may reduce stress insignificantly but risks raising mass or causing stress peaks elsewhere. Current member area sizing (mostly 2 and 3) and node geometry provide balanced load flow. Load at node_3 fixed, supports pinned/roller fixed, so nodes at load/support cannot move.",
  
  "calculation": "Verification: max stress = 9.98 < 15, total mass = 19.38 < 30. Member stress ranges are small and within limits. No member area exceeds necessary sizing. The truss is closed and stable. No violation of constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met with good margin. The design is efficient, minimal mass, max stress low. Further optimization unlikely to bring meaningful benefit and may destabilize structure or violate constraints. Recommend stopping optimization.",
