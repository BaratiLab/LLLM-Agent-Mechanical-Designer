Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Max stress ±15, max mass 30. Current max stress >29, too high. Mass 22.8 under 30 limit. Improve stress distribution by adjusting node_6 position and member areas. Use areas from given discrete set. Avoid high stress members 2,4,7,8 in current design.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design: max tensile stress ~30 in member_2 (node_6 to node_3) and excessive stress in members 4 and 7. Member_2 stress is compressive over limit (-29.9). Mass acceptable but stress violated. Node_6 position increased from (1.0,1.2) to (1.0,1.6) increased stresses; needs repositioning. Member areas seem suboptimal, some members have too large cross-section but still high stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce member_2 stress, increase vertical height of node_6 to better resist diagonal compression, or reroute force path. Considering node_6 at ~1.2-1.3 height with optimized member areas for stress reduction. Reduce area of low-stress members to save mass. Member_2 needs larger area. Consider increasing node_6 height to 1.3 from 1.6 to balance forces and reduce stress.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Move node_6 to (1.2, 1.3) for better force path. Use higher area id 4 (3.128) for member_2 (node_6-node_3) to reduce stress. Keep member_1 (node_1-node_6) at area 3 (1.759). Lower area for members 6 and 7 (node_1-node_5 and node_5-node_2) to 1 (0.195) or 2 (0.782) to reduce mass. Maintain existing nodes and load/support nodes. Members: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 connections the same with updated areas and node_6 repositioned.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Positioning node_6 closer to load node_3 and at mid-height reduces compressive stress in member_2. Increasing member_2 area reduces stress magnitude to within limits. Reducing areas of members less stressed balances total mass. Keeping node_4 and node_5 positions maintains triangular bracing and load path.
