Constraints: max ±20 stress, mass ≤30. Areas discrete from 0 to 10. Load is tensile/compressive. Need closed truss (all nodes connected forming loop).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), all aligned on x-axis forming a base line. The load at node_3 down-left (-10 at 45°). To form a closed truss, add at least one more node above to create triangular members, reducing stresses. Supports have degrees of freedom pinned and roller at ends. We want to prevent excessive axial stresses with efficient load transfer. The horizontal and vertical component of load is approx -7.07 and -7.07 units respectively. With only 3 nodes colinear, a closed truss can’t be formed without adding nodes above base.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add one node above base line at x ~3.0 y > 0 to form triangles for closed loop. Members: base (node_1-node_2), left diagonal (node_1-new_node), right diagonal (node_2-new_node), cross member between node_3 and new_node to connect loaded node properly. This creates a 4-node closed polygon (possibly trapezoid). Select areas to keep stress ≤20 and mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Structural principle: triangulation for stiffness and load distribution. Adding above-node at (3.0, 3.5) breaks colinearity, providing load paths for both compression and tension members. Node_3 (2,0) being loaded, connect new node with node_3 and node_1, node_2 for triangulation. Calculate member lengths, estimate forces assuming linear elastic behavior and axial loads. Use simple truss static equilibrium equations in 2D: sum forces and moments zero. Estimate member forces, select areas from given catalog to keep stress ≤20 (stress = axial force / area). Mass is sum(length × area).",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assuming node_4 at (3.0, 3.5).
