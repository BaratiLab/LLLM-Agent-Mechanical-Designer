Must reduce high stresses mainly in member_9 (24.16) and member_2 (low stress), keep mass same or less.",\n  "analysis": "Current structure has small node clusters near load node_3, inducing high stress in member_9 connecting node_6 and node_5 with small area causing stress peak. Member areas partly large but some parts small. Structure is over-concentrated near node_6 with members 7,8,9, causing stress concentration. Need to redistribute forces, maybe remove node_6 and redesign members around node_3 and node_5 for better force flow.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider removing node_6 to reduce complexity, adding a new node a bit higher than node_5 to spread load path. Use diagonals to prevent bending. Adjust member cross-sections to keep under ±20 stress. Avoid smallest area (1=0.195) for critical joint members.",\n  "proposal": "Nodes: keep nodes 1,2,3 fixed; keep node_4 at (3,3.5); node_5 reposition at (3,2); add new node_6 at (2.6,2.5) to replace old node_6 for better geometry. Members: connect node_1-node_3, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_4-node_1, node_5-node_2, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_6, node_6-node_4, node_6-node_5. Choose member areas from sets aiming smaller masses for less loaded members, larger areas for high load members to keep stress ≤20.",\n  "reasoning": "Removing old node_6 avoids stress concentration. New node_6 placed to improve triangle shapes and load paths. Selected areas: mid-range (~2 or 3) for main load paths, smaller areas (1 or 2) for less load paths to limit overall mass. Diagonal members mitigate bending stresses. This layout provides better force distribution and reduces peak stresses while controlling mass under 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Used triangle side length calculations for each member and estimated axial forces based on member orientation and load direction. Verified stresses with assumed uniform linear elastic behavior. Calculated member masses as length × area coefficient.
