Mass 25.7 < 30 allowed. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed at node_1, node_2. Must improve to lower max stress by adjusting node_6 and node_7 positions and reconsider small area changes if necessary.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress occurs on member_2 (19.72) tensile, close to limit. Some members have zero stress, indicating possible inefficiencies. Node_6 and node_7 are internal nodes free to move. Members with larger areas (area_id 3 = 1.759) contribute significant mass. Balancing geometry to reduce high stress in member_2 and redistribute forces is key.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Shorten length or adjust angles of member_2 between node_3 and node_6 to reduce stress. Improve triangulation by slight adjustments. Maintain load/support node positions. Possibly raise node_6 slightly or move closer to node_3 without increasing mass excessively.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_2 sees high tensile stress due to load at node_3. Moving node_6 slightly upwards and closer horizontally to node_3 can reduce axial stress. Node_7 placement affects stress in members connected to it. Moving node_7 slightly downwards and right may help reduce stress in member_7 and distribute load better. Maintaining triangular support shapes reduces bending and helps stress distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check distance between node_3 (2,0) and node_6 (2.6, 2.8) is ~3.0; shortening that length within constraints can reduce stress. Moving node_6 around y=2.2 and x=2.3-2.5 region. Node_7 (3.6, 2.1) moved slightly down y~1.8 and right x~3.8. Cross members keep truss stiff and avoid zero stress members.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Shift node_6 from (2.6,2.8) to (2.45,2.25), reducing member_2 length by ~0.5m, expects stress decrease. Shift node_7 from (3.6,2.1) to (3.8,1.8) to redistribute forces on members 3,4,6,7. Keep existing cross members and areas. Recalculate length, mass roughly: sum member lengths * areas approx stays under 30. Member areas remain same, focus on geometry. Expect max stress drop below 19.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Updated node positions should reduce peak stress by shortening high-stress members and improving geometry. Mass remains within limit.
