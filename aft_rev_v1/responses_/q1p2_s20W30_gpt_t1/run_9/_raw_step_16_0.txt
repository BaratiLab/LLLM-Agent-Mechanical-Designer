Current max stress 31.84 > 20; mass 24.48 < 30. Refine geometry and areas to reduce member_4 stress, optimize topology.",\n  "analysis": "Max stress on member_4 = 31.84 exceeds limit. Member_4 is from node_4 (3,3.5) to node_1 (0,0), area=1 causes high stress. Adjusting area or node_4 position can reduce stress. Member_8 and member_9 stresses are also significant but within limits. Mass is acceptable, allowing area increase on critical members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on releasing high stress on member_4 by changing node_4 position and/or area. Possibly increase member_4 area, subdivide load path, or introduce a new node to redistribute load.",\n  "proposal": "Slightly raise node_4 to (3.0,4.0) to reduce axial force on member_4, keep other nodes. Increase member_4 area to 2. Add a new node_7 near (2.7,3.0) to split load path and relieve stresses in members connected to node_4 and node_6. Adjust members to connect node_7 suitably. Keep member cross sections within allowed discrete values.",\n  "reasoning": "Higher node_4 reduces compression stress in member_4. Introducing node_7 near node_6 and node_4 facilitates load redistribution. Area of member_4 increased to reduce stress below limit. Other members with moderate stresses kept or slightly area adjusted. Avoid large mass increases by limiting areas to minimum needed.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths for mass estimation; member areas selected conservatively to lower stress. Length(m1)=2.0 from node1-node3. Member_4 length increases from 4.3 to 5 (approx from 3,4 to 0,0). Increasing area from 1 to 2 doubles mass but halves stress. Adding node_7 creates shorter members for better force distribution.",\n  "calculation": "Member_4 original length ≈ sqrt(3^2+3.5^2)=4.61. New length ≈ sqrt(3^2+4^2)=5.0, mass = 5.0*0.782=3.91. Member_4 previous mass 0.8989 too low; area scaled. New mass increase is acceptable as total is still under 30. New members connect node_7 to node_4 and node_6 with small lengths and moderate areas to share load. Ensure max stress estimates for highest load members below 20.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify max stress < 20 and total mass < 30.
