Max stress ±20, mass ≤30. Current mass 30.9, max stress very high 140 on members 10/11 must reduce. Node_1 and node_2 fixed, can add/move others.",\n  "analysis": "Current design has local stress concentration in members 10 and 11 near node_7 and node_5. These members have tiny areas causing high stress. Member_8 also has high compressive stress. Design is close to mass limit but violates max stress by a large margin. Need to redistribute forces, possibly reduce long slender elements carrying high load and increase area or change topology to avoid large forces in small members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on removing nodes causing stress concentration (node_7) or repositioning. Member areas must be larger in high load paths. Consider triangular bracing directly from load node_3 to supports to bypass node_7. Avoid long slender members with small areas. Simplify topology to reduce complexity.",\n  "proposal": "Remove node_7. Reposition node_6 slightly higher to provide direct bracing from node_3 to node_4 and node_5. Use stronger areas (4 or 5) for critical members between node_3 to node_5, node_5 to node_2, and node_4 to node_1 to reduce stress. Add member from node_3 to node_4 directly for better load path. Keep members: node_1, node_2 (supports), node_3 (load), node_4, node_5, node_6 (new intermediate). No node_7. Use area ids: mostly 3-5 for critical members, smaller areas for less loaded.",\n  "reasoning": "High stress in small area members is primary failure. Removing node_7 reduces complex stress paths. Raising node_6 height improves distribution and allows triangular truss with balanced force flow. Using areas 3-5 on main members to keep stresses ≤20. This structure with direct connections reduces bending, maximizes axial load, ensures stable load transfer, and should be under mass limit due to fewer members and optimized areas.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calc and area choice: node coords fixed for supports and load.
