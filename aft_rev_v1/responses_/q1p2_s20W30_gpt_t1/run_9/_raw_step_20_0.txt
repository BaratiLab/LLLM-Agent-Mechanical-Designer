Load on node_3 at (-10, -45 deg). Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Use existing support and load nodes. Improve current structure to reduce max stress from 40.54 > 20 to <= 20 and keep mass <= 30.",\n  "analysis": "Current design at iteration 19 exceeded max tensile stress on member_4 (40.54 > 20). Member_4 is the slender link node_3-node_5 with smallest area (1). Many members are oversized (area 3, 2), but member_4 is highly stressed. Members between load and supports are critical. No unstable geometry noticed. Need to reduce stress in member_4 by stiffening or redistributing load, and keep mass under 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member 4 half cross-section area leads to high stress. Increasing area raises mass. Introducing an intermediate node or re-routing members to reduce length or load on member_4. Body node_6 to reduce length and stress peaks. Slight adjustment node_6 around load node_3 and nodes 4 & 5 for better isostatic force flow.",\n  "proposal": "Add node_6 near node_3 and node_5 at (2.5,2.3). Connect node_3-node_6, node_6-node_5 replacing member_4. Use moderate area sizes to balance mass and stress. Keep all load/support fixed nodes. Add diagonal member node_6-node_4 for load distribution. Areas: area 3 for main members around load path; area 2 or 1 for secondary link nodes.",\n  "reasoning": "Splitting highly stressed member_4 into two members with a new node reduces individual stresses by shortening and load redistribution. Diagonal bracing node_6-node_4 adds load path reducing load on member_3-node_4 and member_4 spans. Members near support nodes kept with moderate area to avoid over mass. Using areas from allowed set maintaining geometric optimization for minimum stress concentrations.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculations: node_3 (2,0), node_5 (3,2), node_6 (2.5,2.3), node_4 (3,3.6). Length m4 replaced by node_3-node_6 ~2.5 units, node_6-node_5 ~0.64 units, node_6-node_4 ~1.5 units. Area assignments to control mass within 30. Calculate member masses and stresses accordingly, verify max stress <=20, total mass <=30. Keep node positions precise.",\n  "calculation": "Member masses: use length × area factor. Member_1: node_1-node_3 length 2.0 units area 3=1.759 mass ~3.518 correct. Member_4 split: node_3-node_6 length ~2.5 area 3=1.759 mass=4.4; node_6-node_5 length ~0.64 area 1=0.195 mass=0.124. Member_6 node_4-node_5 length 1.6 area 2=0.782 mass=1.25; member_8 node_6-node_4 length 1.5 area 2 also similar ~1.17 mass. Sum approx: remaining members low areas or unchanged. Total mass roughly 25-28 under 30. Expected max stress under 20 distributed over shorter members.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_6 coordinates and connections added to reduce member_4 stress.
