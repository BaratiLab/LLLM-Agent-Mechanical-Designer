Current max stress 47.41 exceeds ±20 limit, mass ok at 24.45 < 30. Need to reduce stress with member redesign or topology adjustment.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current high stress is mainly on member_8 (node_2 to node_1) at 47.41, which is an edge bottom chord. Other members have low to moderate stresses. The load produces bending/moment in bottom chord causing high stress. Members connecting node_3 to node_7 and node_6 show low or zero stress, indicating inefficiency. Mass is close but manageable. Introducing a vertical node under load to create a more stable load path and better triangulation can reduce member stress. Adjust member areas to distribute load. Remove or replace zero-stress members to reduce inefficiency. Avoid moving fixed/support/load nodes.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Introduce new node below node_3 to form a closer direct load path to supports, triangulate top better. Connect this new node to node_1 and node_2 with moderate area members to carry axial forces. Reduce cross section of overstressed member_8 or split it by intermediate node. Increase area on members directly carrying load. Aim member stresses below ±20.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add node_8 at (2.0, -1.5) below node_3. Create members: node_3-node_8, node_8-node_1, node_8-node_2 with appropriate areas for load transfer. Remove or reduce area of member_8 (node_2-node_1) which had high stress. Retain existing nodes and members for stability. Adjust areas within allowed set to manage mass and stress.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Adding node_8 provides a more direct load transferring path from node_3 to supports, reducing bending moment in bottom chord. Members from node_8 to supports carry axial load with lower stress. Member_8 now can be reduced or removed to reduce high stress. Triangulation improves structural stability and load path. Restrict areas to chosen set, and sum mass <30. The load direction -45° at node_3 causes combined vertical-horizontal forces which vertical node captures better.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Areas used: \'3\': 1.759, \'2\': 0.782, \'1\': 0.195, \'0\': 1 (given). Current member lengths for new node estimated for mass calculation. Node_8 at y=-1.5 keeps feasible geometry and lowers eccentricity of load. Total length additions ~ ~4-5. Total mass estimation kept <30. Calculate stresses roughly assuming axial load distribution.",\n\n  "calculation": "Length node_3-node_8 = 1.5 (vertical). node_8-node_1 = sqrt((2)^2 + (1.5)^2)=2.5 approx. node_8-node_2 = sqrt((4)^2 + (1.5)^2)=4.27 approx. Sum member lengths new ~8. Pricing areas: node_3-node_8: 3(1.759), node_8-node_1: 3(1.759), node_8-node_2: 3(1.759). Mass from new members ~ (1.5+2.5+4.27)*1.759=~14. With removal or reduction of member_8 from area \'1\'(0.195) to \'0\' (1), we offset mass. Total mass remains ~29 optimal. Stress in member_8 replaced with multiple members and thus reduced.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Proposed topology reduces bending stresses in bottom chord, converts load transfer to triangulated axial members, keeps mass within limits, and respects node constraints.
