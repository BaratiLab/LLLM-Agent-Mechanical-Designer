Total mass (34.4) exceeds max 30. Stress concentrated on members connected to node_6 and node_5 suggests redesign needed. Areas of members 7 and 9 overly large and stressed. Node_6 elevated high causing long members with high mass and stress. Structure lacks efficient load path to transfer diagonal load at node_3 to supports without overloading.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce stresses by redistributing members; add more triangulation near load node_3; reduce long members\' areas; reposition node_6 lower to shorten members; avoid direct long large-area members that cause excess mass and stress.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Modify nodes: keep existing load/support nodes. Lower node_6 from (2,4.5) to (2.6, 2.8) to reduce length of members attached. Add node_7 near (3.6,2.1) to improve triangulation near load. Remove node_5, replace by node_7 to optimize joints. Create members linking node_3, node_6, node_7, node_2, node_1, and node_4 triangulated and with optimized smaller areas where possible.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Lowering node_6 and adding node_7 reduces lever arm and member lengths, decreases stress. Replacing node_5 with node_7 closer to load path allows better load distribution and smaller member areas. Triangulation reduces stress concentration. Use small to medium area members (area_id 1-4) where possible to reduce mass but adequate to keep stress below 20. Retain pinned and roller supports as is. Member orientation aligns with load direction to resist compression/tension effectively.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Set node_6 at (2.6, 2.8), node_7 at (3.6, 2.1).
