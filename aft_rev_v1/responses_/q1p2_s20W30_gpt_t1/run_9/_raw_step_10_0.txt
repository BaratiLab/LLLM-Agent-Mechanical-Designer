Key nodes fixed: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Internal nodes node_4 and node_5 can be moved for stress balance.",\n  "analysis": "Max compressive stress is at member_1 (-19.77), close to limit. Member_2 and member_3 have moderate compressive stresses, members_4,5,6 have low tensile/compressive stresses. Mass is within limit but can be reduced by structure optimization. To reduce max stress, adjust positions of node_4 and node_5 to improve load path. Areas chosen are 2 or 3, fairly large. Potential to reduce area in low stress members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress mainly concentrated in member_1 and member_2. Node_5 location at (3,1.75) seems to create high compressive stress in member_1 and member_2. Possibly move node_5 slightly upward and node_4 slightly to spread load better. Also consider adjusting areas especially for member_3 and member_1 down to area_id \'1\' or \'0\' to reduce mass and stress.",\n  "reasoning": "Shortening members under large compression can reduce stress. Moving node_5 upward closer to node_4 (above 2 units in y) may reduce compressive stresses in member_1 and member_2 by better triangulation. Slight horizontal adjustment of node_5 near x=3.0 to balance load paths. Keep node_4 at (3.0, 3.5) to maintain vertical support. Member areas: reduce member_1 from 2 to 1 to decrease mass and stress. Member_3 mass low, can keep area 2 for safety. Member_2 remains 3 for strength on compression. Do not move nodes_1,2,3 due to load/support constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths recalculated for new node_5 approx at (3.0, 2.4).

Mass = sum(length*area density). Area densities from input: \'0\':1, \'1\':0.195, \'2\':0.782, \'3\':1.759. So mass of member_1 about 2*0.195=0.39, member_2 about 2.4*1.759=4.2 approx, member_3 about 1.1*0.782=0.86, reducing mass and potentially stress.",\n  "calculation": "Adjust node_5 from (3.0,1.75) to (3.0,2.4) upward shift 0.65.
