  "preamble": "Optimize truss for given load with stress ±20 and mass ≤30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 downward-left; supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Max stress ±20, mass ≤30. Current mass 30.9, max stress very high 140 on members 10/11 must reduce. Node_1 and node_2 fixed, can add/move others.",
  "analysis": "Current design has local stress concentration in members 10 and 11 near node_7 and node_5. These members have tiny areas causing high stress. Member_8 also has high compressive stress. Design is close to mass limit but violates max stress by a large margin. Need to redistribute forces, possibly reduce long slender elements carrying high load and increase area or change topology to avoid large forces in small members.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on removing nodes causing stress concentration (node_7) or repositioning. Member areas must be larger in high load paths. Consider triangular bracing directly from load node_3 to supports to bypass node_7. Avoid long slender members with small areas. Simplify topology to reduce complexity.",
  "proposal": "Remove node_7. Reposition node_6 slightly higher to provide direct bracing from node_3 to node_4 and node_5. Use stronger areas (4 or 5) for critical members between node_3 to node_5, node_5 to node_2, and node_4 to node_1 to reduce stress. Add member from node_3 to node_4 directly for better load path. Keep members: node_1, node_2 (supports), node_3 (load), node_4, node_5, node_6 (new intermediate). No node_7. Use area ids: mostly 3-5 for critical members, smaller areas for less loaded.",
  "reasoning": "High stress in small area members is primary failure. Removing node_7 reduces complex stress paths. Raising node_6 height improves distribution and allows triangular truss with balanced force flow. Using areas 3-5 on main members to keep stresses ≤20. This structure with direct connections reduces bending, maximizes axial load, ensures stable load transfer, and should be under mass limit due to fewer members and optimized areas.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calc and area choice: node coords fixed for supports and load. Use coordinates: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(3,3.6), node_5(3,2), node_6(2.7,3.4). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_1, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_4-node_5, node_3-node_6, node_6-node_4, node_6-node_5. Areas: node_3-node_5:4, node_5-node_2:4, node_4-node_1:5, node_1-node_3:3, node_3-node_4:3, node_4-node_5:2, node_3-node_6:3, node_6-node_4:2, node_6-node_5:1. Mass sum around ~28, stress under ±20 estimated.",

Total mass ~31.5, slightly above limit; adjust member areas. Reduce n5-n2 and n3-n5 areas to 3 to save mass. Revised total mass about 27-28.",
