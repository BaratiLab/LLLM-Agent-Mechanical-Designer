Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Max stress must be within ±20 units, total mass ≤ 30. Current max stress exceeds limits at members 5 (21.14) and 8 (-32.74).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has an overload mostly on member_5 (21.14) and member_8 (-32.74). Member_8 has low mass (1.0892) but very high compressive stress, indicating it is slender or poorly oriented. The member_5 is in tension exceeding allowable stress, though mass is low (0.1137). Total mass is close to limit (29.8). The structure topology needs improvement to better distribute stresses and avoid slender members under high compression or tension.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Potential improvements: increase area or shorten heavily stressed members, add bracing members to reduce large compressive stress, reposition node_6 for better geometry, reposition or add nodes to reduce long slender members. Use moderate area profiles (2 or 3) for critical members. Member_5 is short and highly stressed in tension; consider changing connection or increasing area. Member_8 is long with high compression stress; increase area or reroute forces.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove the member_5 (node_6-node_5) shortest but highly stressed tensile member and replace with a diagonal bracing from node_3 to node_5 with area 3 to reduce stress. Move node_6 slightly upward and to left for better force distribution at (2.4, 2.8). Maintain node_4 at (3.0, 3.6). Add member between node_6 and node_2 with area 2 for load path. Keep existing pinned and roller supports. Use area 3 for members from node_3 to node_4, node_1 to node_3 to handle compression/tension. Use area 2 for less critical members. Resulting mass should be <30 and max stress <20.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "The tensile overstressed member_5 is removed and its function taken over by a more direct diagonal from node_3 to node_5, which shortens force paths. Node_6 repositioned to improve truss geometry and reduce high compression on member_8 by slightly shortening that member. Adding member_6 to node_2 ensures load path redundancy. Using moderate areas 2 or 3 balances mass and strength. This maintains statically determinate structure with triangulation, minimizing bending and stress concentrations.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths, assign areas, estimate stresses assuming load split.
