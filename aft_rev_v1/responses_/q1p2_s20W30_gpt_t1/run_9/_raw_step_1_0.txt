Stress especially in member_2 (-10.98), member_6 (-9.4) and member_4 (7.94) are critical. Load is downward-left at node_3, inducing tension/compression in members connected to it. Node_4 can be repositioned vertically to redistribute forces and reduce peak stress. Node_3 and supports fixed.

By moving node_4 upward (~3.9-4.0 m) and right (~3.3-3.5 m), we improve force distribution in diagonal members. Reduce area of low-stress member_3 (tension 0.65) to area=\'1\' (0.195) to save mass.
