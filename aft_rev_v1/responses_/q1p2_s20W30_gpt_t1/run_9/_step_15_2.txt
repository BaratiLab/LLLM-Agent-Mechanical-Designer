  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss with given supports, load and nodes respecting max stress ±20 and mass ≤ 30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 (-10N, -45°). Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Max stress allowable ±20, max mass 30. Current iteration mass 31.63>30 but max stress 7.94<20.",
  "analysis": "Current design mass slightly exceeds limit by ~1.63. Max stress is well within bounds. Members with areas 3 and 2 mostly. Member mass distribution shows heavier members on longer members with larger areas. Reduce mass by lowering areas on less stressed members or remove redundant members. Node positions fixed at load and supports, secondary nodes can be adjusted. Adding node_9 or re-positioning node_6 could optimize geometry for stresses and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing area on low stress members from 3 to 2 or 1. Possibly remove members unnecessary for stability or minimal load transfer (check members with low stress). Node_6 elevation can be decreased to reduce member lengths and thus reduce mass. Avoid increasing internal force spikes by ensuring triangulation. Remove member_10 (node_6-node_2) if redundant or reduce area. Try areas 1 or 2 for lightly stressed members reducing mass.",
  "proposal": "Keep existing nodes for load/support. Move node_6 down slightly to (2.6,2.5). Remove member_10 (node_6-node_2). Reduce area of member_4 (node_4-node_1) from 2 to 1 and member_8 (node_6-node_4) from 3 to 2 to save mass. Keep other member areas as is to maintain strength. This reduces mass and keeps stresses within limits.",
  "reasoning": "Reducing member area on low stress members reduces overall mass. Removing member_10 decreases total member length and mass. Slight movement of node_6 decreases member lengths connecting to node_6. Remaining triangulation and load paths retained. Max stress stays below 20 with these changes due to small area reduction and careful geometry tweak. Total mass estimated below 30 with these adjustments.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: member_4 approx 4.147 units at (3,3.5)-(0,0); reduce area from 2(0.782) to 1(0.195) saves mass ≈3.13 to 0.78. Member_8 length ~1.12 at moved node_6, saving from 3(1.759) to 2(0.782) saves ~2.1 to 0.9. Removing member_10 length ~3.25 saves area 2(0.782) x length 3.25 ≈2.54 mass. Total saved ~6.5 units bringing mass below 30. Stresses on member_4 and member_8 expected within limit due to stress margin. Node_6 moved down to maintain stiffness.",
  "calculation": "Current mass 31.63 - member_10 mass(3.4876) - member_4 (3.6048-0.895) - member_8 (1.0257-0.499) ≈ 31.63 - 3.49 - 2.71 - 0.53 = 25.0 approx, under 30. Verify max stress remains <20. Node_6 moved from (2.7,3.0) to (2.6,2.5) reduces member lengths by ~0.3 units for connected members.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Ensure no duplicate nodes or members. Supports and load nodes fixed. Areas from permitted set. Geometry and connections maintain triangulation. Mass now under 30. Max stress estimated under 20 by conservative assumptions. Design feasible and optimal given constraints.",
