Load/support nodes fixed. Opportunities: reduce high compressive stress in member_8 (-18.44), member_9 (-15.73), and high tension in member_10 (12.62). Areas limited to discrete values; member_8 & 9 have small mass but high stress, suggesting small area and/or high force.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Members 8 and 9 have highest compressive stress near limit; node_7 and node_6 positions control these. Slightly adjusting node_7 upwards and node_6 slightly right/down can redistribute forces, reducing compressive stress. Member areas mostly adequate, except member_8 and member_9 use area \'2\' (0.782) which is small; increasing one area might reduce stress but increase mass. Instead, better shape optimization preferred to reduce stress. Load at node_3 fixed; supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Member_10 and 11 tension (~12.6 and ~3.6) within limits, but member_10\'s high tension can be reduced by shifting node_7 slightly left-downwards to reduce member_10 length and force. Member_4 area is 2; increasing it to 3 may reduce stress safely as it has moderate mass. Need to check mass after changes.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Plan: Move node_7 slightly upward and left to reduce member_8 and 9 compressive stress, and reduce member_10 tension. Move node_6 slightly right/down for better force balance. Change member_4 area from \'2\' to \'3\' to reduce stress safely. Keep all other areas same. Verify mass under 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Stress reduction achieved by repositioning intermediate nodes away from critical compressive members to redistribute load paths. Increasing area only for member_4 (moderate mass increase) to lower stress there helps overall. Reducing length of tension member_10 lowers tension. Area increments chosen from allowed values. Node_7 moved closer to line between node_5 and node_4 to relieve compression in member_9 and 8.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculations involve node repositioning by ~0.1-0.2 in coordinates. Node_7 moves from (2.7,3.0) to (2.55,3.15). Node_6 moves from (2.6,2.5) to (2.7,2.4). Member_4 area changes from \'2\' (0.782) to \'3\' (1.759), mass increases by length*area increment (~3.91 - 1.56 = 2.35 approx). Total mass ~28.46 + 2.35 = 30.81 exceeds limit; so slightly reduce area of less stressed member_7 or 10 from \'3\' to \'2\'. Member_7 area from \'3\' to \'2\' to reduce ~1.759 area units mass, final mass ~29.05 <30. Member_10 area \'1\' kept same (smallest).",\n  \n  "calculation": "Updated node_7 = (2.55, 3.15), node_6 = (2.7, 2.4). member_4 area \'3\', member_7 area \'2\' (0.782). Other areas unchanged. Total mass close to 29. Updated member lengths and adjusted masses accordingly. Expect max stress reduction in member_8 and 9 below 18, member_10 tension less than 12.6.
