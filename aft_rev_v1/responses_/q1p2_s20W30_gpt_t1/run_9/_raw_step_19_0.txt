Current mass 36.5 exceeds limit. Max stress 6.16 within limits. Need mass reduction. Load at node_3 only. Supports at node_1(pinned), node_2(roller).",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current design has adequate stress but excessive mass (36.5 > 30). Heavy members mostly due to member_3 (node_4-node_1) and members connected to node_4. Excessive mass from large cross-sections (area 3 = 1.759 mostly) and relatively long members. Members are overlapping in load paths creating redundant weight.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Consider removing redundant members or reducing cross-sectional areas. Possibly remove node_6 to simplify. Focus on efficient triangular substructures. Keep load-bearing members strong but reduce area where stresses are low.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Remove node_6 to reduce complexity and mass. Retain nodes: node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4, node_5. Modify connections to better distribute load and reduce maximum length or area. Assign smaller areas to lightly stressed members.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Node_6 and its members add weight and limited benefit. Keeping simpler geometry reduces member length and mass. Load at node_3 downward at 45°, so members from node_3 must resist both horizontal and vertical forces. Triangular frames between node_1, node_4, node_3 and node_3, node_5, node_2 will share load efficiently. Use smaller area (1 or 2) for low stress members and larger (3 or 4) for critical load paths.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Estimate member lengths and areas, compute approximate mass: member_length * density(area).
