Load at node_3 (-10, -45). Supports fixed. 9 members. Node_5 and Node_6 positions adjusted last iteration.",\n\n  "analysis": "Max stress concentrated in members 7 and 8 (both compressive near -15) and member 1 (also compressive ~-14). Tensile stresses are within limits. Mass is under max 30. Load causes tension/compression in diagonal members around node_3, node_5 and node_6. Current areas mostly mid-range, some large (area 3 = 1.759, area 2 = 0.782, area 1 = 0.195). Node_6 at (2.6,2.5) and node_5 at (3.0,2.0) are key in load transfer and member force distribution.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing max compressive stresses in members 7 and 8 by adjusting node_6 slightly could reduce peak compression. Possibly increase area of members under high compression (7 or 8) or redistribute forces by shifting node_6 closer to node_5 to reduce member 8 length/stress. Node_3 is load point, fixed. Node_1 and node_2 supports fixed. Minimize mass increase when reassigning areas.",\n\n  "reasoning": "To minimize stresses, relieve compression in high-stressed members by node repositioning. Members 7 (node_3-node_6) and 8 (node_6-node_4) are highly compressed, shifting node_6 upward and slightly leftward may balance forces better. Member 9 (node_6-node_5) has allowed area 1 (smallest), increasing area could help tensile stress of 10.2 but constraint is max stress not exceeded; it\'s well below max +-20. Member 1 (node1-node3) also highly compressed (-14.2). Increasing area might add to mass but helps stress. Optimal area selection to balance mass with stress reduction needed.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Try raising node_6 y from 2.5 to 2.75 and shifting x to 2.5 to reduce compression in members 7 and 8. Keep node_5 fixed at (3.0, 2.0). Check member lengths and revise areas: keep area 3 for members 2,4,5; for member 7 and 8 increase area to 3 or 4, member 1 area to 3 to reduce stress. Member 9 area can remain at 1.",\n\n  "calculation": "Node_6 adjusted to (2.5, 2.75). Members with revised areas: member_7: area 3 (1.759), member_8: area 3 (1.759), member_1: area 3 (1.759). Other members as in iteration 12. This should reduce max compressive stress near -15 to below previous max of 15.33. Total mass estimated to rise slightly but remain under 30 (previous was 27.23). Stress distribution expected to improve due to better geometry and increased cross sections.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_6 position and member areas updated to reduce max compressive stress. Structure remains closed, no load or support nodes moved, no duplicate members or nodes. Areas adhere to allowed discrete set. Mass under 30, max stress expected close to but no more than 15.
