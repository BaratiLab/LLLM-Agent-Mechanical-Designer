Current mass 49.1 > 30 max, stresses within limits but mass too high.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current design mass 49.1 exceeds max allowed 30 though max stress 3.14 < 20. Members near node_4 are heavy (areas 3 and 4). Node_4 position higher than previous iteration (3.4,3.9) increases member lengths thus mass. Member areas vary widely leading to uneven distribution. Area \'4\', \'3\', \'4\' at top node add most mass. Load at node_3 demands diagonal bracing to top node.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing node_4 height to shorten members. Use smaller areas in longer members reducing mass. Check if additional or relocated nodes can balance forces with less mass. Keep supports fixed, node_3 for load fixed. Possibly introduce node between node_2 and node_4 or node_3 and node_4 closer to reduce member length and area.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Keep nodes 1,2,3 fixed. Move node_4 slightly lower and to the right (3.1, 3.0). Add node_5 at (4.0, 1.5). Connect members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_5-node_4, node_4-node_1, node_2-node_1. Use smaller areas (1 or 2) on longer diagonals, larger where needed to keep stress low. This will shorten some members, redistribute forces, reducing mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Shorter members reduce mass. Adding node_5 creates a triangular bracing closer to load application, reducing stress and area demand on longer members. Using smaller cross sections where feasible reduces mass while respecting stress constraints. Balancing force paths by added nodes decreases eccentricities and bending.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "New nodes: node_4 at (3.1,3.0), node_5 at (4.0,1.5).
