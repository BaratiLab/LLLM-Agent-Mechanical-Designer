Current max stress 42.96 > 20 limit; mass 23.818 < 30 limit. Need to reduce peak compressive stress -42.96 in member_1.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current high compressive stress in member_1 (node_1-node_3, area 0.195). To reduce, increase cross-sectional area or add members to share load. However, increasing area on member_1 is inefficient for mass. Consider geometric changes and adding nodes/members to relieve stress and create force paths. Node_5 at (3.0, 2.4) is intermediate; members around it have moderate stress. The members connected to node_3 are highly loaded.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding diagonal members from node_3 to node_4 or one or two additional nodes above node_3 to create triangulation might decrease stress. Also, changing area assignments to better distribute forces. Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Node_4 (3.0, 3.5) can be used as upper chord anchor. Member_1 area can be decreased if load shared by new members. Aim to keep total mass < 30 better by careful area selection (favoring 2 to 4).",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add one new node (node_6) above node_3 at (2.0, 1.8). Connect node_3-node_6, node_6-node_4, node_6-node_5, with moderate area to form triangulated substructure to share stresses. Increase area on member_1 to area_id \'2\' (0.782) to manage compression, reduce area on members with low stress. Use areas scaled between 1 and 3 mainly to control mass. Also slightly adjust member areas for better load distribution preserving total mass under 30 and max stress within Â±20.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_6 creates a local triangular bracing above node_3, reducing bending and compression on member_1 by transferring forces to member_3 and new members. Increased area on critical compression member_1 reduces stress, but added node and members help prevent excessive area increase and mass growth. Areas assigned to balance load and maintain low total mass <30. By triangulation and force path shortening, stresses can be kept below limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2 m, node_3-node_6 = 1.8 m, node_6-node_4 ~ sqrt((3-2)^2+(3.5-1.8)^2)=1.86 m, node_6-node_5 ~ sqrt((3-2)^2+(2.4-1.8)^2)=1.17 m.
