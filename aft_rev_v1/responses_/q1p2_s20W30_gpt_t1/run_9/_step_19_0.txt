    "preamble": "Optimize truss to meet max mass 30 and stress ±20 under given load/supports.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress ±20, max mass 30 units. Current mass 36.5 exceeds limit. Max stress 6.16 within limits. Need mass reduction. Load at node_3 only. Supports at node_1(pinned), node_2(roller).",
    
    "analysis": "Current design has adequate stress but excessive mass (36.5 > 30). Heavy members mostly due to member_3 (node_4-node_1) and members connected to node_4. Excessive mass from large cross-sections (area 3 = 1.759 mostly) and relatively long members. Members are overlapping in load paths creating redundant weight.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "Consider removing redundant members or reducing cross-sectional areas. Possibly remove node_6 to simplify. Focus on efficient triangular substructures. Keep load-bearing members strong but reduce area where stresses are low.",
    
    "proposal": "Remove node_6 to reduce complexity and mass. Retain nodes: node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4, node_5. Modify connections to better distribute load and reduce maximum length or area. Assign smaller areas to lightly stressed members.",
    
    "reasoning": "Node_6 and its members add weight and limited benefit. Keeping simpler geometry reduces member length and mass. Load at node_3 downward at 45°, so members from node_3 must resist both horizontal and vertical forces. Triangular frames between node_1, node_4, node_3 and node_3, node_5, node_2 will share load efficiently. Use smaller area (1 or 2) for low stress members and larger (3 or 4) for critical load paths.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Estimate member lengths and areas, compute approximate mass: member_length * density(area). Use area ids from given set. Balance stress by assigning minimal necessary cross-section. Node coords chosen to optimize member lengths and force paths.",
    
    "calculation": "Node positions: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(3,3.6), node_5(3,2). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_1, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_4-node_5, node_3-node_2(added for load path). Area assignments: critical members area 3, secondary area 1 or 2. Calculate member lengths:\n"
    "L_1-3=2.0, L_3-4=3.204, L_4-1=4.5, L_3-5=2.236, L_5-2=3.162, L_4-5=1.6, L_3-2=4.0\n"
    "Mass approx = sum(L[i]*area_density[i]): member_1(2.0*1.759=3.518), member_2(3.204*1.759=5.64 approx), member_3(4.5*0.782=3.519), member_4(2.236*0.195=0.436), member_5(3.162*1.759=5.56), member_6(1.6*0.782=1.251), member_7(4.0*0.782=3.128)\n"
