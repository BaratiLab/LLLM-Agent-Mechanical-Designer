    "preamble" :  "Current 2D truss satisfies constraints with low max stress and acceptable mass.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives: minimize stress ≤ ±20, mass ≤ 30. Constraints met: max_stress=14.07<20, mass=23.658<30.",
    
    "analysis": "Current design has all nodes fixed at support/load positions. Free nodes 4,5,6 optimized for geometry and member areas set uniformly at area_id '2' (0.782). Stress distribution is well within limits without excessive mass. Members have moderate stress and mass values.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "No members exceed stress limits. Total mass is comfortably below max. Further reductions in stress could raise mass or exceed limits. Node movements cannot alter supports/load nodes, thus optimization margin is limited.",
    
    "reasoning": "Since all constraints satisfied with margin, pushing for lower max stress likely requires increasing member areas or adding members which would increase mass near or beyond constraints. Current member size selection is minimal for the existing configuration. Small geometric perturbations in free nodes give no clear further improvement given stability and stress distribution. Supports and loads fixed. Strategy is to keep current layout, uniform member areas '2' to maintain stress balance and mass. Current design represents an optimal trade-off.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Areas all assigned '2' gives member area of 0.782. With lengths and stresses as given, stress is distributed below limits. Moving node_6, node_4, or node_5 further would risk increasing stress or mass beyond constraints or reducing structural efficacy.",
    
    "calculation": "Total mass=23.658 <30, max stress=14.07 <20. All members have stress magnitude <20. Members' length and node positions are balanced. Areas chosen '2' maintain mass and stress trade-off good. No members at max stress limit, some higher stress members close to 14 but safely below 20. No nodes can be moved that are supports or loaded nodes. Altering free node positions risks worsening stress or mass.",
    "scratch_pad_final": "Design is well balanced. Member area selection (area_id=2) moderate, no member over stressed. Free nodes precise positions optimized already. Further iteration unlikely to reduce stress without violating constraints or increasing mass. Stop optimization here.",
