  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss minimizing max stress within given constraints and preserve node loads/supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress ~10.98 < 20, mass ~19.44 < 30; load applied at node_3 (-10,-45 deg); nodes 1 and 2 supports fixed; nodes 1,2 fixed; node 3 at (2,0).",
  "analysis": "Current design uses equal cross sectional areas (id '2' = 0.782) and node_4 at y=3.5. Stress especially in member_2 (-10.98), member_6 (-9.4) and member_4 (7.94) are critical. Load is downward-left at node_3, inducing tension/compression in members connected to it. Node_4 can be repositioned vertically to redistribute forces and reduce peak stress. Node_3 and supports fixed. Areas can be adjusted per member for weight and stress optimization.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Moving node_4 slightly upward and right may reduce high compressive stress in members connected to node_3; optimizing member areas: reduce area if stress low, increase if near max stress but keep mass budget; consider length changes from node movements for weight.",
  "reasoning": "As load is at node_3 down-left, members connected to node_3 experience high stress. By moving node_4 upward (~3.9-4.0 m) and right (~3.3-3.5 m), we improve force distribution in diagonal members. Reduce area of low-stress member_3 (tension 0.65) to area='1' (0.195) to save mass. Increase area of highly stressed members (e.g. member_2, member_6) from '2' (0.782) to '4' (3.128) to reduce stress below limit. This will increase mass but keep within 30 limit.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "member lengths approx: member_1 (6m), member_2 (2m), member_3 (4m), member_4 (~4.3m), member_5 (~3.5m), member_6 (~3.2m). Mass ~ sum(length * area). Increase area on critical members, decrease low-stress member area. Analyze tension/compression signs and use higher areas on members close to Â±20.",
  "calculation": "Adjust node_4 position: from (3.0,3.5) to (3.4,3.9). Update member areas: member_1:'2' (unchanged), member_2:'4' (increase to reduce stress), member_3:'1' (reduce), member_4:'4', member_5:'3' (1.759), member_6:'4'. Total mass estimated <=30. Expected max stress decreases due to increased areas and geometry.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Ensure no member area exceeds '10', no node position change on load/support nodes, no duplicates, and constraints met; if mass near 30 but stress drops significantly, proceed to next iteration or decide stop if convergence.",
