Current max stress 67.75 > 20; mass 8.89 < 30. Stress in members connecting node_3 and node_5 very high. Solution: redistribute members to form stable triangulated truss reducing stress concentration.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design weak around node_3 to node_5 (high compressive stress). Short members near load with small cross-sections causing stress spikes. Overall mass is low, so there is room for thicker members on critical elements. Node_5 is close to mid-span, causing unbalanced stress. Increase triangulation around node_3 and node_5, add node above node_3 to better distribute load. Maintain supports and load node locations. Reduce member lengths with excessive stress and increase cross-section area appropriately.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding a new node above node_3 at roughly (2.0,2.5) to create a triangular web with node_4 and node_5. Connect node_3 to new node and new node to node_4 and node_5 forming multi-triangle structure. Assign larger areas to members connecting load node (node_3) to new node and new node to load carrying members to reduce stress.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_6 at (2.0, 2.5). Remove member between node_3 and node_5. Add members node_3-node_6, node_6-node_4, and node_6-node_5. Adjust member areas prioritizing thicker areas for members under compressive stress. Keep existing support and load nodes fixed.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_6 creates more load paths and triangulation to reduce stress. Removing high-stress member node_3-node_5 eliminates weak link. Larger cross-sections on critical compression members reduce stress level.
