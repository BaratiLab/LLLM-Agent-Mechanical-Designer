Load -10 units at node_3 at -45°. Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Objective: closed truss with minimal stress and mass constraints. Need to add nodes/members forming closed loops. Max stress ±20, max mass 30 (mass from sum of length * area). Areas discrete from given set. First iteration, so no prior assumptions.",\n\n  "analysis": "The given nodes are colinear along x-axis, with load at node_3 in diagonal direction downward left. To form a closed truss and resist moment, need to introduce at least one additional node above the x-axis to create a triangle and resist moments effectively. Closed truss requires all nodes connected in a network without open ends. The area sizing impacts both mass and stress; choosing minimal areas to keep mass low, but may increase stress. Truss members will connect nodes: base (node_1 to node_2), diagonal members from new node to base nodes, and from new node to load node_3. Supports provide reaction at node_1 fixed in both directions and node_2 roller (vertical free).",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (3.5, 3.0) approx above line for triangle shape. Members: node_1 to node_4, node_2 to node_4, node_3 to node_4, node_1 to node_3, node_2 to node_3, node_1 to node_2. Try area id 1 (0.195) for base members and area id 2 (0.782) or 3 (1.759) for diagonals for improved stiffness and stress reduction. Calculate member lengths and required cross-section from stress assumptions.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Using basic truss principles, triangles provide stable closed frame. Load at node_3 creates tensile force on member toward node_1 and compressive force on member toward node_2. The node_4 above allows force redistribution reducing stresses in base members. With max stress ±20, sizing areas for low weight but adequate strength is critical. Use stress = Force/(Area * σ_allow), but since σ_allow fixed at 20, and Force derived from load and geometry, approximate forces from equilibrium considering simplest static analysis. Mass estimated as sum(length * area_id), aiming ≤ 30. For length, Euclidean distance between nodes. Choose areas from provided set. Lower areas for base to save weight, medium areas for diagonals to reduce stress.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Static equilibrium at nodes, no buckling considered. Member forces determined by resolving load along member directions. Lengths via distance formula. Areas selected iteratively: start with area_id 1 (0.195) for members with low force, area_id 3 (1.759) for high force members. Compute forces using approximate geometry and load projection: Load magnitude 10 at -45° means Fx ≈ -7.07, Fy ≈ -7.07 at node_3. Reaction forces at supports balance these. Member forces approximate from force triangles.
