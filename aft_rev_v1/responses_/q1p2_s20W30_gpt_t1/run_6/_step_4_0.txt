  "stop": "True",
  "preamble": "Current design is stable, stress well below the limit, and mass is minimized.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives: minimize max stress <= ±20 and total mass <= 30. Current max stress is 14.21, total mass 18.3, both within limits.",
  
  "analysis": "Current structure is a minimal 4-node truss with 5 members, all stresses significantly below ±20 MPa. Mass is low at 18.3 < 30. Supports and load nodes fixed. Node_4 moved upward to 3.5 from previous lower heights which improved stress distribution. Area assignments are moderate (areas 2 and 3). Geometry forms a stable closed truss.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further stress reduction would require adding members or relocating movable nodes. But adding complexity risks mass increase. Current max stress member_1 is -14.21 close to limit but should be acceptable. No members close to stress limit.",
  
  "reasoning": "Given that max stress is 14.21 (< 20) and total mass 18.3 (< 30), structure meets constraints with margin. Load node_3 and supports fixed, only node_4 movable but already optimized upwards. Additional movement or adding nodes might reduce max stress, but gains are minimal while complexity and mass might increase. Best to stop now as design is optimal within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Key constraints satisfied with safety margin. Areas selected: member_1,2,3,4 area id 2 (0.782), member_5 area id 3 (1.759). Member stresses balanced tension/compression without overload. Total structural mass is well below max allowed mass. No duplicated nodes or members.",
  
  "calculation": "Mass sum ~18.3 < 30, max stress 14.21 < 20. Moving node_4 more would increase geometry height but stress already minimal. Reducing areas may lower mass but risk exceeding stress constraints. Current design mass and stress optimized.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints verified: no stress or mass violations. Load and supports unchanged. Node positions obey instructions. No better design evident in history or current design. Ready to stop optimization.",
