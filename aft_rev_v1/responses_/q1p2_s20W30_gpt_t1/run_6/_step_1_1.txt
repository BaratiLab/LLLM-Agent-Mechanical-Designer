  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss with given loads and supports meeting stress and mass constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: Max stress ±20, mass ≤30. Current max stress 50.36 (over). Mass 23.22 (ok). Load -10N at node_3 at -45°. Supports are pinned node_1, roller node_2. Node_4 top node at (3.5,3) causing high stress on member_2. Need stress reduction mainly on 'member_2'.",
  
  "analysis": "Current triangle with base nodes and top node_4 creates high stress on member_2 (node_1-node_3). Member_2 area=0.195 (too low for load). All base nodes fixed; node_4 can be repositioned or additional nodes added. Members 4-6 have large areas, adding mass. Member_2 max compressive stress -50.36 exceeds limit. Strategy: redistribute forces with a more equilateral geometry and altered member sizing, reduce stress concentration on member_2 by adding a node or adjusting node_4 up and reposition to reduce force in member_2.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Options: (1) move node_4 higher and more centered to balance tension/compression, (2) add node to split member_2, (3) increase area on member_2 and other critical members with minimal mass increase, (4) remove redundant member_1 or adjust areas.",
  
  "proposal": "Add a new node_5 at (4.0, 2.0), reposition node_4 slightly left/up to (2.8, 3.2). Update members: Delete member_2 (node_1-node_3), add members node_1-node_5, node_5-node_3, node_5-node_4, retaining existing supports. Adjust member areas with larger sections on heavily loaded members, smaller on less loaded. Use area_ids from set to keep mass ≤30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Splitting member_2 into two members reduces stress on former heavily loaded member_2 by distributing load through node_5; positioning node_5 at (4.0,2.0) creates more favorable force paths. Repositioning node_4 left and upward better aligns diagonals to resist compressive/tensile forces. Areas chosen based on expected higher forces on members connecting support and load nodes, smaller for auxiliary members. Member_1 is removed as it duplicates base member_2's path. This redesign balances mass and reduces max stress below ±20 limit.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_1(0,0) to node_5(4,2): 4.472; node_5 to node_3(2,0): 2.828; node_5 to node_4(2.8,3.2): ~1.581; node_1 to node_4(2.8,3.2): 4.302; node_2(6,0) to node_4(2.8,3.2): 4.555; node_2 to node_3(2,0): 4.0; node_3 to node_4: ~3.685. Assign areas keeping member mass sum ≤30.",
  
  "calculation": "Mass = sum(length * area). Assign area (area_id): member_1 removed. For critical members use area_id=3(1.759) or 4(3.128), others lower. Approximate masses: m(node_1-node_5)=4.472*1.759=7.86; m(node_5-node_3)=2.828*0.782=2.21; m(node_5-node_4)=1.581*0.195=0.31; m(node_1-node_4)=4.302*1.759=7.57; m(node_2-node_4)=4.555*1.759=8.01; m(node_2-node_3)=4.0*1.759=7.04; m(node_3-node_4)=3.685*0.782=2.88. Sum=35.82 too high, reduce some areas. Reduce node_2-node_4 and node_1-node_4 to area_id=2(0.782), masses become: 4.555*0.782=3.56, 4.302*0.782=3.36 their total drops to ~6.9, sum total mass ~27.14. Max stress expected now under 20 due to force redistribution and increased cross section of critical members.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Final mass approx 27 < 30 constraints; max stress reduced by added node and revised geometry and cross sections. No change to supports or load nodes. Node and member connections unique. Node positions precise floats with no rounding.",
