The load at node_3 is large (-10 at -45°), causing significant tension and compression in intersecting members. Node_3 is on the bottom chord, adding difficulty. Node_4 and node_5 serve as intermediate nodes to redistribute forces but their positions and member sizes lead to highly overloaded members. Member areas used are low in high stress members. Additionally, member topology has some long members with low area, leading to large stresses.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stresses, reinforce highly stressed members (increase area), reposition internal nodes to better triangulate load path and shorten overloaded members, and consider additional members to distribute forces. Maintain geometry by preserving support and load nodes (node_1, node_2 fixed on base line; node_3 fixed). Avoid duplicate members or nodes. Aim for a truss shape roughly triangular or Pratt like for better force distribution.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Maintain given supports at node_1 (0,0) pinned and node_2 (6,0) roller, and load at node_3 (2,0). Add one internal node closer to node_3 and raised higher to shorten members under high stress and better triangulate force. Set node_4 near (2.8, 3.5) to form stable triangular elements. Connect members from node_1 and node_2 to node_4 and from node_3 to node_4. Increase cross-sectional areas selectively on members connected to node_3 to reduce stress. Eliminate low area members that cause extremely high stress, upgrade those members\' areas and rebalance member connectivity. Use areas mostly between 2-4 to balance stress and mass. This configuration should reduce peak stress and keep mass under 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Highly stressed member_7 (node_3-node_4) and member_2 (node_5-node_3) indicate that node_5\'s position does not help load transfer well; removing node_5 simplifies design and reduces length of stressed members. Raising node_4 closer above node_3 shortens diagonal length, reducing stress. Increasing member areas for shorter members with high axial force reduces stress considerably. Retaining a triangular brace with proper areas creates equilibrium to support diagonal load at node_3. Limiting member count reduces total mass despite area increases. This avoids sharp stress spikes seen previously.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check max stress ≈ axial force/(area*area modulus) ≤20, increasing area reduces stress linearly. Total mass calculated as sum of (member length × area). Member length computed by Euclidean distance of connected nodes. Select member areas from given discrete set. Remove node_5 to simplify and limit mass. Use node_4 at ~3.0 x , 3.5 y above base. Members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3 for triangulation. Assign moderate areas to maintain low stress and acceptable mass.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node positions: node_1=(0.0,0.0), node_2=(6.0,0.0), node_3=(2.0,0.0), node_4=(3.0,3.5). Member lengths: node_1-node_3=2.0, node_2-node_3=4.0, node_1-node_4=√(3^2+3.5^2)=4.6098, node_2-node_4=√(3^2+3.5^2)=3.6056, node_3-node_4=3.5. Select areas: node_1-node_3 and node_2-node_3 with area_id \'3\' (1.759), node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4 area_id \'4\' (3.128), node_3-node_4 area_id \'3\' (1.759). Calculate mass = sum(length × area) = (2×1.759)+(4×1.759)+(4.6098×3.128)+(3.6056×3.128)+(3.5×1.759) ≈ 3.518 +7.036 +14.408 +11.276 +6.157 = 42.395 kg too high. Reduce some areas: use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for node_1-node_3 & node_2-node_3 to lower mass and check stress. New mass= (2×0.782)+(4×0.782)+(4.6098×3.128)+(3.6056×3.128)+(3.5×1.759)= (1.564)+(3.128)+(14.408)+(11.276)+(6.157)=36.53 still above 30. Reduce node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4 areas to \'2\' (0.782): new mass= 1.564+3.128 + (4.6098×0.782) + (3.6056×0.782) +6.157=1.564+3.128+3.605+2.819+6.157=17.27, acceptable margin.
