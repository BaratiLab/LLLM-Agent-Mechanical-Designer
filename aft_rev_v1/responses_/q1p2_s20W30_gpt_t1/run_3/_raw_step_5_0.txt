Constraints consistent. Load at node_3 fixed; supports fixed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current critical stress is in member_2 (7.81 tensile) and member_1 (-6.23 compressive). Member areas: member_1 (3), member_2 (2), member_5 (3) larger; still mass is 21.87, well below limit. Node_3 and supports fixed. Node_4 can be moved to optimize geometry and reduce stresses, especially in member_2 and member_1.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_2 connects node_1 (0,0) to node_4 (3.3,4.0); high tensile. Member_1 connects node_1 to node_3 (2,0). Possibly lowering node_4 a bit or shifting horizontally reduces tensile in member_2, transferring load distribution. Keeping node_4 roughly above node_3 helps truss stabilization.",\n\n  "reasoning": "To reduce tensile stress in member_2, can try to reduce length or re-orient node_4 to a position where load paths share more evenly. Also adjusting area: member_2 currently area 2 (0.782), member_1 area 3 (1.759). Increasing member_2 stiffness slightly may reduce stress. We balance area and position for best tradeoff within mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Try moving node_4 slightly left (reduce x from 3.3 to ~3.1) and lower y from 4.0 to ~3.7; intuition: this reduces eccentricity and stress in member_2. Keep member_1, member_5 areas same or slightly adjust. Member_2 area increase from 2 to 3 may help. Check mass and stress afterwards.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node_4 proposed: x=3.12, y=3.75 (midway between prior positions). This shortens member_2 length from ~5.18 to ~4.6, reducing tensile force. Member area: member_2 area from \'2\' (0.782) to \'3\' (1.759) to reduce stress. Member_1 kept area \'3\' (1.759). Total mass approx recalculated: expect slight increase due to member_2 area increase, still under 30. Estimated max stress drops from 7.81 to ~6.5 due to better force path and stiffer member_2.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Final check: no duplicates, no changes to supports or loaded nodes\' positions. Mass under constraint. Max stress well under limit.
