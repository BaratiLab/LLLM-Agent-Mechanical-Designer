  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce stress while maintaining constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Goal: minimize max stress (currently 6.35) with total mass 26.21 under constraints max stress <= 20 and mass <= 30. Load and supports fixed. Node_4 currently at (3.3,3.8).",
  
  "analysis": "Current max stress is well below limit, indicating possibility to reduce mass or redistribute stress. Member_2 and member_1 have relatively high areas (3) and stresses are balanced. Node_4 can be moved slightly to improve force distribution. Mass is close to max but can be optimized with area adjustment or slight geometry change.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_2 and member_5 with area '3' have large mass. Possibly reducing area on less stressed members after node move. Node_4 vertical position controls geometry efficiency. Increasing height slightly may reduce stresses on bottom chord members.",
  
  "reasoning": "Move node_4 upward slightly from 3.8 to ~4.0 to elongate diagonals, improving stress distribution, still inside constraints. Maintain or reduce members area where possible. Given node_1, node_2 fixed, adjusting node_4 within reachable limits can reduce max stress further. Then area of member_2 can be reduced from 3 to 2 if stress reduces sufficiently, lowering mass.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current stresses: member_1: -6.35, member_2: 3.55, member_5: -4.25. Increasing node_4 y will increase diagonal length, reducing force per area hence reducing required area (and stress). Approximate new node_4 (3.3,4.0). Members' areas likely: member_1 (3), member_2 (2), member_3 (2), member_4 (2), member_5 (3).",
  
  "calculation": "Estimate length of member_2 with node_4 at (3.3,4.0): sqrt((6-3.3)^2 + (0-4)^2) = sqrt(2.7^2 + 4^2) = sqrt(7.29 +16) = sqrt(23.29) = 4.826m. Longer member reduces axial stress for same load. This permits reducing area from 3 to 2 on member_2, decreasing mass. Total mass after adjusting member_2 area would reduce by (8.85-4.1)=4.75 approx, new total ~21.45 < 26.2 current. Expect max stress to reduce or remain below 6.35.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Ensure no duplicate members or nodes. Maintain load/support fixed. Geometry keeps closed truss. Adjust only node_4 y coordinate. Validate all constraints: stress max < 20, mass < 30. Stop is False because optimization still feasible.",
