  "preamble": "Redesign 2D truss with better force distribution and stress control.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: reduce max stress ≤ ±20 and total mass ≤ 30. Node_1, node_2 (supports), node_3 (load) fixed; node_4 can vary. Member areas limited to discrete set. Current max stress 33.25 violates stress limit.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress at member_2 (node_1-node_4) spikes at 33.25 despite low area (0.195). Current design underutilizes areas in critical members. The low area on critical diagonals unable to resist load, causing very high stress. Member lengths suggest node_4 height affects force distribution. Need better triangulation and area allocation. Aim for balanced tension-compression members with moderate areas.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing node_4 height slightly can reduce lever arm force. Assign medium areas to main diagonals and bottom chord; reduce area on less stressed chords. Avoid too small area for heavily stressed members. Member_2 area=0.195 too low; increase. Consider adding an extra node for better force path if needed, but prefer minor repositioning as node count fixed mostly.",
  
  "proposal": "New structure: keep nodes as before, slightly raise node_4 to (3.3, 3.8) for better force angles. Adjust member areas: node_1-node_4 and node_3-node_4 as area_id 3 (1.759), increase node_1-node_3 to 3 (1.759), others area 2 (0.782). Retain members same. This balances forces better, reduces peak stress while keeping mass under 30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Load at node_3 (-10N at -45°) creates tension/compression mainly in diagonals. Increase diagonals area to handle stress decrease peak stress from ~33 to under 20. Bottom chord member_1 area increased to distribute forces better and avoid localized stress. Medium area members reduce total mass below 30 as sum lengths moderate. Higher node_4 means better inclined diagonals improving force equilibrium.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approx: m1(1-3)=2.0, m2(1-4)=~5.0, m3(2-3)=4.0, m4(2-4)=~4.8, m5(3-4)=~4.1. Area ids 3=1.759, 2=0.782. Mass approx = sum(length*area) ~ 2*1.76 + 5*1.76 + 4*0.782 + 4.8*0.782 + 4.1*1.76 ≈ 3.52+8.8+3.13+3.75+7.22=26.4 < 30, respecting mass constraint. Stress expected < 20 due to larger area on critical members.",
  
  "calculation": "Mass = 2.0*1.759 + 5.0*1.759 + 4.0*0.782 + 4.8*0.782 + 4.1*1.759 = 26.4 total < 30 allowed. Estimates show reduced peak stress in member_2 due to 1.759 area vs previous 0.195 and better geometry. Expect tensile/compressive stresses < ±20 with this layout.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Positions used precise floats (3.3, 3.8). No duplicate nodes or members. Maintained fixed nodes for support and load. Adjusted member areas per discrete sets. Triangulation pattern unchanged to keep stable design. Check assumptions with next FEM to confirm reductions in peak stress and mass within limit.",
