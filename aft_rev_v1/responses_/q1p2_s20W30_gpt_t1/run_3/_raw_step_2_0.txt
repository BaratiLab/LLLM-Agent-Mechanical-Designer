Load at node_3 (-10, -45 deg); supports fixed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Structure is a 4-node, 5-member truss with node_3 loaded and nodes_1,2 supported. Max stress is compressive ~ -7, tensile ~8. Mass is moderate. Member areas vary 2-3. Node_4 moved up and node_3 forward from iteration_0, improving stress and reducing mass. High stress in members near load and supports still exist.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider small repositioning of node_4 to balance force paths, possibly moving node_3 slightly forward within allowed range, but load/support nodes fixed. Member area redistribution could reduce stress concentration. Member_2 and member_1 have highest tensile and compressive stresses, can tweak areas around them.",\n\n  "reasoning": "To minimize max stress, change geometry to optimize force flow and reduce stress peaks. Node_4 too high might increase member_2 stress, try moderate lowering. Node_3 fixed at x=2 (load node) thus cannot move. Areas: member_2 area reduced from 2 to 1, member_1 area increased from 3 to 4 to better handle compressive load, member_5 area slightly reduced from 3 to 2. Keep closed truss shape and no new nodes.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check stress impact of moving node_4 down from 4.0 to ~3.6 to reduce tensile stress on member_2, test member areas after. Node_1 and 2 at x=0,6 unchanged. Member mass = length * area. Keep total mass <=30. Current total mass 21.94 can increase slightly to redistribute areas for stress relief.",\n\n  "calculation": "Node_4 moved to (3.4, 3.6).
