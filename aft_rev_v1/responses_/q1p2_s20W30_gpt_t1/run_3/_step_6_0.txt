  "preamble": "Current structure meets constraints with low stress and acceptable mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective is to minimize stress while keeping total mass <= 30 and max stress within Â±20. Load applied only at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 position varied in iterations, member areas adjusted from iteration history.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is low (6.25 << 20), mass is 25.8 < 30, all constraints well satisfied. Member stresses are balanced and no member is near limit. Node_4 moved closer to line from previous further right to reduce stress. Areas assigned mostly 2 or 3 correspond to moderate cross sections. No member highly overstressed or under-sized. No further benefit from moving Node_4 as it may increase max stress or mass.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further moving Node_4 would risk increasing stress or mass; further reducing mass risks stress increase beyond allowable; current balanced. Small tweaks to node_4's y (3.6 to 4.0 range) already tested. Stress distribution balanced. Member_1 remains in compression with -6.25 stress; minimal possible with current topology.",
  
  "reasoning": "With fixed load/support nodes at node_1, node_2, and node_3 fixed at (2,0), only node_4 position is modifiable. Current node_4 (3.12,3.75) yields low max stress and total mass. Reducing or increasing height or x of node_4 can increase stress in members, or force area increases leading to heavier mass. Member areas are moderate; areas higher than 3 unnecessarily increase mass; lower areas increase stress over limit. Current design maintains stress well within limits and mass comfortably below max with little margin. No alternative topology proposed as members define closed truss and spring of members from pin supports is stable.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and resulting force distributions show balanced configuration. Attempts to move node_4 upwards or downwards in past iterations resulted in either higher max stress or mass. Cross-sectional areas mostly low/moderate (2,3). Compression and tension balanced. No member close to 20 stress limit (max absolute ~6.25). No mass near 30 limit (at 25.8).",
  
  "calculation": "Total mass 25.8085 < 30, max stress 6.25 < 20. Member stresses with signs indicate stable tension and compression. Changing node_4 to (3.12,3.75) from (3.3,4) reduced max stress from ~7.8 to ~6.25. Member cross-sections balanced for stress capacity with no member excessively overdesigned. Further decreasing mass will require smaller areas increasing stresses beyond limits, thus not optimal.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify member connections unique and form closed truss. Nodes fixed at load/support except node_4 moved once. Member areas respect allowed discrete sets. Final design balanced stress and mass bottom line. No further action advised.",
