Load on node_3, supports fixed on nodes 1 & 2. Node_4 movable.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Members connected to node_4 show moderate stress up to 6.74. Area sizes vary with some large areas (3,4). Node_3 positioned close to node_1 compared to node_2. Member_1 under high compressive stress (-13.26). Reducing stress in member_1 and member_6 can lower max stress. Node_4 can be repositioned to better distribute forces. Slightly increasing length of member_1 may reduce compressive stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider repositioning node_4 upward and right to improve triangulation. Reduce area of member_5 (currently largest mass) if possible. Increase area of highly stressed members where needed selectively. Try to increase member_1 length by shifting node_3 to right if allowed, but node_3 is load node, not movable.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Only node_4 can be moved; adjusting its position to right and upward should better redistribute forces on members connected to it. Retain areas mostly unchanged to keep mass below limits; possibly reduce area in members under low stress, increase in high stress members. Member_1 compressive stress suggests member is short and stiff; lengthening via node_3 is disallowed. Instead, shifting node_4 to improve force path. The current area codes are 2,3,1; optimize by reducing excessive areas if stress low. Member_5 at area 3 is in tension 3.79, not critical but contributes to mass, possibly reduce.
