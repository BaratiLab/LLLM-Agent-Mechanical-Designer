  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to minimize max stress within mass and stress constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 13.27 < 20, total mass 17.85 < 30, so room to reduce stress or mass. Load on node_3, supports fixed on nodes 1 & 2. Node_4 movable.",
  
  "analysis": "Members connected to node_4 show moderate stress up to 6.74. Area sizes vary with some large areas (3,4). Node_3 positioned close to node_1 compared to node_2. Member_1 under high compressive stress (-13.26). Reducing stress in member_1 and member_6 can lower max stress. Node_4 can be repositioned to better distribute forces. Slightly increasing length of member_1 may reduce compressive stress.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider repositioning node_4 upward and right to improve triangulation. Reduce area of member_5 (currently largest mass) if possible. Increase area of highly stressed members where needed selectively. Try to increase member_1 length by shifting node_3 to right if allowed, but node_3 is load node, not movable.",
  
  "reasoning": "Only node_4 can be moved; adjusting its position to right and upward should better redistribute forces on members connected to it. Retain areas mostly unchanged to keep mass below limits; possibly reduce area in members under low stress, increase in high stress members. Member_1 compressive stress suggests member is short and stiff; lengthening via node_3 is disallowed. Instead, shifting node_4 to improve force path. The current area codes are 2,3,1; optimize by reducing excessive areas if stress low. Member_5 at area 3 is in tension 3.79, not critical but contributes to mass, possibly reduce. Check mass if areas changed.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: \nmember_1: node_1(0,0) to node_3(2,0) = 2.0\nmember_3: node_2(6,0) to node_1(0,0) = 6.0\nmember_4: node_3(2,0) to node_4(2,2) = 2.0\nmember_6: node_4(2,2) to node_2(6,0) ~4.47\nmember_5: node_4(2,2) to node_1(0,0) ~2.83\nmember_2: node_3 to node_2 = 4.0\nMass computed as sum(length * area_scalar), current total 17.85;\nReduce area 3 (1.759) to 2 (0.782) in low stress members to reduce mass without increasing stress;\n",
  
  "calculation": "Shift node_4 from (2,2) to (3,3.0) to improve force transfer and distribute stress. Reduce areas for member_5 from '3'(1.759) to '2'(0.782) since stress is only 3.79 tension.\nMaintain or slightly increase area of member_1 and member_6 which have higher stresses.\nAdjust member_4 area from '3' to '2' to reduce mass, stress is moderate (-4.02). Member_1 and member_6 remain at current or one level up area if mass budget permits.\nRecalculate total mass approximately:\nLengths: m1=2, m2=4, m3=6, m4~3.16 (from (2,0)-(3,3)), m5~3.6, m6~3.6;\nAreas final: m1=2(0.782), m2=2(0.782), m3=1(0.195), m4=2(0.782), m5=2(0.782), m6=2(0.782)\nMass approx= 2*0.782 + 4*0.782 + 6*0.195 +3.16*0.782 +3.6*0.782 +3.6*0.782 = \n1.56 +3.13 +1.17 +2.47 +2.82 + 2.82 = 13.97 < 30 (mass OK)\nThis reduces mass and should keep stress acceptable.\n",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 shifted to (3,3) to balance stress. Reduced areas in members with low stress, kept moderate areas in high stress members.\nMass reduced ~14, stress likely reduced <13.27, maintain constraints fulfilled.\nNo further node movement possible except node_4; other node moves disallowed.\nFurther stress reduction limited by load and supports.\nStop flag remains False to allow further iterations if needed.",
