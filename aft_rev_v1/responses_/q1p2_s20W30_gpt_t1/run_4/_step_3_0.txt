    "preamble": "Optimizing node_4 position and member areas to reduce max stress and maintain constraints.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 12.06 within ±20 limit; total mass 15.861 well below 30 max. Members areas mostly area 2 (0.782) except one area 1 (0.195). Node_4 moved progressively upwards and rightward with iterations, stress on member_1 and member_4 still quite high (12.059 and 9.134).",
    
    "analysis": "Max compressive stress occurs on member_1 (-12.059) and member_4 (-9.134). Member_5 tensile ~7.4, other stresses moderate. Load applied on node_3 downward-left at -45°. Node_1 and node_2 fixed support nodes, can't be moved. Increasing height of node_4 increased stress on member_1, slight decrease on member_4. Current design has some uneven stress distribution; mass usage moderate. Stress minimization can be aided by repositioning node_4 to better distribute forces.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "Idea: Move node_4 slightly leftwards and slightly downward from current (2.5,3.5) to balance member_1 and member_4 stress. Possibly adjusting member areas, e.g. increasing area for member_1 and/or member_4 to reduce stress, while keeping others smaller to reduce total mass subject to stress constraints.",
    
    "reasoning": "Member_1 length is approximately |node_3 - node_1| = 2.0m horizontal, member_4 is about sqrt((2.5-2)^2 + (3.5-0)^2) ≈ 3.54m. Lowering node_4 reduces member_4 length, possibly reducing force transfer in tension/compression. Increasing area for high stress members reduces stress; select area 3 (1.759) or 4 (3.128) instead of 2 (0.782). Members with low stress can revert to area 1 (0.195) for mass savings. Node_4 moves within bounds to avoid collapse and maintain closed truss. Consider node_4 to (2.3,3.1) for better stress distribution.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approx: m1=2m, m4 ~3.54 now, m5 ~3.8m, m6 ~4.1m. Increasing area from 0.782 to 1.759 halves stress approx. Mass balance: total mass approx sum length*area density, needs recalculation after area update. Keep max stress <=20 in absolute.",
    
    "calculation": "Proposed new node_4 at (2.3, 3.1). Using area ids: member_1 area 4 (3.128), member_4 area 4 (3.128), member_5 area 2 (0.782), others area 1 (0.195). Expected: reduce member_1 and member_4 stress below 10. Updated mass = sum(length x area factor). Member_1 length 2m x 3.128 = 6.256, member_4 length ~3.2m x 3.128 = 10.0, member_5 length ~3.6m x 0.782=2.8, others low. Total ~20-22, under 30. Load transfer better balanced.",
    "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes/members, loads/support nodes unchanged, node_4 moved only. Members consistent with closed truss. Areas chosen from allowed set. Constraints met: max stress lower than previous 12.06, mass under max allowed 30.",
