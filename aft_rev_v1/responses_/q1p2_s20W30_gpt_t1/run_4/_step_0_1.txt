    "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to minimize stress and mass under given load and supports with closed topology.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given 3 nodes: node_1(0,0, pinned), node_2(6,0, roller), node_3(2,0, load -10@-45deg). Objective is minimum stress (±20) within max mass 30, closed truss, no node repositioning.",
    
    "analysis": "Current nodes collinear on x-axis row at y=0, so closed truss impossible with just these three nodes. Need to add at least one new node above/below x-axis to close a polygon. Closed means closed loop. So add node_4 above or below to form at least one triangle. Triangular truss is most efficient for stiffness and low mass. Load at node_3 is diagonal downward-left at -45°, reacting at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller; truss must transfer load safely.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "New node_4 placed above x-axis near node_3 to minimize member length and mass. Plan members: (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), (node_2-node_1), (node_3-node_4), (node_4-node_1), (node_4-node_2). All nodes connected, closed triangular polygon with node_4 top vertex.",
    
    "reasoning": "Node_4 to be placed at (2, h) above x-axis. Choose h=2.0 as small height for stiffness but short members. Triangle areas selected based on max stress and mass constraints. Assume linear member stress from load along truss. For lengths, calculate Euclidean distances. Estimate forces by simple static equilibrium. Assign small cross-sections to members under less stress. Larger cross-section for high-force members but keep total mass < 30. Areas from available set. Member stress approximated using F = σ*A; sigma ≤ ±20. Balance member forces to keep stresses within limits. Mass = sum(length*area).",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members behave axially, truss pin-jointed, load axial force distributed in triangle members, stress = force/area. Load -10 N at 45°. Calculate forces in members by sections and equilibrium. Lengths by distance formula. Mass sum member length × area ≤ 30. Stresses ≤ ±20.",
