  "preamble": "Redesign 2D truss to ensure member stresses within ±20 and total mass ≤ 30 under given loading and supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load is -10 at node_3 (-45°). Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Need to reduce max stress from 324 to ≤20. Current mass 16.4 < 30. Areas used mostly 1 or 2. Node_6 causes overstress (member_12: area 1, stress 324+).",
  
  "analysis": "Stress over-limit at member_12 and member_9, member_11. Current topology adds node_6 causing high stress. Previous simpler trusses had lower mass but high stress. Node_6 not effective; likely too small member area and poor load path. Need support load path for applied force at node_3, better triangulation, and member sizing distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_6 to avoid local stress concentration. Increase area in critical members near node_3 and node_5. Keep node_5 for vertical support. Check geometry for triangular sub-structures ensuring good force flow. Increase area for members under large stress but keep weight in check.",

  "proposal": "Remove node_6. Use nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_5 (2,2.5). Members: node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_2 (bottom chord), node_1-node_5, node_2-node_5, node_3-node_5. Use larger areas near node_3 and node_5 to reduce stress. Use area IDs 4, 3, 2, 1 for members with higher stress, lighter for others.",

  "reasoning": "Removing node_6 removes overloaded member_12. Triangulation with node_5 and bottom chord should provide good load transfer. Increasing areas on members near load and support will reduce stress well below 20. Total mass kept ≤30 by selecting area IDs carefully and avoiding unnecessary members.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0m, node_2-node_3=4.0m, node_1-node_2=6.0m, node_1-node_5=2.5m, node_2-node_5 approx sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-2.5)^2) = sqrt(16 + 6.25) = sqrt(22.25)=4.717m, node_3-node_5=2.5m. Assign areas: node_3 connected members: area 4 (3.128), node_5 connections area 3 (1.759), and node_1-node_2 smaller area 1 (0.195). Mass sum: sum(length*area). Total expected mass approx: m = 2*3.128 + 4*1.759 + 6*0.195 ~6.256 +7.036 +1.17 = ~14.46 < 30, adequate margin.",

  "calculation": "Member stresses using larger areas for critical members reduce stress by area ratio approx 3x area for node_3 members reducing stress from ~80 to ~26, still slightly over 20. Further increase area of node_3 connected members to 5 (4.887) lowers stress to ~approx 14, safe. Check total mass with area 5: node_1-node_3 (2m*4.887=9.774), node_2-node_3(4m*4.887=19.548), node_3-node_5(2.5*1.759=4.398), sum detailed below.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Final member areas: node_1-node_3 - 5(4.887), node_2-node_3 - 5(4.887), node_1-node_2 - 1(0.195), node_1-node_5 - 3(1.759), node_2-node_5 - 3(1.759), node_3-node_5 - 2(0.782). Calculate total mass (m):\n(2*4.887)+(4*4.887)+(6*0.195)+(2.5*1.759)+(4.717*1.759)+(2.5*0.782)=9.774+19.548+1.17+4.398+8.29+1.955=approx 45.13 too heavy.
