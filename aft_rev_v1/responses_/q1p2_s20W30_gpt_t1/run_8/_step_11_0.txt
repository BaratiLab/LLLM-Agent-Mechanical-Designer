  "preamble": "Optimize node_5 position to reduce max stress while keeping mass and stresses within limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective to reduce max stress 12.47 < 20, total mass 18.03 < 30 allowed. Current stresses concentrated in member_8 (12.47, tension) and member_1(-8.35 compression). Node_5 currently at (2.48,1.37). Support nodes fixed at node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), load at node_3(2,0). Only node_5 movable.",
  "analysis": "Member_8 (node_1 to node_5) has highest tensile stress, increasing vertical height of node_5 might reduce tension in this member by better load path distribution. Member_7 and member_9 stresses moderate. Existing member areas: member_1,2 at area '3' (1.759), member_3 at '1'(0.195), members_7,8,9 at '2'(0.782). Mass balance is good, no need to reduce areas. Increasing node_5 height and adjusting horizontal position slightly can optimize force flow and reduce peak stress in member_8.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try increasing node_5 y from 1.37 to about 1.6 to 1.7 and slightly shift x from 2.48 to near 2.4–2.5 to lengthen member_8 and reduce tension, maybe reduce tensile stress to ~10. Also member_1 stress improved by slight position shift. Keep member areas fixed as current, as increasing areas will increase mass, which is acceptable but unnecessary. Ensure no overlapping or invalid member connections formed.",
  "reasoning": "Moving the free node_5 upward increases truss vertical depth, reducing bending and tension on member_8. Slight left shift aligns node_5 closer to load node_3 in x direction, improving load path. Member areas used are reasonable, no need to increase or decrease. Constraints on max stress ±20 and total mass <30 not violated, so improvements possible mainly by geometry optimization. Current max stress 12.47 is not minimal, room for improvement exists. Continue optimization for few more iterations.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Positions fixed for node_1, node_2 and node_3. Move node_5 to (2.45,1.63) as a test. Recalculate length and expected stresses qualitatively: member_8 length increases from sqrt((2.48-0)^2 + (1.37-0)^2)=~2.82 to sqrt((2.45-0)^2 + (1.63-0)^2)=~2.98. Longer member means lower stress for same force. Member_7 length changes marginally, acceptable. Member_9 length changes slightly, acceptable. Given linear stress scaling, expect tensile stress in member_8 lowered from 12.47 to ~10.5. Total mass approx unchanged. Max compressive stress will also slightly reduce as load distribution balanced.",
  "calculation": "Node_5 moved from (2.48,1.37) to (2.45,1.63). Keep member_1,2 area '3', member_3 area '1', members_7,8,9 area '2'. Estimated max stress below 12, total mass around 18. Valid closed truss with no duplicate members or nodes.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Check constraints satisfied: max stress < 20, mass < 30. Node_5 position valid and no overlap with existing. Member connections unchanged and valid. Load and support nodes fixed. Improvements small but meaningful, stop if no more gains later.",
