    "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 11.4 < 20 allowed; mass 18.47 < 30 allowed; moving only node_5 to minimize stress further.",
    
    "analysis": "Node_5 moved from (2.4,1.8) to (2.65,1.65) increased stress slightly. Stress in member_8 near limit (11.4). Need slight repositioning of node_5 to reduce stress in member_8 and member_7, potentially lowering max stress. Load and supports fixed, no member addition/removal allowed.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "Member_8 is highest tensile stress (11.405). Member_7 compressive (-9.7186). Moving node_5 slightly downhill and closer to node_3 could rebalance forces. Area IDs seem optimal with 2 and 3 mostly. Check node_5 vertical and horizontal position small changes.",
    
    "reasoning": "Reducing vertical coordinate y of node_5 decreases length of members 7 and 8, potentially reducing stress. Slight horizontal shift for better force path. Avoid moves that increase mass or stress on other members. Maintain closed truss. Maintain areas to control mass and stress balance. Target max stress reduction below current 11.4 with mass â‰¤ 30.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Try node_5 at (2.55,1.5) (slightly down and left). Length changes reduce member_8 tension. Keep areas same (member_1,2:3; 7,8,9:2 and 1 for bottom). Use areas from history. Expect marginal mass change but stress reduction. Check member forces on moved node. Calculate distance changes.",
    
    "calculation": "Current member lengths:\
    - member_7 (node_3 to node_5): sqrt((2.0-2.65)^2+(0.0-1.65)^2)=~1.75\
    - member_8 (node_1 to node_5): sqrt((0-2.65)^2+(0-1.65)^2)=~3.08\
    Moving node_5 to (2.55,1.5):\
    - member_7 length: sqrt((2.0-2.55)^2 + (0-1.5)^2) = sqrt(0.3025 + 2.25)= sqrt(2.5525) ~1.597\
    - member_8 length: sqrt((0-2.55)^2 + (0-1.5)^2) = sqrt(6.5025 + 2.25) = sqrt(8.7525) ~2.958\
    Reduction in length likely reduces stress in these members. Mass reduced slightly. Areas remain. Max stress expected to decrease below 11.4.",
    "scratch_pad_final": "Check bounds: max stress target < 11.4, current 11.405 tensile in member_8. New length shorter, reduced stress expected, mass ~same <30. No load/support changes, no duplicate nodes. Plan follows constraints and instructions.",
