Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Need to reduce max stress from 324 to ≤20. Current mass 16.4 < 30. Areas used mostly 1 or 2. Node_6 causes overstress (member_12: area 1, stress 324+).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Stress over-limit at member_12 and member_9, member_11. Current topology adds node_6 causing high stress. Previous simpler trusses had lower mass but high stress. Node_6 not effective; likely too small member area and poor load path. Need support load path for applied force at node_3, better triangulation, and member sizing distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_6 to avoid local stress concentration. Increase area in critical members near node_3 and node_5. Keep node_5 for vertical support. Check geometry for triangular sub-structures ensuring good force flow. Increase area for members under large stress but keep weight in check.",\n\n  "proposal": "Remove node_6. Use nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_5 (2,2.5). Members: node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_2 (bottom chord), node_1-node_5, node_2-node_5, node_3-node_5. Use larger areas near node_3 and node_5 to reduce stress. Use area IDs 4, 3, 2, 1 for members with higher stress, lighter for others.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Removing node_6 removes overloaded member_12. Triangulation with node_5 and bottom chord should provide good load transfer. Increasing areas on members near load and support will reduce stress well below 20. Total mass kept ≤30 by selecting area IDs carefully and avoiding unnecessary members.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0m, node_2-node_3=4.0m, node_1-node_2=6.0m, node_1-node_5=2.5m, node_2-node_5 approx sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-2.5)^2) = sqrt(16 + 6.25) = sqrt(22.25)=4.717m, node_3-node_5=2.5m.
