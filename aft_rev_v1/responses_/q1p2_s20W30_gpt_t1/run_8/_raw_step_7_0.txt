Load at node_3, supports fixed. Adjust only node_5 position for stress minimization without crossing constraints.",\n\n  "analysis": "Node_5 elevation reduced from 2.5 to 2.0 in iteration 6 to meet mass limit. Stresses still under 9.05MPa max, but member_7 and member_8 stresses are highest. Shifting node_5 horizontally and vertically may distribute stresses better and reduce peak stress further. Areas mostly at 2 (0.782) and 3 (1.759) range except member_3 at 1 (0.195). Can consider lowering some member areas to reduce mass if stresses decrease.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing compressive stress in member_7 (-9.04) and tensile stress in member_8 (8.52). Moving node_5 closer to node_3 horizontally could reduce force in these members. Also slightly increasing vertical height if mass balance allows to improve geometry. Avoid moving nodes_1,2,3 as fixed.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Member_7 connects node_3 and node_5, member_8 connects node_1 and node_5. To relieve member_7 compression, bringing node_5 closer horizontally toward node_3 (x ~ 2.2 to 2.5 range) but slightly reducing vertical from 2.0 to ~1.8 may reduce axial force vector magnitude. Member_8 tensile stress may reduce if node_5 is less offset vertically from node_1. Keep area selection at 2 for consistency and mass efficiency. Verify mass under 30 and stresses under ±20. Load is negative force (-10) at 45°, primary stress may be compressive in member_7 and tensile in member_8 consistent with current values.", \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: member_7 between node_3(2,0) to node_5(2.4,1.8) => length ~ sqrt((0.4)^2 + 1.8^2) ~ 1.844.
