Further slight stress reduction possible by repositioning node_5 to reduce tensile stress peak (member_8 stress ~10). Node_5 vertical coordinate decreased from 2.0 to 1.8 caused slight increase in stress; lowering node_5 further or shifting laterally may balance stress better.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_8 shows highest tensile stress, member_7 highest compressive. We can adjust node_5 to reduce tensile force in member_8 by shifting node_5 slightly to right and down to rebalance force paths, reducing peak stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Shifting node_5 horizontally towards node_2 reduces tensile load on member_8 and compression on member_7 by redistributing forces. A slight downward adjustment (~1.6-1.7 vertical) with horizontal shift (2.5-2.7) could reduce max tensile and compression stresses while preserving triangle closure and no duplicate members.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Keep node_5 x in [2.4,2.7] and y in [1.6,1.7]; test impact on member lengths and areas (area ids fixed per members). Mass stays below 30 as area and number of members unchanged. Load at node_3 and supports fixed, so no node movement there.",\n  \n  "calculation": "New node_5: (2.65, 1.65) Selected to symmetrically reduce tensile stress in member_8 (node_1 to node_5) and compressive stress in member_7 (node_3 to node_5). Member lengths and thus stresses expected to lower due to better load path. Keep member areas same as iteration 7 to avoid mass surge. Estimated mass approx 18.5-19, max stress < 10.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "No changes to members or areas, only node_5 position changed. Member connectivity preserved.
