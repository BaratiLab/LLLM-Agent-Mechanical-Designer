Nodes load/support fixed. Members use areas 1,2,3 with mid-range values. Node_5 movable between node_1, node_2, and node_3.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_8 at 11.3 (tension) and member_7 at -9.3 (compression). Tensile stress of member_8 is high. Node_5 position affects angles and lengths of members 7, 8, 9 and hence their stresses. Current node_5 at (2.38, 1.5) results in slightly higher tensile stress in member_8. Moving node_5 downward and slightly right might reduce tension on member_8 while keeping mass within limit.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_8 length and angle critical for tensile stress reduction; reduce vertical component by lowering node_5. Avoid increasing member_7 compressive beyond limit by not lowering too much. Member_1,2,3 fixed. Areas seem reasonable; no area change recommended due to mass limit and good stress spread.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Node_5 shifting down reduces member_8 tensile stress by decreasing length and opening angle relative to node_1. This can also balance compressive force in member_7. Node_5 x-coordinate can slightly increase to reduce bending moments. Heights below 1.5 decrease member_7 stress but risk increasing others; fine tuning needed. Aim is to keep max stress closer to ~10 or lower, well below 20 allowable.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Try node_5 y at 1.3, x at 2.45 to balance stresses. Check lengths and mass of members 7,8,9. Keep member areas same: member_1,2 area_id 3, member_3 area_id 1, members 7,8,9 area_id 2. Calculate new lengths and mass: member_7 length ~distance(node_3 to node_5), member_8 length ~distance(node_1 to node_5), member_9 length ~distance(node_2 to node_5). Mass check will be < 30 based on previous similar configurations.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node_5 at (2.45,1.3).

Member masses for area 2 (0.782): mass ~ lengthÃ—area. Mass_sum ~ current 18.2 - old member_7/8/9 mass + new masses (roughly unchanged, stays near 18).
