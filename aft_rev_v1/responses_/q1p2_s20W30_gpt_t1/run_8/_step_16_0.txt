  "preamble": "Refining node_5 to reduce max stress while keeping constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress (12.1) and mass (~18) within constraints. Node_5 near (2.35, 1.35). Members use area ids 1,2,3 with moderate stress distribution.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress focused on member_8 (12.1) and member_9 (8.7). Member_7 compression high at -9.3. Current node_5 slightly low y displacement limiting triangulation efficiency.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing node_5 vertical position might lower tension in member_8 by distributing forces. Slight horizontal shift may optimize angles and stress. Keep load/support nodes fixed.",
  
  "reasoning": "Raising node_5 upward and slightly right is expected to balance tensile forces, reducing peak stress in members 8 and 9. Area selections seem reasonable; focus on geometry optimization. Mass remains safe with minor nodal moves.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and force angles adjusted by new node_5. Expect member_8 and member_9 stress reduction by ~10%. Member_7 stress stable or slight increase but under limit.",
  
  "calculation": "Move node_5 from (2.35,1.35) to (2.42,1.55). Horizontal shift 0.07m right, vertical lift 0.2m. Lengths increase mildly for members involving node_5; mass impact negligible. Use same area settings. Expect max stress ~10-11, mass ~18.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Check no new duplicates, all members connect closed loop. Load/support node fixed. Constraints met: max stress <=20, mass <=30. Continue optimization until near iteration 25 or no improvement.",
