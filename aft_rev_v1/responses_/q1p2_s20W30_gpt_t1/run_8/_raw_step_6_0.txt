Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Current mass=38.25 >30 max. Max stress=9.04 < 20 limit. Heavy members on node_2 to node_3 (area 5) and node_1 to node_3 (area 4). Need lighter mass, keep stresses safe.",\n  "analysis": "Current structure has excessive mass mainly from high-area members (area 4 and 5). Stresses all within limit, so downsizing and slight geometry change could reduce mass. Node_5 and node_3 verticality is fixed; load and support nodes fixed. Optimize by reducing area sizes, adjusting node_5 height for better load distribution, and adding a diagonal from node_5 to node_2.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try node_5 height slightly lower to reduce member length, reduce member areas mostly to 2 or 3, remove largest area(5). Add member node_5 to node_2 to form triangle to handle load better and reduce stresses, possibly use areas 2 or 3. Maintain simple truss with 4 main nodes and 6 members max.",\n  "proposal": "Keep nodes_1,2,3 fixed. Move node_5 from (2.0,2.5) to (2.0,2.0). Members: node_1-node_3 (area 3), node_2-node_3 (area 3), node_1-node_2 (area 1), node_1-node_5 (area 2), node_3-node_5 (area 2), node_2-node_5 (area 2). This forms two triangles, reduces mass, preserves redundancy.",\n  "reasoning": "Reducing node_5 height shortens diagonal members, lowering mass. Areas lowered from 4/5 to max 3 to keep stress safely below 20. Added member_9 (node_2-node_5) improves load path, lowering peak stresses allowing lower areas. Keeping base member_3 area 1 small because it carries less load. This design optimizes load carrying with minimal mass while maintaining stresses below limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approx: node1-node3=2m, node2-node3=4m, node1-node5=2.83m, node3-node5=2.24m, node2-node5=4.47m, node1-node2=6m. Using areas: 3=1.759, 2=0.782, 1=0.195. Estimate mass = sum(length*area). Approx mass = 2*1.759 + 4*1.759 + 2.83*0.782 + 2.24*0.782 + 4.47*0.782 + 6*0.195 = (3.518+7.036) + (2.213+1.751+3.496)+1.17 = 10.554 +7.46 +1.17= 19.184 << 30 max.
