  "preamble": "Optimize nodal position of free node_5 to reduce max stress under constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 9.04 < 20 limit, total mass 18.997 < 30 limit. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Adjust only node_5 position for stress minimization without crossing constraints.",

  "analysis": "Node_5 elevation reduced from 2.5 to 2.0 in iteration 6 to meet mass limit. Stresses still under 9.05MPa max, but member_7 and member_8 stresses are highest. Shifting node_5 horizontally and vertically may distribute stresses better and reduce peak stress further. Areas mostly at 2 (0.782) and 3 (1.759) range except member_3 at 1 (0.195). Can consider lowering some member areas to reduce mass if stresses decrease.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing compressive stress in member_7 (-9.04) and tensile stress in member_8 (8.52). Moving node_5 closer to node_3 horizontally could reduce force in these members. Also slightly increasing vertical height if mass balance allows to improve geometry. Avoid moving nodes_1,2,3 as fixed.",

  "reasoning": "Member_7 connects node_3 and node_5, member_8 connects node_1 and node_5. To relieve member_7 compression, bringing node_5 closer horizontally toward node_3 (x ~ 2.2 to 2.5 range) but slightly reducing vertical from 2.0 to ~1.8 may reduce axial force vector magnitude. Member_8 tensile stress may reduce if node_5 is less offset vertically from node_1. Keep area selection at 2 for consistency and mass efficiency. Verify mass under 30 and stresses under ±20. Load is negative force (-10) at 45°, primary stress may be compressive in member_7 and tensile in member_8 consistent with current values.", 
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: member_7 between node_3(2,0) to node_5(2.4,1.8) => length ~ sqrt((0.4)^2 + 1.8^2) ~ 1.844. Member_8 node_1(0,0) to node_5 => sqrt(2.4^2 +1.8^2) = ~3.0. With area 0.782 (id 2), estimated mass member_7 ~ 1.44 (length*area), member_8 ~2.35. Adding all masses from previous iterations ~18.9 + minor changes < 30. Stress reduced estimate by geometry improvement.",

  "calculation": "Set node_5 = (2.4, 1.8). Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Member areas as iteration 6. Estimated mass ~19.0, max stress decreases from 9.04 to ~7.5MPa by geometry improving force distribution. Closed truss maintained by current members. No duplicated nodes or members. Constraints satisfied: max stress < 20, mass < 30.", 
  "scratch_pad_final": "Adjusted node_5 coordinates to reduce max stress further below 9.04 while keeping mass near 19.0. Areas unchanged to keep feasibility. Optimization can continue further if desired but improvement small and within constraints, model can continue iteration. Stop not recommended yet.",
