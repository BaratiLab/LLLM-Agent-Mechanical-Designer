Keep supports and load nodes fixed. Reduce high stress on member_1 by increasing area and slightly repositioning top node.",\n    "analysis": "Current design exceeds stress limit on member_1 (-37.66 vs -20) while total mass is within limit. Members connecting node_5 have large areas inducing high mass. Redistribution needed to balance stress and mass.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 length=2.0, original area=0.195 (id \'1\'). Increasing area to id \'3\' (1.759) reduces stress. Top node y=3.25 high; decreasing reduces member length and stress. Using triangular bracing with balanced member areas.",\n    "proposal": "Retain nodes 1,2,3 (supports and load). Adjust node_5 to (2.0, 2.2). Use area ids: \'3\' for bottom vertical members, \'2\' for diagonal members, \'1\' for base member. Member connections same as iteration_1 but with reassigned areas for stress/mass balance.",\n    "reasoning": "Shortening vertical height reduces bending and axial forces. Increased area on heavily loaded member_1 reduces stress. Using moderate area members in diagonals and base keeps mass under 30. Geometry remains stable with triangular configuration.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Areas used: \'1\'=0.195, \'2\'=0.782, \'3\'=1.759.

Stress estimated proportional to loads and areas.",\n    "calculation": "Mass: m1 and m2: 2.0*0.195*2=0.78; base m3:6.0*0.195=1.17; diagonals m7,m8,m9 ~4.3*0.782*3=~10.1 total approx; sum ~12.05 well below 30.
