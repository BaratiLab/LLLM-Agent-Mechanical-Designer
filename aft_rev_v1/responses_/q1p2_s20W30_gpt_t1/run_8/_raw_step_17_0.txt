Load at node_3, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_5 free to move, members and areas mostly stable.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress 11.18 well below 20, mass 18.28 below 30. Member areas and node positions have been finely adjusted over iterations with little recent improvement. Current structure is stable and well within constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Small recent node moves around node_5 give marginal stress changes. Further moves risk increasing stress or mass. Member areas are consistent with low stress range.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Given constraints, further optimization by moving node_5 slightly is unlikely to reduce max stress significantly without mass penalty. The structure is balanced with moderate member sizes already. Load and supports are fixed, no addition of nodes is allowed. Changes might increase stress in critical members.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress in member_8 is highest (~11.18), member_7 under compression ~-9.37, and others well below limits. Mass is modest. Current placements provide good force path distribution. Fine tuning node_5 position was previously attempted with limited gain.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node_5 position at (2.42,1.55) with member areas {3,3,1,2,2,2} yields mass 18.28 and max stress 11.18. Member lengths and stresses balanced. Further stress reduction below ~10 would require disproportionate increase in mass or redesign beyond constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Confidence that continuing optimization will have diminishing returns.
