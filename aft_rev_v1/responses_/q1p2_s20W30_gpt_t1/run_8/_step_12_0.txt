  "preamble": "Optimize the truss to further reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 10.88 < 20, mass 18.4 < 30, nodes fixed at supports/load, node_5 adjustable. Members use areas {1,2,3} mostly, length and area affect mass and stress. Goal: reduce stress further without violating constraints.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is within limits, but close member_8 tension (10.88) and member_7 compression (9.38) indicate high localized load. Node_5 moved recently to [2.45,1.63]. Further small adjustments in node_5 position could redistribute forces, reduce peak stress. Constraints allow up to 20 max stress tensile/compressive, still room to reduce stress below 10. Area distribution mostly stable and acceptable. Mass well below 30, so slight area increase possible if beneficial.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider shifting node_5 slightly downward and left/right to reduce member_8 tension and member_7 compression. Check member lengths and stresses after shift. Keep members same to maintain closed truss. Avoid area increase to limit mass increase but can consider slight increase for critical members after nodal adjustment.",
  
  "reasoning": "High stresses on members connected to node_5 and node_3 imply node_5 placement affects force distribution significantly. Moving node_5 slightly closer to node_3 horizontally might shorten compressed member_7 and reduce stress. Similarly, slightly lowering node_5 might reduce tension on member_8. Need to keep node_5 within a range that maintains closure and stability. Using precise floats for position is essential for fine tuning.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Starting with current node_5 (2.45,1.63), try moving to (2.38,1.50). Small horizontal shift to left and vertical down. Keep member areas the same for now: member_1,2 area 3; member_7,8,9 area 2; member_3 area 1. Calculate effects: ",

  "calculation": "Length member_7 = dist(node_3,node_5) approx sqrt((2-2.38)^2+(0-1.5)^2) = sqrt(0.1444+2.25)=~1.55 (shorter than before ~1.85), member_8 length similar with node_1 at (0,0) to new node_5 (2.38,1.5) is ~ sqrt(2.38^2 + 1.5^2)=2.8 (slightly shorter). Shorter member length reduces force demand assuming load constant. Estimated stress drop ~10%. New mass approx same or slightly reduced due to shorter lengths. Max stress expected to reduce below current 10.88.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Confirm no constraints violated: max stress expected ~9.5-10, mass remains ~18. Moderate improvement in max stress. Continue optimization if needed or adjust member areas minimally.",
