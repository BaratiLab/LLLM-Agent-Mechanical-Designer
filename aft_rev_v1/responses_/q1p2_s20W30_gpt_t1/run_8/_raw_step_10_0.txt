Load at node_3, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. All member areas fixed. Node_5 movable only.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_8 shows highest tensile stress (~11.89), member_7 highest compression (~-9.63). As node_5 moves, stresses in connected members shift. Reducing node_5 Y-coordinate slightly may balance stress distribution and reduce max stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Current node_5 at (2.55,1.5). Earlier iterations with node_5 near (2.4,1.8) lowered stresses but mass slightly higher. Mass is not a problem, small vertical adjustments worth testing.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Optimize position of node_5 within allowed domain to reduce peak stress. Moving node_5 closer to load node_3 horizontally may reduce lever arm effect, possibly lowering stress in members 7,8,9. Vertically, lowering node_5 slightly might reduce tension in member_8 and compression in member_7. Area selections are effective; do not alter members or areas.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and internal forces depend on geometry. Adjusting y from 1.5 to ~1.3-1.4 and x from 2.5 to ~2.45 may reduce max stress while keeping closed truss and mass constant. Keep member areas as is.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Set node_5 at (2.48, 1.37). Lengths re-calculated for members connecting node_5 and node_1, node_2, node_3.
