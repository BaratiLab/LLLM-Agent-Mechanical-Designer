Load is at node_3; supports fixed. Node_5 moved from 3.25m to 2.2m height, reduced mass and stress. Current members have varying areas (1, 2, 3).",\n  "analysis": "Stress is currently low but member_7 and member_8 near ±9, dominant stresses. Member_7 compression (-9.04), member_8 tension (8.15). To minimize stress, improve load path by adjusting node_5 position for better triangulation to reduce bending and redistribute forces. Consider slightly increasing height of node_5 to reduce force magnitudes in top chords and adjusting member areas to optimize stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try node_5 height ~2.4-2.5 for better force distribution. Reduce member_7 area to \'1\' or \'2\' to reduce mass, adjust others to keep stress under limits. Member_1 and member_2 currently area \'3\', can we reduce to \'2\' to save mass? Member_3 area \'1\' is good. Member_8 and 9 are \'2\'; check if increase helps reduce stress further.",\n  "reasoning": "Raising node_5 will increase lever arm reducing force in top chords. Member_7 and 8 are diagonals from node_3 and node_1 to node_5, adjusting areas or length affects stress. Member areas should correlate to stress magnitude, higher stress - bigger area but must keep mass low. Node_3 loaded, fixed, so improving its support via node_5 optimal placement is key. Node_5 only movable node besides fixed supports and load nodes.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Current length of member_7 (node_3 to node_5) ~2.2 vertical, horizontal zero. Increasing vertical to 2.5 raises length ~2.5m, area \'1\' member_mass decreases. Member_8 length from node_1 (0,0) to (2,2.2) ~2.97. Increasing to (2,2.5) length ~3.2m, need to recalc mass and stress. Areas chosen should balance member length and stress so mass <= 30.",\n  "calculation": "Proposed node_5: (2.0, 2.5). Member areas: member_1 and member_2 reduce area from \'3\' (1.759) to \'2\' (0.782) to save mass, stress expected to rise but initial stress negative small (-6 and -2). Keep member_3 at \'1\'. Member_7 area reduce from \'2\' (0.782) to \'1\' (0.195), member_8 and member_9 keep at \'2\' (0.782) to balance stresses. Estimated mass will stay below 30.
