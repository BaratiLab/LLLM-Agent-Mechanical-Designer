  "preamble": "Current 4-node truss with 5 members meets constraints with margin.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints are max stress ±20, mass ≤ 30; current max stress 15.07, mass 29.5092. Nodes at load and supports fixed, only node_4 movable.",
  "analysis": "Current design uses member areas mostly in ranges 2 to 4 area_id, max stress well below limit. Mass near limit but acceptable. Member_1 carries highest compressive stress near -15.07. Node_4 at (3,3) forms a stable triangle with base nodes and node_3.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing node_4 height might reduce stress in member_1 but might increase tensile stresses or reduce stiffness. Increasing area above 4 is not possible due to mass limit. Member_1 area=2 matches stress level, optimizing node_4 can help stress balance.",
  "reasoning": "To reduce stress further without increasing mass, small vertical adjustment of node_4 could redistribute forces lowering high compressive stress in member_1. However, iteration 0 already shows balance. Minimal improvement expected due to constraint tightness. Load and supports fixed. No new nodes allowed. Member connections are minimal closed loop needed.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress(member_i) ∝ Load / (Area × Length). Reducing stress means lengthening member_1 or redistributing forces. Increase member_1 length by slightly shifting node_4 horizontally toward node_1 direction to lengthen diagonal, but node_3 is fixed at (2,0), node_1 at (0,0), node_2 at (6,0). Shifting node_4 horizontally leftwards risks stability but small shift feasible. Vertical position affects member_3 and 4 stresses.",
  "calculation": "Current node_4 (3,3). Shifting node_4 to (2.8, 3.0) lengthens member_1 from sqrt(3²+2²)=~3.605 to sqrt(2.8²+3²)=~4.106, reducing stress for fixed force. Check if mass constraint met - areas unchanged. Member lengths change slightly but total mass change negligible. Stress in member_1 should drop below -15.07. Other members minimally affected. Mass remains <30.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "After moving node_4 to (2.8, 3.0) and keeping areas same, expect max stress reduced slightly. Total mass unchanged. Constraints still met. No further improvements without adding nodes or changing load/support.",
