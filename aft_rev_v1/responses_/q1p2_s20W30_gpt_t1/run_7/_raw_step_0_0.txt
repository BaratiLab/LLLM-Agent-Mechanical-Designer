Load: -10 units at 45° down-left on node_3. Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Constraints: max ±20 stress, max mass 30 (sum length*area). Areas discrete from given options. Structure must be closed and all nodes connected.",\n\n  "analysis": "To create a closed truss with only 3 nodes aligned on the x-axis is impossible; a closed truss requires at least 3 non-collinear nodes. Introduce 1 additional node above baseline to form a triangle with node_1 and node_2, as triangle is simplest stable closed truss. Node_3 lies on baseline between node_1 and node_2, under load; member connections must be designed to distribute load efficiently while respecting max stress and mass constraints. Members: edges of triangle plus brace from apex to node_3 for stiffness and load path. Assign areas to reduce stress and mass. Use simplified axial stress = Force / (Area*length), assume linear approx. Mass = Sum(area × length), where area correspond to units given. Node positions must be precise float values.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (3.0, 3.0) above baseline (x=3 midway node_1 and node_2). Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_4. Five members forming closed paths with node_3 inside truss to distribute loads. Validate mass and stress with areas chosen. Prefer small area for tension members, larger for compression if needed. Iteratively select area to keep max stress under ±20 units.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Load on node_3 is downward left diagonal (-10 at 225° in standard coords, or -45° given). Members connected to node_3 must resist this load. Triangular truss with apex at node_4 provides vertical and horizontal force components to supports. Stress in members approximated by static equilibrium: resolve forces at node_3, compute member axial forces, then calculate stress by dividing by cross-sectional area related axial force.
