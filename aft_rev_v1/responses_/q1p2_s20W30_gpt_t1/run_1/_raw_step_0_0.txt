Need closed truss, so add nodes and members forming closed shape and redistribute load efficiently.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current nodes lie on x-axis. Load at node_3 (-10N at -45°) induces tension/compression in horizontal members. To create closed truss and reduce stress, add at least one upper node between nodes 1 and 2 for a triangular/similar shape to better resist load vertically and laterally. Triangular truss is minimal closed structure for 3+ nodes. Use members connecting node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, and node_1-node_2 initially to close shape. Add one new node above node_3 to reduce bending impact and distribute stresses more evenly.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Added node_4 with y>0 between node_1 and node_2 x-wise near node_3. Connect node_4 to node_1, node_2, and node_3. This yields a trapezoidal closed structure minimizing long horizontal members under direct load treatments. Use steel member areas minimizing stress and mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Assuming linear elastic behavior and static equilibrium. Stress = Force / (Area). Force approx from equilibrium at loaded node and supports. Mass = sum(length × area). Limit max stress ±20, mass ≤30. Assign areas prioritizing smaller values for less loaded members and larger area for members expected in tension/compression from load. Vertical height node_4 set to around 2.5 to reduce bending moment and distribute forces over members. Use truss in triangle and quadrilateral for efficiency.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4: (3.0, 2.5) approx midpoint between node_1 and node_2 with some vertical offset.
