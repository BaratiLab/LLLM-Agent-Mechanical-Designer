  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss with given loads and support; stress ≤ ±20, mass ≤ 30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3, pinned at node_1, roller at node_2 fixed. Existing max stress at member_12 (105.79) excessive. Mass 26.49 under max 30 but stress far exceeds limit. Need to reduce stress by member area adjustment and topology change if required.",
  
  "analysis": "Current max stress member_12 (from node_10 to node_9) is 105.79, way above ±20 limit. Also members 7 and 11 show stress > ±20. Areas used in these members (1 or 2) insufficient. Node placement at node_10 (3.7, 2.1) close to node_8 (4, 2) and node_9 (5,1.8) causing short highly stressed members.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing stress requires redistributing load paths, adding bracing, possibly increasing area in critical members. Avoid large concentration on single member by better triangulation. Keep support and load nodes fixed. Remove node_10 (causing overstress on member_12). Use nodes 7,8,9 for bracing, maybe add a node between node_4 and node_9 for better distribution.",
  
  "proposal": "Remove node_10 and its members. Add node_11 at (3.5, 2.7) between node_4(3,2.5) and node_9(5,1.8). Connect members to create stable triangulated truss: members from node_3 to node_7, node_7 to node_11, node_11 to node_9, node_9 to node_2, node_11 to node_4, node_4 to node_2, node_7 to node_4, node_3 to node_4, node_1 to node_7, node_7 to node_3. Assign increased areas for members prone to stress over limit, keep others minimal. Focus on limiting member lengths for mass and stress control.",
  
  "reasoning": "Removing node_10 eliminates high stress member_12. Adding node_11 closer to node_4 and node_9 redistributes loads more gradually, reducing peak stresses. Triangulated patches improve stiffness and reduce bending. Areas assigned by ranking stress: higher stress members get larger area to keep stress under ±20. Lengths kept short to reduce mass impact.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths for mass: member length * area from given dictionary. Assign area index '3' for critical members (area=1.759), '2' (0.782) or below for others. Sum mass must ≤ 30. Check stress by approximate proportion: stress current * area_factor inverse. Member_12 stress 105.79 reduced by increasing area 5x would approach limit.",
  
  "calculation": "Node distances: node_3-node_7 ~1.44, node_7-node_11 ~2.06, node_11-node_9 ~1.80, node_9-node_2=1.80, node_4-node_11 ~0.54, node_4-node_2 ~3.20, node_7-node_4 ~1.50, node_3-node_4 ~2.92, node_1-node_7=1.44, node_7-node_3=2.24 approx. Member masses: length * area factor sum approx 28 < 30. Areas chosen: members near load node get area '3' or '4' (3.128) to reduce stress. Others '1' or '2' for mass optimization.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Structure topology adjusted by node removal/addition to reduce stress. Areas assigned by stress ranking. Mass under max 30. Stress expected below ±20 after area increase and load redistribution.",
