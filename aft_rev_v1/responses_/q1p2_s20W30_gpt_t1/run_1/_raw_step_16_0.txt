Max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current max stress too high (~505). Need redesign to reduce stress and maintain mass ≤30.",\n  "analysis": "Current design has excessive tensile/compressive stresses on members near node_4 and node_11, notably members 4 (-314.5), 5 (229.3), 6 (198.8), 11 (-505), contributing to failure. The mass is 25.14, under max 30, so slight increase allowed. Node layout clusters nodes 10,11,12,4,8 tightly causing high stresses and long heavy members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Avoid densely clustering multiple intermediate nodes tightly. Increase vertical height at load node for better load path. Use triangulation connecting load node to supports via two main diagonals. Simplify member connectivity to fewer, more direct members. Use smaller cross sections where forces are low, larger sections where high tensile/compressive forces. Adjust node_4 upward (2.7 to ~3.25) for stiffness and distribute stress.",\n  "proposal": "Retain support and load nodes. Add two intermediate nodes: node_7 near (1.2,1.3) and node_8 near (4.8,1.3) to form main diagonal braces. Raise node_4 vertically to ~3.25. Connect node_1 to node_7, node_7 to node_3, node_3 to node_8, node_8 to node_2. Also connect node_7-node_4, node_4-node_8, node_4-node_3. Use cross sections chosen to limit stress and mass. Remove redundant nodes and members from previous dense design to reduce stress concentration.",\n  "reasoning": "Triangular topology with intermediate nodes creating two load paths for force transfer reduces peak force on any single member. By raising node_4, effective truss height increases, reducing axial force magnitudes. Strategic members support shear and bending effects. Carefully chosen member areas respond to force demand. Avoid overlarge areas that inflate mass. The roller and pinned supports at nodes 1 and 2 fix vertical and horizontal reactions properly.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths via Euclidean distance. Calculate member forces roughly assuming axial loads in triangular arrangement. Estimate member stresses σ = Force / Area; adjust area to keep |σ| ≤ 20.
