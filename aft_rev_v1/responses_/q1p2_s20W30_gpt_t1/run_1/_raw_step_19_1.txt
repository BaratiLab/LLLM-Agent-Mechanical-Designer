Nodes node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed by supports and load. Can adjust others to optimize.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current design has large stress concentrations especially in members connected to node_4 and node_1. The structure lacks triangulation near the loaded node_3 and support node_1 causing high axial force in member_8. Members with area \'1\' are insufficient causing high stresses. Mass is acceptable so no need to reduce it. Need better load path from node_3 load to supports through stiffer members and triangulation, redistribute forces. Adding a new node upwards near node_3 can help create a truss bay to reduce member lengths and stress. Increase areas on critical members within limits. Remove redundant members with high stress and low benefit.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Plan to add a node (node_9) above node_3 at about (2.0,1.5). Connect node_3, node_9, node_4, node_7. Reduce direct member_8 (node_1 to node_4) or remove it as it sees excessive compressive stress. Use areas from 1 to 4 for main members. Keep members short with proper triangulation. Use member areas of 2 or 3 for load bearing members and 1 for lighter members. Re-assign area codes to critical members.
