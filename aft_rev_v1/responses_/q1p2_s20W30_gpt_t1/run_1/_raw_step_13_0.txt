Supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller. Current max stress very high (105.12), exceeds ±20. Mass under limit at 26.5678 but high stress indicates poor member sizing or topology. Need to reduce max stress, avoid large areas causing heavy members, and maintain stiffness.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current design has a critical overstressed member_11 between node_7(1.0,1.2) and node_10(3.0,2.3) with area 1 and stress 105.12. Member_12 from node_10 to node_9 has high stress 23.07, over limit. Several members are undersized or poorly placed causing stress concentration. The structure complexity is relatively high, but load path not optimal. Mass is relatively high for size of area 3 mostly. Node_10 close to center, might cause stress concentration. Using only a few members and slightly repositioning nodes to reduce load concentration is needed.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing node number or repositioning node_10 and node_11 might help. Simplify members around node_10 to distribute load away from critical members. Increase areas selectively but limited to max area 4 or 5 to keep mass low. Length of members must be balanced to reduce force spikes. Use diagonals to support tension/compression. Check for load path directly from loaded node_3 to supports to reduce bending moments.",\n\n    "proposal": "New design with nodes fixed at supports/load: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Add nodes 10\'(2.8,2.1), 11\'(3.8,2.0) repositioned closer to load and support. Connect with members - main diagonals from node_1 to node_3, node_3 to node_10\', node_10\' to node_11\', node_11\' to node_2 and node_2 to node_1 base, plus vertical and diagonal braces to spread load. Use areas mostly 3 or 4 for main members and 2 for braces. Avoid extremely small areas causing high stress.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Repositioning nodes closer to load and support reduces member length and stress concentration. Adding members connecting node_3 to new nodes around load spreads forces better. Using moderate areas avoids mass spike but provides better strength. The diagonal bracing is essential for shear and normal force sharing, reducing oversized elements. Node placement aims to improve force transfer in triangles and reduce bending.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Areas chosen: 3=1.759, 4=3.128, 2=0.782. Members from support to load side with areas ≥ 3 to control high stresses. Calculate member lengths and estimate forces: member_1 (0,0)-(1,1.2) ~1.56m, area 2, mass ~1.22*length. Total mass estimated ≤ 28. Max stress capped via moderate areas, member forces balanced in triangles. Few nodes limit stress risers by stiffer topology.",\n\n    "calculation": "Member lengths: \\n- member_1 node_1-node_7(1.0,1.2): length=1.56m\\n- member_2 node_7-node_3(2.0,0): length=1.56m\\n- member_3 node_3-node_10\'(2.8,2.1): length=2.29m\\n- member_4 node_10\'-node_11\'(3.8,2.0): length=1.12m\\n- member_5 node_11\'-node_9(4.5,2.0): length=0.7m\\n- member_6 node_9-node_2(6,0): length=2.09m\\n- member_7 node_4(3.0,3.2)-node_11\'(3.8,2.0): length=1.55m\\n- member_8 node_7-node_4: length=2.16m\\n- member_9 node_8(4.0,2.0)-node_4: length=1.45m\\n- member_10 node_8-node_9: length=0.5m\\n- member_11 node_7-node_10\': length=1.55m\\n- member_12 node_10\'-node_9: length=1.0m\\n- member_13 node_10\'-node_4: length=1.5m\\nAreas assigned: members under tension/compression checked, max 4 area for main load paths, others area 2 or 3.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_final": "Verified uniqueness of nodes and members, no duplicates.
