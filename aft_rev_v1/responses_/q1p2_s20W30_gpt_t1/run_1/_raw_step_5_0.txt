Current max stress 638.74 > 20, mass 19.42 < 30. Need lower stress drastically. Node_7 and node_8 placed at y=1.5, node_9 and 10 higher at y=1.5 and 3, stress very high in members around nodes 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 indicating poor force flow and oversized stress concentrations. Must redistribute members and reduce member area or add better triangulation for load paths. Keep load/support nodes fixed, can add/move intermediate nodes for better force distribution.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current design shows severe over-stressing near top nodes due to force concentration and possibly long slender members. Too large cross-sections (area id 2, 3) still yielding unacceptably high stresses. Load path is not efficient. Need to add nodes to form stable triangulated structure with direct paths from load to supports, reduce member lengths and forces by more members. Prior iterations show best mass ~10-16, stress still high around 50-60. Constraint is stress ≤ 20, so need more triangulation with smaller stress per member. Mass budget is generous at 30, can add members or increase area where needed but priority is stress.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Use 3 intermediate nodes between node_3 and top at different heights to distribute load. Connect load node_3 directly to supports with triangulated web. Use mostly area id 2 (0.782) for low mass, selective use of area id 3 or 4 where needed. Keep pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Avoid very long members. Add members so every node connects in two or three members to reduce stress concentration.",\n\n    "proposal": "Add nodes node_7 at (1.0, 1.8), node_8 at (3.0, 3.0), node_9 at (5.0, 1.8). Members: Connect node_1-node_7, node_7-node_8, node_8-node_9, node_9-node_2 triangulated with diagonals node_7-node_3, node_8-node_4 (3.0,2.5), node_9-node_4, and node_3-node_4, node_4-node_2. Selected areas mostly 2 (0.782), raising to 3 or 4 for members under highest load (node_3 to node_7, and node_4 to node_2).",\n\n    "reasoning": "Triangulation improves force distribution. Intermediate nodes break long spans reducing member lengths thus stress. Using area 2 for most keeps mass low. Critical members carrying high forces get larger area 3 or 4 to reduce stress below 20. Positions chosen to create nearly equilateral triangles about 1.8 - 3 height to equalize force paths.
