Supports at nodes 1 and 2 fixed and roller. Existing structure too heavy and stressed.",\n  "analysis": "Current design max stress 73.97 > 20 and mass 31 > 30 slightly. Several members very overstressed, especially around node_7, 9, and 10 nodes with large member sizes (area_id 3 or 4). Load transfer inefficient. Members 4, 6 have large stress with large area, members 1 & 2 have high tension/compression. Need better triangulation and shorter members, reduce high area usage where possible.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing high area members and breaking long spans into smaller triangles to spread load and reduce stress. Also reposition some internal nodes for better geometry to resolve high stress concentration. Aim for mostly area_id 2 or less for efficiency and mass reduction.",\n  "proposal": "Remove nodes 9 and 10, reposition nodes 7 and 8 closer to load node and supports with better spacing. Form two triangular bracing cells between supports and load node. Use members connecting support-node_7, node_7-node_3, node_3-node_8, node_8-node_2 forming lower chord. Upper chord formed by load node_4 above node_3 connected with node_7 and node_8 creating top chords. Avoid long diagonals and large cross members. Assign areas mostly 2 or 1 for medium load, reserve 3 for key compression members bridging node_4 to supports. This will reduce mass and lower stresses.",\n  "reasoning": "Triangular substructure with short members reduces bending and shear, improves load path for inclined force. Using proper cross-bracing reduces tensile/compressive force peaks. Keeping most areas smaller reduces mass. Node_4 elevation increased to ~3.0m for stability. Load is downward-left so node_7 and 8 repositioned for better counter-tension. Roller and pinned supports unchanged to maintain boundary conditions.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and assign area ids. Use load -10N at 45deg: Fx = -7.07 N, Fy = -7.07 N approx.
