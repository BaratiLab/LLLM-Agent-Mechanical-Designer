Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current max stress 38.78 exceeds limit, mass 16.04 within limit.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current design has stress exceeding ±20 mainly due to members connected to node_4 and node_10. Node_4 at (3.0, 3.0) and node_10 at (2.8, 2.3) cause stressed members 10 and 4 near or above 38.7. Load location and support layout fixed, so need to redistribute forces with better triangulation and member sizing. Current mass well below max, so can afford to increase areas or add members/nodes to reduce stress.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Use lower height for node_4 to reduce long compressive members; add additional nodes to form stable triangular web to distribute load more evenly; adjust area sizes strategically; avoid very long diagonal members with high stress; maintain simple stable triangulated pattern between supports and load.",\n\n    "proposal": "Add two new intermediate nodes near load and supports to create triangulated web: node_11 near mid-height between node_3 and node_4 and node_12 near node_8 but slightly lower. Reconnect members to form triangles distributing load to supports. Adjust member cross-sections with area ids mostly 2 or 3 for moderate strength. Remove overstressed members and redistribute to reduce stress below 20 and keep mass under 30.",\n\n    "reasoning": "By adding nodes 11 and 12, we improve load paths, reducing stress in critical members by shortening length and creating multiple paths. Areas 2 and 3 provide good compromise of mass and strength. Existing nodes 1,2,3 fixed for support and load. Lower height of node_4 at 2.7 to reduce compression on diagonal members. Triangulation ensures zero mechanism and better stiffness.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate approximate lengths and stresses of new members. Use area 3 mainly for load-carrying main diagonals and area 2 for secondary members. Verify that maximum tensile/compressive stresses are under 20. Estimate mass as sum(length*area_factor). Lengths mostly 1-3 units, areas 0.782 to 1.759 give mass around 20-25 < 30.",\n\n    "calculation": "Approximate member lengths: e.g. node_1-node_7 ~1.8, node_7-node_3 ~1.5, node_3-node_11 ~1.7, node_11-node_4 ~1.5, node_4-node_8 ~1.0, node_8-node_2 ~2.5, node_7-node_12 ~3.2, node_12-node_8 ~1.5, node_11-node_12 ~1.2.
