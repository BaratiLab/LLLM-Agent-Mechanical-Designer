Current max stress greatly exceeds ±20. Mass is below 30 but stress constraint fails, especially member_9 (84.72). Need to reduce stress by load path adjustment and cross bracing.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High stress on member_9 connecting node_7 to node_11 is major issue with magnitude ~85. Member_8 (node_7 to node_4) is also highly compressed (-23.67). Members around node_7, node_11, node_9 and node_4 must better triangulate load path. Current structure partially redundant but lacks efficient load path distribution. Areas mostly small; increase areas selectively or change geometry.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Areas: member_9 currently 1 (0.195 area?), might be undersized. Adding node between node_7 and node_9 or better triangulation can distribute stresses. Lengths and areas dictate mass, so adding nodes will increase mass but can reduce peak stress by load redistribution.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_12 close to centroid of node_7, node_9, node_11 (~[3.0,1.8]) to improve triangulation. Connect node_12 to node_7, node_9, node_11 with medium areas. Remove member_9 or reduce area to reduce member_9 stress by sharing load via node_12. Increase some critical member areas from 1 to 3 where stressed highly. Keep existing load/support nodes fixed. Use areas: 2 (0.782), 3 (1.759), 4 (3.128) to balance mass and strength.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "1. Peak stress arises from long member_9, short member with small area, subject to concentrated load from node_3 through node_7 to node_11 and then node_9.\\n2. By introducing intermediate node_12 and segments to it, redistribute force and reduce singular high tension in member_9.\\n3. Increase area on members bearing most load (member_4, member_6, member_7) slightly to keep stress within limits.\\n4. Use triangulation principles to stiffen structure near load and mid-span.\\n5.
