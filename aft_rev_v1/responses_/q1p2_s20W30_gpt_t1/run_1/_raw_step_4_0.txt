Current max stress 310.5 >> 20. Total mass 9.7 under limit. Stress bottleneck at member_4 (node_8-node_2). Need redesign to reduce max stress and keep mass under 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has too high stress on member_4 and member_7. Stress exceeds allowable ±20 by a large margin. Members crossing near top-right node (node_8) are overloaded. Member areas mostly small (1 or 2), unable to support applied load safely. Also, nodes 7 and 8 close horizontally at y=1.5 causing long tensile members near top-right. The loading at node_3 creates complex force paths. The structure may benefit from added triangulation and better load transfer from node_3 to supports.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Need to add intermediate node(s) between node_3 and node_2 and possibly node_4 to better distribute forces. Increase member connectivity for triangulation. Avoid long slender members with large stresses. Use larger areas only when necessary, keep mass low. Try making a vertical truss shape between node_3 and node_2 to reduce load intensity on member_4. Keep node_1 and node_2 fixed; node_3 fixed for load; others free to move or add nodes.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add two intermediate nodes: node_9 at (4.0, 3.0) and node_10 at (3.0, 1.5). Connect nodes to form a balanced triangulated truss: node_1, 7, 3, 10, 9, 8, 4, 2. Replace high-stress members with multiple shorter members with moderate areas. Member areas mostly 1 or 2, some 3 for critical load paths.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_9 higher at (4.0,3.0) and node_10 mid-level (3.0,1.5) creates more triangles to spread load. This reduces stress concentration in members between node_8 and node_2. Multiple small members instead of one large member improves force distribution. Avoid large members unless necessary to keep mass low. Node_10 splits horizontal forces between node_3 and node_8, reducing tensile stresses observed. Top nodes allow vertical load paths to supports, minimizing bending or overloading single members.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Areas selected from 0-10 as allowed. Estimate member lengths, assign area based on force demand. Keep max stress within ±20 by increasing area when needed but control total mass. Higher nodes reduce overall member lengths and distribute load better. Triangulation is fundamental principle for stable 2D trusses.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths (est.): node_1-node_7 ~1.803, node_7-node_3 ~1.803, node_3-node_10 ~1.5, node_10-node_9 ~1.803, node_9-node_8 ~1.803, node_8-node_4 ~1.803, node_4-node_2 ~3.0, node_10-node_8 ~1.5, node_7-node_4 ~2.5, node_3-node_4 ~2.5, node_8-node_2 ~2.0. Assign areas mostly 2 (0.782 in mass factor) except critical members (e.g. node_4-node_2) increased to 3 (1.759). Total estimated mass ≤ 30 by sum(length×area factor). Stress estimates suggest max within ±20. Triangulation reduces bending and allows smaller diameter members.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify adherence to constraints: max stress ≤ 20, mass ≤ 30, no duplicate nodes or members, fixed nodes intact.
