Load is a -10N at 45° down-left on node_3. Pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Current design has highly stressed members around nodes 9, 10, 11.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure shows extremely high tensile/compressive stresses on members 5 and 12 (~±240), notably between nodes 11-9 and 10-9, indicating inadequate load path or inefficient force distribution. Mass is close to limit but stresses violate constraints massively. The truss has many intermediate nodes close in x,y positions but does not sufficiently provide direct load transfer to supports or optimal triangulation.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, either reduce member lengths under high stress, add alternative load paths to distribute forces, increase cross-sectional areas on critical members (with caution due to mass), or reposition nodes. We can redesign intermediate nodes to create better triangulation and avoid long slender stressed members. Node 10 and 11 are clustered—perhaps reduce complexity there.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Propose simpler truss with strong triangulation, placing intermediate nodes approximately vertically over load node_3, connecting directly to supports and load node_3. Remove nodes 9, 10, 11 to reduce complex and overloaded areas. Add two nodes at optimal heights near load node_3 for force transfer, ensuring multiple stable triangles. Use members with moderate area to control stress and mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "A typical and efficient 2D truss supporting a load at mid-span uses two supports and an apex node directly above load for load transfer. Here, node_3 under load at (2,0) can be supported by nodes near (1,1.5) and (3.5,1.8). Direct chords from support nodes to apex reduce member length and stress. Areas are selected mainly from \'2\' (0.782) and \'3\' (1.759) to balance strength and mass. Larger areas only for lowest compression/tension members. Load orientation (-45°) means load has both downward and leftward components — so left side node must suitably resist.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Nodes: node_7 at (1.0,1.5), node_8 at (4.0,1.5), new node_10 at (2.8,2.3) to form top triangle.

Areas chosen to maintain stresses ≤20 and mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Estimate member lengths and use areas: For example, member_1 (node_1-node_7): length ~ √(1^2+1.5^2)=1.80, mass=length*area=1.80*0.782=1.41. Similar for others. Total mass sum approximated under 30. Stress assumed reduced by improved triangulation distributing forces evenly.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate members or nodes, load/support nodes unchanged, areas selected from allowed set.
