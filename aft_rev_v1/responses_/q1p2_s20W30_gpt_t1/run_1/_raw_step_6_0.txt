Supports at node_1 (pinned) & node_2 (roller). Current max stress 56.46 > 20. Mass 19.5 < 30. Need to reduce max stress and keep mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has high stress mainly at member_6 (node_8-node_4) and member_1 (node_1-node_7). Members with zero stress indicate possible redundant or suboptimal members. Node_7 and node_8 positions may be adjusted or extra nodes added to better distribute forces. Also, area_id 2 for many members might be increased or decreased to balance stress and mass. Load applied at node_3 pushes joint force diagonally down-left, structure must efficiently channel axial forces to supports without overstressing any member.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Removing or repositioning nodes 7,8,9 to optimize load path. Adding a new node above node_3 to reduce moments. Using smaller areas for less stressed members and larger areas for critical ones. Check if direct members between node_3 and supports with proper triangulation reduce stress.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add an additional node (node_10) above node_3 at (2.0,2.3). Reposition some nodes: node_7 at (1.0,1.2) and node_8 at (4.0,2.0) for better triangulation. Member layout: connect node_1-node_7, node_7-node_10, node_10-node_3, node_10-node_8, node_8-node_9, node_9-node_2, node_4-node_9, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_10-node_4. Assign areas selectively to keep max stress ≤ ±20 and total mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_10 above load node_3 creates a vertical load transfer path, reduces bending moments in members. Moving node_7 closer to ground reduces length of high-stress members. Shifting node_8 towards node_9 improves force flow. Proper triangulation stabilizes forces, lower area members for less stressed, larger areas only where needed. Load path effectively split into multiple smaller members with lower stresses.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member forces assuming axial. Use length to estimate individual member mass = length × area. Area selection from given discrete set. Trial areas: critical members area_id=3 (1.759), less stressed members area_id=1 (0.195) or 2 (0.782). Verify max stress ≤20 by rough proportional scaling from previous results.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Lengths: node_1-node_7 ≈1.562, node_7-node_10=1.2, node_10-node_3=0.7, node_10-node_8=2.236, node_8-node_9=1.0, node_9-node_2=1.971, node_4-node_9=1.118, node_4-node_2=2.5, node_3-node_4=2.5, node_10-node_4=1.118. Choosing areas by stress estimate: heavily loaded members area_id=3 to 4 (1.759-3.128), lightly loaded members area_id=1 or 2. Total mass sum under 30 estimated ~25. Max stress ~20 after area adjustment. Members shorter and more triangulated reduce stress peaks.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "No duplicate nodes or members, all load/support nodes unchanged.
