    "preamble": "Redesign 2D truss to reduce max stress ≤ ±20 and total mass ≤ 30 with given supports and load.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3: 10N at -45°, supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current high compressive stress on member_8 (-291.9) and tensile on member_1 (79.7), total mass 14.34. Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass 30. Areas from provided set. Nodes node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed by supports and load. Can adjust others to optimize.",
    
    "analysis": "Current design has large stress concentrations especially in members connected to node_4 and node_1. The structure lacks triangulation near the loaded node_3 and support node_1 causing high axial force in member_8. Members with area '1' are insufficient causing high stresses. Mass is acceptable so no need to reduce it. Need better load path from node_3 load to supports through stiffer members and triangulation, redistribute forces. Adding a new node upwards near node_3 can help create a truss bay to reduce member lengths and stress. Increase areas on critical members within limits. Remove redundant members with high stress and low benefit.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Plan to add a node (node_9) above node_3 at about (2.0,1.5). Connect node_3, node_9, node_4, node_7. Reduce direct member_8 (node_1 to node_4) or remove it as it sees excessive compressive stress. Use areas from 1 to 4 for main members. Keep members short with proper triangulation. Use member areas of 2 or 3 for load bearing members and 1 for lighter members. Re-assign area codes to critical members. Check member force directions and lengths.",
    
    "proposal": "Add node_9 at precise (2.0,1.5). Remove member_8 (node_1-node_4). Connect node_1 to node_7 and node_9. Connect node_7 to node_3 and node_9. Connect node_9 to node_4 and node_3. Keep node_4 to node_8 and node_8 to node_2. Keep node_7 to node_4 and node_8 to node_4. Member areas: main members 3, secondary 2, minor 1. This increases triangulation near the load and better distributes forces, reducing peak stresses.",
    
    "reasoning": "Adding node above load point creates two triangular bays distributing forces. Removing direct long compression member with high compressive stress reduces overstress. Assigning higher cross-sectional areas to shorter critical members balances stress. The diagonal members carry compressive force efficiently. Areas chosen to keep mass under 30. Node coordinates fixed at load and support nodes to comply with constraints. This layout should reduce max stresses below 20 and keep mass around 20-25.",
