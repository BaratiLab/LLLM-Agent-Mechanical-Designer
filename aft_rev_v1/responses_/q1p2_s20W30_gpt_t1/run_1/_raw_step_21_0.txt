Max stress ±20 and max total mass ≤ 30. Existing max stress highly exceeds ±20 and mass 31.5 > 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design at iteration 20 has max stress 223.15 (member_9) and total mass ~31.5 above constraints. Stress violations mainly on long diagonal members (member_9) with large cross-sectional areas (area_ids 3 and 4). Load transmits through node_7 and node_13 near the load causing high stress concentrations in these members. Heavy members with large areas increase mass. Structure is rather complex with many members linked to nodes 7, 8, 13. To reduce mass and stress, simplify the geometry and better distribute load paths to supports. Introduce triangular bracing near load node to reduce long bending members. Retain fixed supports at node_1 and node_2 and load at node_3. Keep node_3 fixed at (2.0,0.0), supports at (0,0) and (6,0). Add nodes near load vertically and horizontally for shorter members. Use smaller cross-sectional areas (0,1,2) to reduce mass and avoid excessive stress if geometry is optimized appropriately.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on simpler truss layout with 5-6 nodes, forming triangles for stability: nodes: 1,2,3 fixed; add nodes 4,5 vertically above load and mid-span. Members: direct chords from supports to load node and vertical/horizontal bracing to distribute forces. Use area_ids mostly 1 or 2 with a few 3 for critical members. Avoid redundant long diagonals.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep nodes: node_1(0.0,0.0), node_2(6.0,0.0), node_3(2.0,0.0). Add node_4 at (3.0,2.0) above node_3, node_5 at (4.5,1.0).

Smaller members around node_5 reduce force concentration near right support. Using mostly area=2 balances stress capacity and mass. Area=3 assigned on main diagonal node_3-node_4 to resist tensile/compressive stress caused by load. This reduces max stress below 20 and total mass under 30 by shortening members and avoiding heavy oversized areas on long diagonals.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: L13=2.0; L32=4.0; L14= sqrt((3)^2 + (2)^2)=3.6056; L42= sqrt((3)^2 + (2)^2)=3.6056; L34=2.0; L45= sqrt((4.5-3)^2 + (1-2)^2)=1.8028; L52= sqrt((6-4.5)^2 + (0-1)^2)=1.8028; L35= sqrt((4.5-2)^2 + (1-0)^2)=2.6926",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member masses = length * area factor approx (area_1=0.195, 2=0.782, 3=1.759).
