  "preamble": "Optimize a 2D truss for load at node_3, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller), with stress and mass limits.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Need max member stress within ±20, total mass ≤30. Current design exceeds max stress (up to ~58). Areas currently mostly low/moderate (1, 2). Load at node_3 is 10N at -45°. Nodes fixed at node_1 & node_2 (supports) and node_3 (load). Can add/move other nodes. Aim to reduce stress in high load members and improve load path.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design has multiple high stresses on members near node_3, especially member_1 (-58.5) and member_8 (-19). Mass is below max but can be redistributed. Node_5 added in iteration 1 increased mass without sufficient stress relief. Lack of vertical support nodes or triangulation near load causes stress concentrations. Member areas mostly 1 or 2; larger areas increase mass significantly. Optimization requires better load transfer by increasing triangulation and adjusting node positions, possibly adding a new node above node_3 to introduce better load path and reduce stress on members 1 and 8.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_5 to simplify. Add one node (node_6) above node_3 on vertical to form better triangles with node_1 and node_2. Use minimal necessary cross sections, preferably area_id 2 or lower for members directly under tension/compression to control stress. Introduce members node_3 to node_6, node_6 to node_4 (existing at 3.0, 2.5) and node_6 to node_2, so load is better distributed. Check member lengths and assign appropriate areas. Keep node_4 at current position for lateral support.",
  
  "proposal": "Remove node_5 and its members. Add node_6 near (2.0, 3.5). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_3-node_6, node_6-node_4, node_6-node_2. Assign areas to control stress: small areas for short or less loaded members, moderate for main load paths. This gives shorter compression members and better triangulation to reduce max stress below 20 while keeping mass <30.",
  
  "reasoning": "High stress mainly on node_1-node_3 (member_1) and node_3-node_5 (member_8 in previous design). Adding node_6 above node_3 shifts load paths upward and creates more direct load transfer from node_3 to node_2 and node_1 via node_6 and node_4. This reduces stress concentration at fixed supports and on long compression members. Removing node_5 reduces mass and complexity. Using area_id 2 (0.782) or 1 (0.195) selectively avoids heavy mass. Node_4's position at (3.0, 2.5) stays as lateral support. Loads at node_3 are managed by small tension/compression members to node_6. Area choice balances mass and stress",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths for new members using distance formula, check forces approx or based on load and geometry:\n\
- Length node_1-node_3 = sqrt((2-0)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 2.0\n\
- node_3-node_2 = 4.0\n\
- node_1-node_4 = sqrt((3-0)^2 + (2.5-0)^2) ~3.905\n\

- node_6-node_2 = sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-3.5)^2) ~5.3151\n\
Assign areas for lower mass and stress:\n\
- use area 1 or 2 mostly,\n\
- smaller areas on shorter members (node_6-node_4),\n\
- modest areas on long members (node_6-node_2).\n\
Estimate stresses roughly reduced due to triangulation and shorter members. Total mass estimated well below 30.",
