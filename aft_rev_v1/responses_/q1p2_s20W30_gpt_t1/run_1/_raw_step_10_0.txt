Aim: max stress ±20, total mass ≤ 30. Existing design mass 32.54 and max stress 62.28—both violated.",\n  "analysis": "Current design exceeds max stress and mass. High stress in member_11 (62.28) and member_4, member_5 (compressive). Areas for stress reduction are members from node_4 to node_11 and adjacents. Mass too high mainly from large-area members (area 4 and 2). Node_12 helps force distribution but structure is heavy and stressed.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Strategy: reduce high-area members, shorten long members, improve force path via node rearrangement near load (node_3) and supports. Keep defining nodes at load/support fixed. Try adding intermediate nodes to form triangulated stable substructure and redistribute load. Use smaller area sections on less-stressed members, thicker where stressed but keep total mass ≤ 30.",\n  "proposal": "Retain nodes_1, 2, 3 fixed. Move node_4 slightly higher vertically to 3.2 for better leverage. Add node_12 near center (3.0, 1.6) to form triangulated panels. Connect node_7 (1.0,1.2) to node_3, node_4, and node_12. Connect node_8 (4.0, 2.0) to node_4, node_9 (5.0,1.6). Connect node_9 lower to 5.0, 1.6 to reduce lever arm and stress on member to support. Use area selections 2 and 3 mostly; restrict area 4 to only most critical members to save mass. Remove redundant or low-stress members with high area to reduce mass.",\n  "reasoning": "Structural mass reduced by lowering area where stresses are low; stiffer members used selectively. Raising node_4 height increases vertical component to counteract diagonal load component from node_3. Node_12 centralizes force paths forming triangles, reducing bending and shear. Shortening node_9 vertical position reduces moment arm to roller support, decreasing stress in that member.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_1(0,0)-node_7(1,1.2), node_7-node_3(2,0), node_3-node_4(3,3.2), node_4-node_11(3.5,2.7), node_11-node_9(5,1.6), node_9-node_2(6,0), node_4-node_2; assign areas mostly \'2\' or \'3\'.
