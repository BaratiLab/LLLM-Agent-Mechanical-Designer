Current max stress 22.49 exceeds ±20 limit, total mass 27.1771 under 30 max mass. Need to reduce peak stresses, particularly in member_9 (22.49), reconfigure topology and areas to balance load paths, and avoid increasing mass too much.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current design introduces many medium length members around node_7, 8, 9, 11, and 12, with cross bracing but max stresses still slightly too high mainly at member_9 connecting node_7 and node_12. Members 11,12,13 have zero stresses indicating maybe underused paths. Member areas mostly \'2\' or \'3\', moderate size. Some members are loaded near limit, others redundant or unstressed. The load is at node_3 down-left at 45°, support at nodes 1 and 2 on base line. Structural geometry roughly covers span 6 base, height up to 3.2m at node_4, multiple intermediate nodes. Current topology is complex but marginally fails stress constraints. Mass is acceptable but close to limit.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress below 20, strengthen main load paths by larger areas where needed, remove or relocate unnecessary nodes that cause inefficient load transfer, and adjust geometry to distribute forces evenly. Consider reducing number of members with zero or very low stress. Key is stabilizing node_3 load with triangulated members supporting from pinned and roller supports. Possibly move node_12 lower or stronger area members on critical tension/compression paths. Avoid building too heavy members to stay under mass.",\n\n    "proposal": "Retain load/support nodes as is. Remove node_12 and redistribute connections to reduce stress in member_9. Slightly adjust node_9 y-position lower to 1.5 and node_11 y-position to 2.5 for better force flow. Use direct triangulation from node_3 to supports with intermediate nodes at node_7 and node_8. Use area \'3\' and \'4\' for critical tension/compression members like node_4-node_2, node_9-node_2, and node_7-node_4. Use \'2\' for secondary members. This will balance stresses and keep mass below 30.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Removing node_12 simplifies load path; current node_12 and its members induce peak stress at member_9. Slightly lowering node_9 reduces moment arms and reduces compression stress in members connecting node_9 to node_2 and node_4. Strengthening main compression members with area 3 or 4 provides safety factor to reduce peak stress below 20, avoiding excessive mass due to limiting areas above 4. Using triangular layouts with direct load paths is structurally efficient. The load at node_3 is supported by two main legs (via node_7 and node_8) to supports and by stable triangulation in upper truss.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_1(0,0) to node_7(1,1.2), length ~1.56; node_7 to node_3(2,0), length ~1.56 - critical tension area 2; node_3 to node_4(3,3.2), length approx 3.25 area 3; node_4 to node_11(3.5,2.5), length 0.71 area 3; node_11 to node_9(5,1.5), length 1.8 area 3; node_9 to node_2(6, 0), length 1.80 area 4; node_4 to node_2 length ~3.2 area 4. Estimate sum of member lengths * area, approximate total mass below 30 given previous total at 27.1 with more members and area 2 for many members.",\n\n    "calculation": "Sum mass approx: member_1(1.56*2=3.12), member_2(1.56*2=3.12), member_3(3.25*3=9.75), member_4(0.71*3=2.13), member_5(1.80*3=5.4), member_6(1.80*4=7.2), member_7(3.2*4=12.8), total scaled areas less than previous heavy design; members with 2 and 3 areas will keep mass within 30.
