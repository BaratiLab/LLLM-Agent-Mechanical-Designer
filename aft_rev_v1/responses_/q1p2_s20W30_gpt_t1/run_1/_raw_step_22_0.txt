Current max stress 18.08 < 20, mass 17.07 < 30.",\n  "analysis": "Current design shows max stress well within allowable limits and mass comfortably below max. Member stresses are balanced with no extreme localized stresses. Node positions fixed at loaded and support nodes; only possible minor improvements in free node positions explored previously. Area selections are mostly moderate values mostly 1,2,3 for cross sections.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "No members near stress limit; margins exist. Margins on mass too. Structural geometry is compact and closed. No large outliers or redundant members detected.",\n  "reasoning": "Further reduction in stress would require significant geometry or member area changes which given current state have been already iterated upon. Small node displacement within allowed nodes won\'t significantly improve stress distribution. Mass can be further lowered but at risk of increasing stresses beyond limit. Current distributions suggest optimization close to Pareto front. Risk of over-optimizing and breaching constraints outweighs small benefits.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Valid areas: {\'0\':1, \'1\':0.195, \'2\':0.782, \'3\':1.759,...}. Largest area used: 3 for \'member_5\' with stress -4.49 well inside limits. Moving node_4 down from 3.0 to 2.0 lowered stresses markedly. Members with area \'1\' have low stress (4.3), no critical stress points near limits.",\n  "calculation": "Maximum stress is 18.08 < 20 limit; total mass 17.07 < 30 limit; no constraint violation. Members with minimal stress and areas chosen to balance mass and strength. Geometry forms a closed truss with 5 nodes, no duplicate connections, areas selected as per instructions. Load & support nodes unchanged per constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints satisfied. No further beneficial node movements or area adjustments identified in recent iterations.
