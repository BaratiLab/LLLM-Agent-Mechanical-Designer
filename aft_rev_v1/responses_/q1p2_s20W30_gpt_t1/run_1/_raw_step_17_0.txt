Load at node_3 downward left (-10N at -45°). Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Nodes at base 0,0 and 6,0. Key nodes: 3 (load), 4, 7, 8 elevated. Areas used 1 or 4 mostly (area_id \'1\' =0.195, \'3\'=1.759, \'4\'=3.128).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Excessive compressive stress in member_7 (-265.65) connecting node_4-node_3 with small area \'1\'. Mass approaches limit. Structure lacks sufficient load path balance and redundant bracing. Need to redistribute forces with additional nodes and members. Increase areas for high stress members or provide alternate load path.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add mid-top nodes for triangulation. Use diagonal bracing from supports to load node. Use larger cross-section for high-stress compressive members. Reduce length or area of members under low stress. Avoid large areas on all members to keep mass under 30.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Retain supports and load nodes. Add two nodes: node_9 near load area (between node_3 and node_4), node_10 near top right (between node_2 and node_4). Provide triangulated bracing from node_1 to node_9, node_9 to node_4, node_10 to node_4 and node_2. Connect node_3-node_9 with intermediate area. Use area 4 or 5 (3.128 or 4.887) for compressive members with high stress. Use smaller areas (1 or 2) for tension members with moderate stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding nodes redistributes load effectively, reduces member length under tension or compression, and provides alternate load paths reducing peak stress. Triangles provide stability, and diagonal members carry shear forces effectively. Larger areas on compression members prevent buckling and high stress. Mass will stay under 30 with selective larger areas.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths and assign areas: compressive members length approx 2-3m with area ~4 (3.128) resulting member mass ~ length*area.
