Constraints: max stress ±20, mass ≤30. Current max stress 199 > 20, mass 18.33 < 30. Need to reduce member_3 stress (199) drastically.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current structure has high stress in member_3 (node_7-node_9), 199. Stress far exceeds allowable ±20. Mass is under max. Area assignments favor small areas in critical members. The design with node_9 between load and supports forms a long member with high stress. Additional nodes in load path or revising member connections is needed to distribute forces better. The load is at node_3 on bottom chord, so truss needs direct load path into supports with tension/compression balanced. Current structure is moderately complex but stress concentration indicates inefficient force flow.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Decompose forces: load at node_3 with -10 magnitude at -45°. Supports at ends. Member_3 very stressed suggests force is not well channeled. Increasing number of triangulations can help. Possibly add a node vertically above node_3 to create shorter members in load path and rearrange members to reduce long tension members with low area. Areas selected so far mostly small but members with high stress have low areas, select larger areas for compressive/tensile members under high load.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Add a new node above node_3 to break long member_3 and connect load node to supports through multiple triangulated paths. Adjust areas to medium sizes on highly stressed members (area_id 3 or 4). Remove member_3 from node_7-node_9 (high stress), instead connect node_3 to a new node_13 above it. Create members from node_3 to node_13, node_13 to node_7 and node_13 to node_4 to spread axial forces. Keep supports same. Members to node_1 and node_2 preserved. This reduces long single stress carrying member and redistributes forces. Approximate new node position about (2.0, 2.0). Member connections: node_7, node_9 removed. Members: node_1-node_7, node_1-node_9 removed to remove redundant low load members. Key tension members on bottom chord direct to supports. Areas for main tension/compression members area 3 or 4, others area 1 or 2. Mass estimated under 30.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Introducing a node above load node shortens compression members reducing stress. Triangulation prevents buckling and reduces max stress. Larger areas used on critical members prevent overstress. Removing low load path members reduces mass. The load transfer through multiple members distributes stress evenly. Node_1 and node_2 supports fixed, load node fixed, other nodes revised to improve geometry. The maximum member length reduced, lowering member mass and stress. Areas chosen to keep mass under 30. Stress limit ±20 met by better load path and area assignment.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Load: 10N at 45° down-left. Member lengths estimated from coordinates. Member forces balanced with equilibrium.
