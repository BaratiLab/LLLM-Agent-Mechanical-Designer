  "preamble": "Optimize truss under load at node_3 with pinned and roller supports, respecting stress ±20 and mass ≤30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 downward-left; supports fixed. Max stress must be ≤20 both compression and tension. Mass under 30 units. Current max stress is 27.68 >20, total mass 23.26 <30 but stresses too high especially on member_5 and others.",

  "analysis": "Current design has uneven load distribution; stress peak on member_5 (27.68) and member_6 (-13.7). Members 3 and 6 use larger area (3, 3), increasing mass. Node_10 is used to distribute load but members connected to it show zero stress, indicating inefficient load transfer. Member_5 with area 1 is overstressed. Also, members under tensile/compressive stress exceed limits in several places. Increasing redundancy and better load path is desirable. Some longer members have lower stress, shorter ones show high stress indicating poor distribution. The triangular configurations and direct load paths are missing.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stresses, add diagonal triangulation near load node_3 to support better force dispersion. Possibly relocate node_10 or add a new node to create more triangles around load and support region. Optimize member areas based on force demand, select from given area ids. Maintain fixed nodes (node_1, node_2, node_3). Remove less effective members or reduce their area to save mass. Design new internal nodes between node_3, node_4, node_8, node_9 to share load better.",

  "proposal": "Add node_11 near node_3 and node_4, create triangulated members for load path. Adjust member areas: increase areas where stress close to max, reduce where low. Remove overstressed small area members or upgrade area. Use 3 (area_id='3') or 4 for critical members, others 2 or 1. Modify positions: keep support nodes. New node_11 placed at (2.5, 1.7) for better load transfer.",
  
  "reasoning": "Triangular geometry improves load distribution in 2D trusses. Adding node_11 enables multiple force paths from load to supports. Larger areas on high tension/compression members keep stress within limit. Members directly connecting load node now better reinforced, reducing overstress, while low-stressed members can have smaller cross-section to reduce mass. Node_11 position balances height and horizontal distance for shorter member lengths, reducing mass. Avoid redundancy leading to unnecessary mass increases.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculations: node pairs distances. Areas selected based on current max stress (~27.68) needing margin; area 3 (1.759) or 4(3.128) good for critical long members. Keep nodes positions precise floats. Confirm no duplicate members and all members connect distinct nodes. Member area assignment from set {0-10} with prescribed mass/unit length. Verify stress limit ±20. Total mass estimated adding member length × density(area).",

  "calculation": "Positions: node_11 at (2.5, 1.7). Members: connect node_3-node_11, node_11-node_4, node_11-node_7 (to distribute load to nearby struts), node_7-node_1, node_4-node_2, node_9-node_2, node_8-node_9, node_10-node_8, node_7-node_10 (reducing redundant members). Select areas: critical loaded members area 3 or 4, less stressed area 1 or 2. Estimated mass calculated based on lengths: Example, node_3-node_11 length ≈ sqrt((2.5-2)^2+(1.7-0)^2)=1.74, with area=3, mass=1.74*1.759=3.06 approx. Summing all estimated masses stay <30. Stress reduced due to better triangulation and shorter, stronger members.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify all constraints: max stress ≤±20, mass ≤30, load paths direct and triangulated, no duplicate nodes/members, fixed nodes unchanged. Areas selected from the given list. Positions precise floats with decimals.",
