  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to satisfy max stress ±20 and mass ≤30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Loads at node_3 (-10, -45°), supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Existing max stress way above limit (-65 vs ±20), total mass under 30 but large stress suggests redesign.",
  
  "analysis": "Current structure max compressive stress member_1 = -65.27 exceeds ±20. Other members safe but member_5 also high compressive (-39). Mass 12.9 < 30, so mass is not limiting. Structure probably poorly transferring load at node_3 causing high stress in member_1. Need better load path from node_3 to supports. Node_6 at (2,3.5) may be too high or poorly positioned, inducing high compressive stress. Members with large areas (2=0.782) likely cause mass but do not help stress reduction enough. Current topology has no direct element from load node_3 to support node_1 except member_1 causing high stress. Member_8 (node_6 to node_2) area 2 may be large mass contributor, but stress low at 0.64.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding / relocating intermediate node(s) between node_3 and supports to improve force distribution and reduce stress in member_1. Possibly remove node_6 and add two nodes roughly between node_3 and supports for better triangulation. Use smaller area members near highly stressed ones to redistribute forces. Keep load/support nodes fixed as per constraints. Avoid members parallel to ground except base. Use triangles for stiffness.",

  "proposal": "Add two new nodes: node_7 (around (1.0,1.5)) and node_8 (around (4.0,1.5)) to improve triangulation and transfer load from node_3 to supports. Remove node_6. Connect members: node_1-node_7, node_7-node_3, node_3-node_8, node_8-node_2, node_7-node_4, node_8-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_4-node_3. Assign smaller area (1=0.195) to long members to control mass, medium area (2=0.782) to vertical members close to loads/supports. Avoid over large areas on members expected to be highly stressed. This configuration creates two diagonal triangles between supports and node_3, allowing better load path and reducing stress on member_1.",

  "reasoning": "Adding nodes between load and supports improves force transfer via triangulated paths, reduces axial force peak in member_1. Smaller areas reduce mass but must balance stress constraints. Higher vertical location of node_4 allows distribution of upward force. Medium area members near load carry more stress safely. Removing node_6 reduces redundant member causing compressive stress spikes. Final check with approximate member lengths and areas should show mass <30, max stress <±20.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Node tentative positions: node_7=(1.0,1.5), node_8=(4.0,1.5). Member lengths: node_1-node_7=~1.8, node_7-node_3=~1.5, node_3-node_8=~2.2, node_8-node_2=~1.86, node_7-node_4=~1.8, node_8-node_4=~1.4, node_4-node_2=2.5, node_4-node_3=~2.9. Using area ids: 1=0.195 for long diagonals, 2=0.782 for near verticals. Estimating mass sum less than 30 is reasonable. Stress will be tested by FEM but geometric improvement should pass constraints.",

  "calculation": "Sum member mass ~ Σ length*area density: (1.8*0.195)+(1.5*0.195)+(2.2*0.195)+(1.86*0.195)+(1.8*0.782)+(1.4*0.782)+(2.5*0.782)+(2.9*0.782) ≈ 0.35+0.29+0.43+0.36+1.41+1.1+1.96+2.27=~8.17 (well below mass limit). Max stress expected to drop due to better triangulation and load path. Node_3 load resolves into shorter members reducing peak stress.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate members, nodes except load and supports unchanged. All nodes coordinates float with decimals. Area selections from given options. Members connected to create stable, triangulated structure. Mass and stress constraints should hold with this proposal.",
