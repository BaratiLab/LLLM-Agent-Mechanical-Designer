  "preamble": "Optimize truss design under load at node_3 with pinned and roller supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current design exceeds stress and mass limits with redundant member mass.",
  
  "analysis": "Current truss has excessive mass (37.2 > 30) and stress (max 52.7 > 20). Stress concentrates in members 6 and 7, with large area members 3 and 4 also contributing to mass. Load at node_3 (-10kN, -45deg) induces tension/compression that current layout handles poorly. Node_5 addition increased complexity and mass without stress relief. Need simpler, stable geometry with direct load path and optimized area distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce mass by removing node_5 and corresponding members. Use more efficient triangulated geometry between nodes 1,2,3,4. Adjust node_4 vertical position for stiffness. Use lower area members except for highest stressed tension/compression members close to 20 limit. Avoid high eccentricity members with large areas.",
  
  "proposal": "Eliminate node_5. Keep nodes 1,2,3,4 with node_4 raised to 3.0. Members: 1-3, 3-2 (bottom chords), 1-4, 2-4 (top chords), 3-4 (diagonal). Assign areas: reduce member_3 and member_4 areas to 2 to cut mass. Increase member_6 (3-4) area to 3 or 4 if needed for stress. Check lengths and mass to ensure sum < 30. This design provides stable triangulation to distribute load from node_3 under given load and constraints.",
  
  "reasoning": "1. Remove node_5 to reduce complexity and mass. 2. Triangular configuration distributes load effectively. 3. Use small-mid area members (2 or 3) for bottom chords. 4. Use slightly larger members on diagonals for tension/compression control. 5. Node positions fixed for supports and load node 3. 6. Raise node_4 height to increase lever arm and reduce stress. 7. Check member length × area sum for mass. 8. Verify all stresses <= 20 in magnitude by adjusting areas. 9. Avoid large areas on members with low stress demand.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: 1-3 = 2.0m; 3-2 = 4.0m; 1-4 = sqrt(2^2 + 3^2) = 3.606m; 2-4 = sqrt(4^2 + 3^2) = 5.0m; 3-4 = 3.162m.\nMass estimate: sum(length*area) with areas in [2:0.782,3:1.759,4:3.128].\nAssign: M1=2(0.782), M2=2(0.782), M3=2(0.782), M4=2(0.782), M5=3(1.759).\nMass: 2.0*0.782 + 4.0*0.782 + 3.606*0.782 + 5.0*0.782 + 3.162*1.759 ~=1.564+3.128+2.82+3.91+5.56=16.98 <30.\nThis is well within mass. Stress expected reduced due to simplified design. Areas can be slightly adjusted if stress pushes beyond 20 limit.",
  
  "calculation": "Check max stress with load -10kN at node_3, load direction -45deg.\nThe triangular frame effectively converts horizontal and vertical components of load with less member stress.\nAssign minimal areas sufficient for target stresses near 20.\nTotal mass remains ~17 with above assignments, below limit.\nStress distribution expected within constraints based on simpler structure and moderate areas.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "1. Remove node_5 and members related.\n2. Use fixed node coordinates for supports and load nodes.\n3. Use areas chosen from catalog, prefer lower to reduce mass.\n4. Ensure no duplicate members.\n5. Verify mass and stress constraints with estimated lengths and areas.\n6. Propose final node and member dict accordingly.",
