Current design exceeds stress and mass limits with redundant member mass.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current truss has excessive mass (37.2 > 30) and stress (max 52.7 > 20). Stress concentrates in members 6 and 7, with large area members 3 and 4 also contributing to mass. Load at node_3 (-10kN, -45deg) induces tension/compression that current layout handles poorly. Node_5 addition increased complexity and mass without stress relief. Need simpler, stable geometry with direct load path and optimized area distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce mass by removing node_5 and corresponding members. Use more efficient triangulated geometry between nodes 1,2,3,4. Adjust node_4 vertical position for stiffness. Use lower area members except for highest stressed tension/compression members close to 20 limit. Avoid high eccentricity members with large areas.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Eliminate node_5. Keep nodes 1,2,3,4 with node_4 raised to 3.0. Members: 1-3, 3-2 (bottom chords), 1-4, 2-4 (top chords), 3-4 (diagonal). Assign areas: reduce member_3 and member_4 areas to 2 to cut mass. Increase member_6 (3-4) area to 3 or 4 if needed for stress. Check lengths and mass to ensure sum < 30. This design provides stable triangulation to distribute load from node_3 under given load and constraints.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "1. Remove node_5 to reduce complexity and mass. 2. Triangular configuration distributes load effectively. 3. Use small-mid area members (2 or 3) for bottom chords. 4. Use slightly larger members on diagonals for tension/compression control. 5. Node positions fixed for supports and load node 3. 6. Raise node_4 height to increase lever arm and reduce stress. 7. Check member length × area sum for mass. 8. Verify all stresses <= 20 in magnitude by adjusting areas. 9. Avoid large areas on members with low stress demand.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: 1-3 = 2.0m; 3-2 = 4.0m; 1-4 = sqrt(2^2 + 3^2) = 3.606m; 2-4 = sqrt(4^2 + 3^2) = 5.0m; 3-4 = 3.162m.\\nMass estimate: sum(length*area) with areas in [2:0.782,3:1.759,4:3.128].\\nAssign: M1=2(0.782), M2=2(0.782), M3=2(0.782), M4=2(0.782), M5=3(1.759).\\nMass: 2.0*0.782 + 4.0*0.782 + 3.606*0.782 + 5.0*0.782 + 3.162*1.759 ~=1.564+3.128+2.82+3.91+5.56=16.98 <30.\\nThis is well within mass.
