Supports pinned node_1, roller node_2. Existing max stress 29.05 > 20, mass 8.7 < 30. Need to reduce peak stress, especially member_3 and member_4.",\n\n    "analysis": "High tensile stress (29.05) on member_3 (node_1-node_4) and 20.15 on member_4 (node_2-node_4) indicate overload on vertical members. Area sizes currently small (1 and 2). Node_4 above is fixed, and node_3 on bottom chord. Structure is basic triangle with a chord. Adding node to redistribute load and adding diagonal members for better force path can lower stresses. Increase some member cross-sections strategically.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding node_5 between node_3 and node_4 horizontally to reduce length and stress on members connected to node_4, add member_6 diagonal (node_5-node_2), and strengthen critical members with slightly larger area. Keep node_1 and node_2 fixed.",\n\n    "proposal": "Add node_5 at (3.5, 1.5), add members: node_3-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_5-node_2. Increase areas of members node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4 to area 3 (1.759) or 4 (3.128) to reduce stress. Use smaller areas for bottom chord members and new diagonal members to keep mass in check. Remove or avoid redundant members to keep member count efficient.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Adding intermediate node reduces long member spans and distributes forces better. Increasing cross-sectional area on heavily stressed members reduces stress. Introducing diagonals improves stability and force transfer, reducing peak stresses. Areas selected from allowed set balancing mass and strength. Mass should remain well below 30, stress within ±20.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and forces estimated from planar geometry. Node positions chosen for good triangulation. Areas assigned based on required strength: heavily stressed tension/compression get larger area. New members keep structure statically determinate and improve load path.",\n\n    "calculation": "Lengths: node_1-node_4 ~3.0, node_2-node_4 ~3.0, node_3-node_5 ~1.8, node_5-node_4 ~1.5, node_5-node_2 ~1.8. Using area 3 (1.759) for verticals, and area 2 (0.782) or 1 (0.195) for smaller members. Total mass approx sum(length * area). Rough check: (3.0*1.759)*2 + (1.8*0.782)*2 + (1.5*0.782) + bottom chord (node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2): (2.0*0.782)*2 = approx 10 mass max, under 30.
