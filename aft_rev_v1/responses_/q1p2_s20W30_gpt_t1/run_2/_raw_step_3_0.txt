Current design at iter 2 has max stress 13.06 and mass 16.7, well under limits.",\n  "analysis": "Current nodes at fixed boundary (node_1 and node_2) and load (node_3) with a single internal node (node_4). Members use areas optimized to balance mass and stress. Max stress is 13.06, safely below 20, and total mass 16.7 < 30. Further reductions in stress unlikely by moving node_4 within constraint as load/support nodes fixed and members are minimal.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_4 could be adjusted slightly to potentially reduce stress, but given margins and prior history showing increased mass and stresses with added nodes, current simple 4-node truss is efficient.",\n  "reasoning": "Prior attempts to add nodes increased mass and stress. Current topology is minimal closed truss with triangle + diagonal. Member areas selected to ensure stress <20. Moving node_4 could trade stress but gains minimal under fixed load/support. Current max stress 13 is low enough, close to structural efficiency.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress mostly on member_1 (-13.06) under compression. Members connecting node_4 have low stress. Mass ratio is comfortable. Suggest no changes to nodes or members. Members maintain area ids: member_1 to member_4 with area \'2\' (0.782), member_5 at \'3\' (1.759) for diagonal stiffness.",\n  "calculation": "No violation in constraints. Member lengths standard. Node positions as per current iter 2: node_1 (0.0,0.0), node_2 (6.0,0.0), node_3 (2.0,0.0), node_4 (2.0,3.0). Member areas: member_1 to 4 area id \'2\', member_5 \'3\'. Mass sum 16.7 < 30. Max stress 13.06 < 20. No further improvement justifies added complexity or node shifts.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met with good margin. No duplicated nodes or members.
