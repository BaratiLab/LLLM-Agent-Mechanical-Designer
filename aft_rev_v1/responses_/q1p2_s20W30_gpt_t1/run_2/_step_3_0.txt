  "preamble": "Optimized 2D truss with reduced max stress and within mass constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Goal is to minimize max stress ≤ 20 and mass ≤ 30. Current design at iter 2 has max stress 13.06 and mass 16.7, well under limits.",
  "analysis": "Current nodes at fixed boundary (node_1 and node_2) and load (node_3) with a single internal node (node_4). Members use areas optimized to balance mass and stress. Max stress is 13.06, safely below 20, and total mass 16.7 < 30. Further reductions in stress unlikely by moving node_4 within constraint as load/support nodes fixed and members are minimal.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_4 could be adjusted slightly to potentially reduce stress, but given margins and prior history showing increased mass and stresses with added nodes, current simple 4-node truss is efficient.",
  "reasoning": "Prior attempts to add nodes increased mass and stress. Current topology is minimal closed truss with triangle + diagonal. Member areas selected to ensure stress <20. Moving node_4 could trade stress but gains minimal under fixed load/support. Current max stress 13 is low enough, close to structural efficiency.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress mostly on member_1 (-13.06) under compression. Members connecting node_4 have low stress. Mass ratio is comfortable. Suggest no changes to nodes or members. Members maintain area ids: member_1 to member_4 with area '2' (0.782), member_5 at '3' (1.759) for diagonal stiffness.",
  "calculation": "No violation in constraints. Member lengths standard. Node positions as per current iter 2: node_1 (0.0,0.0), node_2 (6.0,0.0), node_3 (2.0,0.0), node_4 (2.0,3.0). Member areas: member_1 to 4 area id '2', member_5 '3'. Mass sum 16.7 < 30. Max stress 13.06 < 20. No further improvement justifies added complexity or node shifts.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met with good margin. No duplicated nodes or members. Nodes fixed for supports and loads. Structure is closed and minimal. Recommend stopping optimization here for best balance of stress and mass.",
