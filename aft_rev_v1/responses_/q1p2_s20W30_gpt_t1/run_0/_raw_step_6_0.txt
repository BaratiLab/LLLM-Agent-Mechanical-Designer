Loads fixed at node_3, supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Areas are area_id \'2\' = 0.782 for all members. Node_4 position influences stress distribution most. Members connected to node_4 have tensile stress ~8 or less and compressive ~9 max.",\n  "analysis": "Node_4 moved down and left from previous iterations to reduce mass and stress. Max compressive stress in member_1 (-14.3) near allowed limit but not exceeding. Mass reduced to 12.8 from ~14 previously. Members with high compressive stress are member_1 and member_5. Member_4 has moderate tensile stress increase. All within constraints. Load fixed at node_3 downward-left.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further reducing node_4 height reduces mass and stress on members 3-4 and 5, but member_1 compressive stress remains very close to max compressive allowable (-20). Slight horizontal shift of node_4 toward center might reduce max stress in member_1 and balance stresses better.",\n  "reasoning": "To minimize max stress, improve force distribution by adjusting node_4 toward node_3 horizontally (slightly increase x) and maintaining modest y ~2.5 or less to keep member lengths short. This should reduce member_1 compressive stress and member_5 compressive stress simultaneously. Areas remain \'2\' as this balances mass and stiffness. Constraints on not moving load/support nodes restrict optimization to node_4 position only. Members and connectivity optimal and forming closed truss.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check if moving node_4 from (2.18, 2.5) to approx (2.3 - 2.4, 2.4) reduces max compressive stress in member_1 and member_5. Member lengths calculated for verification: member_1 (node_1 to node_3) fixed, member_3 (node_1 to node_4), member_5 (node_3 to node_4), member_4 (node_4 to node_2). Shorter vertical members reduce bending. Areas at \'2\' = 0.782 consistent for mass balance, keeping total mass ~13 or less. Stress proportional to force/area, so distribution helps minimize max stress.",\n  "calculation": "Updated position of node_4 to (2.38, 2.43) balancing between previous down-left and closer to node_3. Estimated member lengths roughly: member_3 ≈ sqrt(2.38² + 2.43²)=~3.4, member_4 ≈ sqrt((6-2.38)² + 2.43²)=~4.3, member_5 ≈ sqrt((2-2.38)² + (0-2.43)²)=~2.46. Expected slight stress drop in member_1 and member_5 due to better force path. Mass unchanged approx 13 or less. Stress estimated to stay under ±14.3 with better balance.
