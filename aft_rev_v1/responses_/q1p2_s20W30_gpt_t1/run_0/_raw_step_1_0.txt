Mass 14.69 well below max 30. Nodes fixed at supports and loads: node_1, node_2, node_3. Only node_4 movable. Current member cross-section \'2\' area=0.782. Focus on reducing stress in member_1 and member_5 with highest absolute stresses.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Node_3 position fixed (load applied); node_4 at (2.5, 3.5). High compressive stress on member_1 (-13.35) and member_5 (-9.13). Member_1 length ~2m; member_5 length ~3.04m. Members 3 and 4 show moderate tensile stress. Load direction (-10, -45 deg) induces these stress distributions. By adjusting node_4 vertically and horizontally, can redistribute forces and reduce peak stresses.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Trade-off: lowering node_4 y-coordinate may reduce member_1 compression but increase others. Shifting node_4 slightly right or left can adjust member_3 and member_4 stresses. Also consider area changes if needed, but current areas are moderate.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Move node_4 slightly right to reduce bending and compressive loads on member_1 and member_5, and slightly down to reduce overall stress. Keep node_3 fixed because load is applied there and fixed support at node_1 and node_2. Area of members remain at \'2\' to keep mass low. Minor node moves could optimize force flow, reducing max stress and total mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4 original (2.5,3.5). Try (2.8,3.0). This shortens member_3 and member_5 lengths slightly, redistributes load paths. Length calculations for members after move: member_3 (node_1 - node_4) length increases from 3.5355 to approx 3.82 but may lower stress. Member_5 shorter. Check combined effect.",\n  \n  "calculation": "New node_4 at (2.8, 3.0). Member lengths and stresses expected to reduce max stresses below current 13.35. Mass estimated similar, possibly slightly reduced if stresses lowered due to better force distribution. All cross-sectional areas kept at \'2\' (0.782) to avoid mass increase and maintain structural capacity.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_3 fixed (load). Node_1, node_2 fixed (supports).
