The load on node_3 causes this. Member_3 and member_5 have moderate tension/compression. Mass is well below max. Node_4 controls geometry affecting force distribution. Position adjustment of node_4 can improve stress distribution. Member areas fixed at \'2\' (area=0.782) are moderate. To reduce max stress, try raising node_4 slightly and shifting horizontally for better triangulation and stiffness.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing node_4 y increases stiffness, reducing member_1 compression.

Too high y may increase member_3 and member_4 stresses.",\n  "reasoning": "Member_1 is under highest compression due to load orientation. Elevating node_4 by ~0.15 to 0.2 units and shifting right by ~0.15 units increases load path stiffness and load distribution among members 3,4,5, reducing member_1 stress.
