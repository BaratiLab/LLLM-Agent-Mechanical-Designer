Load at node_3; supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. Node_4 repositioned from (2.5,3.5) to (2.8,3.0) decreased total mass and altered stresses but max stress increased.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress increased slightly from 13.35 to 14.67 after moving node_4 lower and more right. Mass decreased. Members 1 and 5 have highest compressive stresses; member 3 tensile stress moderate. Since nodes 1,2,3 fixed, only node_4 can be moved. Adjusting node_4 closer to vertical midline between node_1 and node_2 at a moderate height might balance stress distribution and reduce max stress. Existing member connections form a good closed shape (triangular with diagonals). Areas kept \'2\' so moderate cross section; slight area adjustment might be tested but focus now on geometry optimization to minimize stress.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Key goal: reduce high compressive stress on member_1 and 5 and tensile on member_3 by adjusting node_4 position in xy-plane. Max member length is about 3-4 units; area 0.782. Consider moving node_4 slightly left and upward from current (2.8, 3.0) toward (2.6,3.2) or (2.5,3.3). Load direction is -45 deg on node_3, so adjusting node_4 might shift force path for better stress distribution.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "By moving node_4 towards left and slightly upward, length of members connected to node_4 changes, potentially lowering compressive force magnitudes in member_1 and member_5 and tensile stress in member_3. Maintaining closed truss shape ensures geometric stability. Keep area \'2\' to ensure member capacities intact. Slight increase in height can increase vertical stiffness reducing bending effects from load at node_3. Lowering node_4 moved closer but stress rose possibly due to higher compressive force in member_1. A moderate reposition towards centerline between node_1 and node_2 vertically upwards is preferred for stress reduction.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Using node_4 position (x=2.6, y=3.2), lengths recalculated: member_3 and 4 lengths increase slightly; member_5 length increases moderately; member_1 length slightly increases.
