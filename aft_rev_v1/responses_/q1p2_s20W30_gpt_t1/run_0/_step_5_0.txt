  "preamble": "Optimize nodal position of node_4 to reduce member_1 and member_5 stress while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress ±14.74 <20 constraint met; total mass 13.18 <30; node_1 and node_2 fixed; only node_4 movable; all members area_id=2 (0.782); max tensile member_3 stress ~8.3; max compressive member_1 ~-14.7.",
  
  "analysis": "Current stress concentrates highest in member_1 (compressed) and member_3 (tension) and member_5 (compression). By adjusting node_4 closer to node_3 and slightly up, we can reduce force demand in member_1 and member_5 while keeping a stable geometry. Past trend: lowering node_4 y from 3.0 to 2.7 reduced total mass and modulated stresses, but max stress rose slightly. Need fine-tune node_4 position to reduce stress under max 20 and potentially reduce mass. Areas remain at 2 (0.782) which seems balanced. Avoid increasing area as mass is budgeted comfortably.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Shifting node_4 horizontally impacts member_3 and member_4 lengths and force flow. Enlarging triangle height increases member_3 tension but reduces compression in members linked to node_1. Lowering node_4 vertically decreases lever arm reducing member_3 stress but may cause lateral instability.",
  
  "reasoning": "Keeping existing members and area assignment, optimize node_4 position to minimize max stress by balancing forces. Moving node_4 closer to node_3 horizontally (toward 2.2) and lowering vertically to about 2.5 might reduce stress while preserving truss closure and stability (4 members connected at node_4). This will shorten member_3 and member_5, potentially reducing stresses there. Member_1 length also reduces. Check mass, likely decreased or nearly constant. Areas remain same, no capacity added to keep mass low.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Try node_4 coordinates near (2.2, 2.5):\n- member_1 length ≈ sqrt((2.2)^2 + (2.5)^2) ~3.33\n- member_5 length ≈ sqrt((2.0 - 2.2)^2 + (0.0 - 2.5)^2) ~2.5;\nArea 0.782, mass proportional to member lengths.\nEstimate stress decrease due to shorter lengths and reduced moment arms from loads.",
  
  "calculation": "Move node_4 to (2.18, 2.5) to balance shorter member_1 and member_5, reduce max compressive stress ~14.7 to hopefully below 13.5. Estimated mass sum roughly below previous 13.18 because member lengths reduced. Member areas fixed at '2' (0.782). Ensure no overlap or duplicate nodes. Members unchanged. Keep load at node_3 and supports fixed.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New node_4 placement: (2.18, 2.5). Members unchanged, areas all '2'. Reduced max stress expected safely under constraints, mass lower or similar. No design violations detected.",
