  "preamble": "Optimize the 2D truss by refining node_4 position to reduce max stress further within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress is 13.97 < 20, mass 13.73 < 30, areas fixed at '2'. Load at node_3, supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Adjust node_4 only.",
  
  "analysis": "Max compressive stress on member_1 (-13.97) close to limit. Area '2' (0.782) used throughout. Member stresses unevenly distributed. Node_4 position has been adjusted in past iterations showing max stress trends with its vertical and horizontal movement. Current node_4 at (2.45, 3.0) mass below 14 and max stress ~14. Need to lower max stress focus on member_1 and possibly member_5.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Decreasing y of node_4 reduces compressive stress on member_1, but past iterations show no large improvement below y=3.0. Slight horizontal shifts near current x=2.45 may balance axial forces better. Areas could be optimized, but constraint limits to area '2' used now, so node repositioning is primary tool.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_1 large compressive stress likely due to near-vertical load transfer. Slight shift of node_4 right toward node_3 might reduce stress in member_1 and redistribute forces to members 3 and 5. Minor vertical tweak may help maintain closure and force equilibrium. The members form a stable triangle with node_4; maintaining a near optimal shape close to equilateral/trapezoidal can decrease stress peaks. Mass is under limit allowing slight length changes.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Keep x3=2.0 fixed (load node), x1=0, x2=6 fixed (supports). Move node_4 from (2.45,3.0) to approx (2.55, 2.7). Check approximate member lengths and estimate stresses trend. Members: 1: node1-node3, 2: node3-node2, 3: node1-node4, 4: node4-node2, 5: node3-node4.",
  
  "calculation": "New node_4 at (2.55, 2.7) decreases member_1 length slightly but improves angle to node_3, sharing load with members 3 and 5. Estimates: member_1 length ~2.0, member_3 length ~3.0, member_5 length ~2.9, mass approx proportional to previous iteration ~13.8-14.0 (within limits). Expected stress redistribution lowers max compressive stress from 13.97 to ~13.0. Mass remains <30 due to unchanged areas.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "No duplicate nodes or members. Supports and loads unaltered. Areas remain on '2'. New node positions precise floats. Closed truss maintained with 5 members. Constraints satisfed: max stress <20, mass <30.",
