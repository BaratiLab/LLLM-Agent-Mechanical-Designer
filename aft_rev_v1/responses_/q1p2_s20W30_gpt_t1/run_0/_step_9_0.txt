    "preamble": "Optimizing truss node placement to reduce max stress within constraints.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress ~14.83 is below Â±20; mass ~12.9 well below 30 limit. Load on node_3, supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 fixed. Node_4 moved iteratively to adjust stress distribution.",
    
    "analysis": "Max compressive stress concentrated on member_1 (-14.83), tensile highest on member_3 (+8.36). Member 1 is critical in compression; member 3 in tension. Member areas fixed at '2' (0.782), per current design. Node_4 height and horizontal position adjustments influence stress distribution. Current mass is relatively low, so increasing area on highly stressed members may reduce stress, but we were instructed not to change member areas from current. Must optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress by better geometry.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "Stress in member_1 close to limit; shifting node_4 upwards and slightly right may reduce compression in member_1 by changing angle and load path; also balancing stresses in diagonal members.",
    
    "reasoning": "Increasing height of node_4 (present y=2.55) likely reduces compression in bottom chord member_1 by creating better triangle shape; slight horizontal shift to the right also improves load spread. Avoid excessive height to keep member lengths and hence mass controlled. Maintain existing members and areas. Node_3 and end supports fixed, so only node_4 movable. Minor nodal position changes in node_4 coordinates to reduce max stress. Aim to balance and reduce compressive stress in member_1 and tensile in member_3 closer together to reduce overall max stress.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "By shifting node_4 to (~2.55 to 2.65 height, slight x to 2.50-2.55), we expect member_1 compression to reduce from -14.83 closer to -13 to -14 range; tensile in member_3 also reduced due to altered angle. Mass remains within bounds since member lengths change little. Should avoid increasing length of member_4 too much to not increase mass.",
    
    "calculation": "Adjust node_4 from (2.45, 2.55) to (2.53, 2.63). This small upward and right shift is calculated considering previous iterations where node_4 moved around that range and improved stress slightly. Keep member areas at '2' (0.782) as before. Members: same connections. Estimated stress reduction a bit below current 14.83 max, targeting ~14.0 max stress based on past trends. Total mass near current 12.9.",
    "scratch_pad_final": "New node_4 position (2.53, 2.63) expected to reduce max stress slightly while keeping mass low and constraints satisfied. Stop=False to allow further refinement if possible next iterations.",
