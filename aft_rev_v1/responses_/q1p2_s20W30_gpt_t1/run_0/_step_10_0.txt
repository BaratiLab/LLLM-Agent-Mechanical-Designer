  "preamble": "Optimize stress by adjusting node_4's position within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints allow max stress Â±20, current max stress ~14.84, mass 13.05 < 30. Loaded at node_3 fixed, supports fixed, can only move node_4.",

  "analysis": "Max compressive stress at member_1 and tensile at member_3. Member_1 stress is close to max limit (-14.84 vs -20). Mass is well below max 30, so some member area increase possible for stress reduction if needed. Node_4 at (2.53, 2.63), previous iterations show varying node_4 y around 2.4-3.2. Higher node_4 tends to increase stress, lower reduces. Horizontal position affects force distribution in diagonals.", 
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider slightly lowering node_4 y or shifting right to reduce axial forces in member_1. This should reduce its compressive stress closest to limit. Member areas are fixed at '2'.",

  "reasoning": "Member_1 has highest compressive stress, could reduce by decreasing its length or load effect. Node_4 connects node_1 and node_2 diagonally. If node_4 lowers vertically, compression in member_1 reduces but might increase in others. Shifting node_4 slightly right spreads forces. Aim to reduce max stresses from ~14.8 to below 14.5 while keeping mass ~13.", 
  "scratch_pad_3": "Try lowering node_4 y from 2.63 to ~2.45-2.5, shift x slightly right from 2.53 to 2.6. Keep all members same area '2'. Check member lengths: member_1 length reduces, member_3 length may increase slightly.",

  "calculation": "New node_4 at (2.60, 2.48). Length member_1: sqrt((2.6-0)^2 + (2.48-0)^2) = sqrt(6.76+6.15)= sqrt(12.91)=3.593, shorter than previous ~ ? Shorter length => less axial load. Mass approx proportional to length*area, so similar mass ~13. New geometry expected to reduce member_1 stress under compression from -14.84 to around -14.5. Other members remain close in stress but within limits.", 
  "scratch_pad_final": "This node move respects load/support fixed points, keeps closed truss and constraints. Mass under 30, max stress under 20. Further major improvements unlikely given current topology and loading.",
