  "preamble": "Optimize nodal position of free node to reduce stress while keeping constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 13.94 < 20, total mass 14.11 < 30. Load at node_3, support fixed at node_1 and node_2. Only node_4 movable. Areas fixed at id '2' = 0.782. Members form a quadrilateral with diagonal.",
  
  "analysis": "Stress on member_1 highest in compression (-13.94). Member_3 tension 7.77. Moving node_4 affects internal force distribution. Previous iterations showed stress changes, but similar level. Current node_4 at (2.6, 3.2).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce member_1 compression: possibly move node_4 closer horizontally toward node_3 or reduce height to balance forces. Must maintain closed truss. Moving node_4 closer to node_3 horizontally, slightly reduced height could reduce bending, lower max compression. Keep areas constant at '2'.",
  
  "reasoning": "Since load is applied at node_3 downward-left direction, node_4 placement affects force paths to supports. Moving node_4 too far right or too high increases stress in members 3 and 1. Moving node_4 slightly left and lower will reduce member_1 compression while balancing member_3 tension. The mass is acceptable, so do not increase lengths significantly.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Try node_4 coordinates near (2.4, 3.0). Check if length changes maintain mass under 30. Members lengths approximately: 1-3=2, 3-2=4, 1-4=about 3, 4-2=around 3.3, 3-4 ~ 3.3. Confirm mass ~14 acceptable. Stress expected to drop below 13.9 by better geometry.",
  
  "calculation": "Set node_4 = (2.45, 3.0). Calculate member lengths and expected force redistribution. Small horizontal shift of node_4 towards node_3 reduces lever arm of stress in member_1, and slightly reducing height reduces bending moment. Keep all areas = '2' = 0.782 to keep mass low and shape stable.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New design with node_4 at (2.45, 3.0) will maintain closed truss, avoid duplications, preserve supports and loads, keep mass below 30, reduce max stress from 13.94 to around 13.2 estimated. Recommend continuing optimization next iteration.",
