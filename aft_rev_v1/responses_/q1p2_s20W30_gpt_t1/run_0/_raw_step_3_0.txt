Moving node_4 too far right or too high increases stress in members 3 and 1. Moving node_4 slightly left and lower will reduce member_1 compression while balancing member_3 tension. The mass is acceptable, so do not increase lengths significantly.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Try node_4 coordinates near (2.4, 3.0). Check if length changes maintain mass under 30.
