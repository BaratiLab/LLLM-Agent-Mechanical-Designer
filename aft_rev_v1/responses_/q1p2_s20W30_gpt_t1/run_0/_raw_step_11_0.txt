Loaded at node_3, supports fixed. We can only move node_4 to optimize.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress occurs mainly in member_1 (-15.36), which is compressed. Members around node_4 have moderate tensile/compressive stresses. Node_4 moved downward from earlier iterations to near current 2.6,2.48. The slight increase in stress from prior iterations suggests node_4 elevation and horizontal position affect member_1 and member_5 stress. We want to reduce compressive stress in member_1 and tensile in member_3 while keeping mass and constraints satisfied.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Trade-off between vertical position and horizontal position of node_4: too high increases tensile stress in member_3, too low causes instability and higher stress in member_1 compressive.
