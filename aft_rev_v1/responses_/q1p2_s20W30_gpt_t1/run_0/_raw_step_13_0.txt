Mass still well below limit (15.15 < 30). Load/support nodes fixed. Area for highest stressed member_1 increased from 2 to 3 to reduce stress.",\n  "analysis": "Stress is significantly reduced compared to prior iterations, now under 10. Max compressive and tensile stresses under allowable Â±20. Total mass also well below 30. Node_4 repositioned at (2.7, 2.7) yields better stress balance. Member areas chosen mostly at \'2\' except member_1 at \'3\'. Given constraints, no further large improvements expected without adding members or changing load/support nodes, which is disallowed.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 area increased effectively lowered stresses. Further repositioning node_4 risks increasing stress in other members. Stress distribution is balanced. Mass increased moderately but within limit.",\n  "reasoning": "Stress minimization achieved by increasing area of critical member (member_1) and optimizing position of free node_4. Maintaining closed truss with 5 members ensures structural integrity. Load positioned at node_3 requires it to remain fixed; supports pinned and roller fixed so only node_4 free to move. Current design is near optimal given these conditions.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member_1 length approx sqrt((2-0)^2+(2.7-0)^2)=sqrt(4+7.29)=3.35. With area corresponding to \'3\' (1.759), member mass ~3.518 consistent. Max stress in member_1 reduced from ~-15 to -6.7. Other members have reasonable stresses. Mass well below limit so area could be slightly reduced but stress margin is comfortable.",\n  "calculation": "Verified current max stress at 9.34 < 20 limit and mass 15.15 < 30. No violations. Further reduction in stress likely requires redesign outside allowable moves or member additions, so current design is acceptably optimal.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met; max stress and mass within limits.
