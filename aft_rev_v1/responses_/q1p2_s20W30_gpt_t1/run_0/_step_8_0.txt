  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: minimize stress (currently 14.8 < 20) and keep mass â‰¤ 30 (currently 13.08). Constraints met. Node_1 and node_2 fixed due to supports; node_3 fixed due to load. Only movable: node_4.",
  
  "analysis": "Current max stress is member_1 (-14.8), compressive, close but under limit. Members around node_4 show tensile stress ~8.3 to 4.9, compressive ~-9.2. Lowering or slightly shifting node_4 horizontally could redistribute forces, reduce peak compressive stress.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_4 at (2.53,2.65). Previous steps suggested lower and slightly horizontal moves reduced mass and stress. Increasing height often increased mass/stress. Horizontal shift towards node_3 could reduce member_1 compressive stress.",
  
  "reasoning": "Decrease height y of node_4 slightly (~2.5 - 2.55) and shift x slightly closer to node_3 (2.0 < x < 2.53) to reduce member_1 length and its compressive stress. Maintain closed truss with same member connections and areas. Keep area '2' for uniformity and moderate mass.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate new node_4 around (2.45, 2.55). This shortens member_1 and member_3, potentially reducing compression on member_1 and tension on member_3. Other members likely less affected. Mass under 30, area remains '2'.",
  
  "calculation": "Proposed node_4: (2.45, 2.55). Member_1 length sqrt((2.45)^2 + 2.55^2) ~3.53 shorter than current 3.73, reduces mass and compression. Member_3 length shorter also. Estimated slight reduction of compressive stress on member_1, tensile on member_3. Mass reduction ~0.2 units expected. Constraints likely met. Members unchanged.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Final nodes: node_1 (0.0, 0.0), node_2 (6.0, 0.0), node_3 (2.0, 0.0), node_4 (2.45, 2.55). Members same connections, same areas '2'. Expect stress < 14.8, mass < 13.1, constraints satisfied. Continue optimization if stress reduction small; else stop.",
