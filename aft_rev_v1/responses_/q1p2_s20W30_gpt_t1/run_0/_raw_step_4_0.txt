Member stresses unevenly distributed. Node_4 position has been adjusted in past iterations showing max stress trends with its vertical and horizontal movement. Current node_4 at (2.45, 3.0) mass below 14 and max stress ~14. Need to lower max stress focus on member_1 and possibly member_5.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Decreasing y of node_4 reduces compressive stress on member_1, but past iterations show no large improvement below y=3.0. Slight horizontal shifts near current x=2.45 may balance axial forces better. Areas could be optimized, but constraint limits to area \'2\' used now, so node repositioning is primary tool.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_1 large compressive stress likely due to near-vertical load transfer. Slight shift of node_4 right toward node_3 might reduce stress in member_1 and redistribute forces to members 3 and 5. Minor vertical tweak may help maintain closure and force equilibrium. The members form a stable triangle with node_4; maintaining a near optimal shape close to equilateral/trapezoidal can decrease stress peaks. Mass is under limit allowing slight length changes.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Keep x3=2.0 fixed (load node), x1=0, x2=6 fixed (supports). Move node_4 from (2.45,3.0) to approx (2.55, 2.7).
