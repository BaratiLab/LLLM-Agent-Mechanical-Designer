  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss with given nodes and loads, minimize stress ≤ ±20 and mass ≤ 30.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given three nodes on x-axis (0,0), (6,0), (2,0). Load -10N at 45° downward (assumed vector at node_3). Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Need closed truss with all nodes connected, mass ≤ 30, stress ≤ ±20.",
  
  "analysis": "With three colinear nodes, to have a closed truss, we must add at least one more node off-axis to form triangles. Node_3 loaded diagonally, nodes 1 and 2 supported. To minimize stress, arrange triangle connecting nodes_1, _3, _2 and add a new node_4 above on y-axis forming a triangular polygon. Members will primarily be in tension or compression. Use simple static equilibrium and approximate axial forces assuming pin-jointed truss. Choose smallest areas that keep stress within ±20 and mass ≤ 30.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at x=2.5, y=3.5 roughly above node_3 to form closed shape. Connect members: 1-3, 3-2, 1-4, 4-2, 3-4 for stability. Calculate lengths, assign areas from available set. Assumptions: linear elasticity, uniform axial load distribution, neglecting self-weight except given.",
  
  "reasoning": "Introduce node_4 at (2.5, 3.5) to form closed quadrilateral 1-3-2-4-1 with diagonals to distribute load. Total structure enclosed, all members connected. Calculate member lengths and resultant axial forces from load vector. Use F/A = stress ≤ 20 to select area. Mass computed by sum(length×area). Check mass ≤ 30. Prioritize smaller areas where stress is low. Use geometry to calculate member length and direction for force balance.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: 1-3=2.0, 3-2=4.0, 1-4 ≈ sqrt((2.5)^2 + (3.5)^2)=4.3, 4-2 ≈ sqrt((3.5)^2 + (3.5)^2)=4.95, 3-4 ≈ sqrt((0.5)^2 + (3.5)^2)=3.54\nLoad at node_3: -10N at -45° → Fx= -7.07 N, Fy= -7.07 N\nForce equilibrium at node_3 distributed in members 1-3, 3-2, 3-4.\nEstimate forces and select areas to keep stress within ±20.\nMass approx sum(length*area_id), choose minimal areas satisfying constraints.",
