  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 location to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress ~15 < 20, mass ~12.68 < 30; target stress reduction, keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed.",
  "analysis": "Current max stress is on member_1 (-14.95), a compression member from node_1 to node_3. The load on node_3 causes this. Member_3 and member_5 have moderate tension/compression. Mass is well below max. Node_4 controls geometry affecting force distribution. Position adjustment of node_4 can improve stress distribution. Member areas fixed at '2' (area=0.782) are moderate. To reduce max stress, try raising node_4 slightly and shifting horizontally for better triangulation and stiffness.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing node_4 y increases stiffness, reducing member_1 compression. Shifting node_4 slightly right (increase x) reduces skew in force path from node_3 towards node_2 via node_4 and balances member forces. Too high y may increase member_3 and member_4 stresses.",
  "reasoning": "Member_1 is under highest compression due to load orientation. Elevating node_4 by ~0.15 to 0.2 units and shifting right by ~0.15 units increases load path stiffness and load distribution among members 3,4,5, reducing member_1 stress. Areas remain at '2' to maintain moderate mass and stiffness. Check if new node_4 position keeps total mass under 30. Node_3 and supports fixed; node_4 free to move inside triangle formed by node_1, node_2, node_3.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_4: (2.38, 2.43). Propose new node_4: (2.53, 2.65). Estimate member lengths:\nmember_1 length = |node_1-node_3| = 2.0,\nmember_3 length = sqrt((2.53-0)^2 + (2.65-0)^2) ≈3.67,\nmember_4 length = sqrt((6-2.53)^2 + (0-2.65)^2) ≈4.32,\nmember_5 length = sqrt((2.53-2)^2 + (2.65-0)^2) ≈2.68.\nMass sum = sum(lengths × area 0.782) ≈ (2 + 3.67 + 4.32 + 2 + 2.68)*0.782 ≈ total mass within limit.\nExpect slight stress reduction on member_1 due to better load path.",
  "calculation": "New node_4 (2.53, 2.65). Member_1 length: 2.0;\nMember_3 length: 3.67;\nMember_4 length: 4.32;\nMember_5 length: 2.68;\nApprox mass = (2 + 3.67 + 4.32 + 2 + 2.68)*0.782 = ~11.99 mass units (lower than current 12.68). Reducing mass slightly and increasing height improves performance.\nMember areas remain '2'. Expect max stress <= previous 14.95 due to increased height and more optimal triangle.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved right and up modestly; within constraints. Triangulation improved. Mass reduced. Stress likely reduced below previous max. Proceed with this design iteration.",
