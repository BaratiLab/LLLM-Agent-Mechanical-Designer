By adjusting node_4 closer to node_3 and slightly up, we can reduce force demand in member_1 and member_5 while keeping a stable geometry. Past trend: lowering node_4 y from 3.0 to 2.7 reduced total mass and modulated stresses, but max stress rose slightly. Need fine-tune node_4 position to reduce stress under max 20 and potentially reduce mass. Areas remain at 2 (0.782) which seems balanced. Avoid increasing area as mass is budgeted comfortably.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Shifting node_4 horizontally impacts member_3 and member_4 lengths and force flow. Enlarging triangle height increases member_3 tension but reduces compression in members linked to node_1. Lowering node_4 vertically decreases lever arm reducing member_3 stress but may cause lateral instability.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Keeping existing members and area assignment, optimize node_4 position to minimize max stress by balancing forces. Moving node_4 closer to node_3 horizontally (toward 2.2) and lowering vertically to about 2.5 might reduce stress while preserving truss closure and stability (4 members connected at node_4). This will shorten member_3 and member_5, potentially reducing stresses there. Member_1 length also reduces. Check mass, likely decreased or nearly constant. Areas remain same, no capacity added to keep mass low.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Try node_4 coordinates near (2.2, 2.5):\\n- member_1 length ≈ sqrt((2.2)^2 + (2.5)^2) ~3.33\\n- member_5 length ≈ sqrt((2.0 - 2.2)^2 + (0.0 - 2.5)^2) ~2.5;\\nArea 0.782, mass proportional to member lengths.\\nEstimate stress decrease due to shorter lengths and reduced moment arms from loads.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Move node_4 to (2.18, 2.5) to balance shorter member_1 and member_5, reduce max compressive stress ~14.7 to hopefully below 13.5.
