  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress under limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max_stress 15.36 < 20, total_mass 12.79 < 30. Loaded at node_3, supports fixed. We can only move node_4 to optimize.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress occurs mainly in member_1 (-15.36), which is compressed. Members around node_4 have moderate tensile/compressive stresses. Node_4 moved downward from earlier iterations to near current 2.6,2.48. The slight increase in stress from prior iterations suggests node_4 elevation and horizontal position affect member_1 and member_5 stress. We want to reduce compressive stress in member_1 and tensile in member_3 while keeping mass and constraints satisfied.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Trade-off between vertical position and horizontal position of node_4: too high increases tensile stress in member_3, too low causes instability and higher stress in member_1 compressive. Need to try lowering node_4 slightly and shifting horizontally left to reduce shear force on member_1.",

  "reasoning": "1) Lower node_4 y from 2.48 to ~2.3 will reduce tensile force on members 3 and 4.\n2) Shift node_4 left slightly from x=2.6 to ~2.5 decreases moment arm and reduces compression in member_1.\n3) Keep member areas at '2' (0.782) as current to maintain mass under 30 and avoid increasing stresses due to smaller area.\n4) Members remain the same, closed truss remains.\n5) Vertex fixities and load unchanged.\n6) These small adjustments historically lowered max stress and mass.\n7) Expect max stress near 14-15 with this position.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4: (2.5, 2.3). Member lengths recomputed approximately:\nm5 length ~ sqrt((2 - 2.5)^2 + (0 - 2.3)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 5.29) ~ 2.33m\nMember_1 length ~ sqrt((2 - 0)^2 + 0) = 2m fixed\nMember_3 length ~ sqrt((2.5 - 0)^2 + 2.3^2) ~ 3.4m\nEstimate stress reduction in member_1 compressive and member_5 tension due to reduced lever arm.",

  "calculation": "Adjusted node_4 coordinates to (2.5, 2.3). Members unchanged.\nAreas all set to '2' (0.782) to keep mass consistent.\nMass approx similar ~12.7 - 13.\nExpected max stress decrease to ~14.8 - 15 from 15.36.\nNo violation of max stress Â±20 or mass <30.\nStructure closed and stable.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no node duplicates, node_4 distinct and load/support fixed. Members all connected correctly with area '2'. No duplication in members. Design adheres to constraints. Improvement expected. Further major improvement unlikely with current 4-node system. Recommend continuing small moves or stop if next iteration confirms no better stress.",
