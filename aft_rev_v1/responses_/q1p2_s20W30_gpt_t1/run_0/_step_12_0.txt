  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position and member areas to reduce max stress while respecting mass and stress limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Goal is to reduce max stress (currently 15.59) below previous best (~13.35) while keeping mass < 30 and stress ≤ ±20. Nodes at load/support fixed except node_4 movable. Member areas chosen from given discrete set, currently '2' (0.782).",
  
  "analysis": "Current design has node_4 at (2.5, 2.3) with uniform area 0.782 for all members. Max compressive stress is in member_1 (-15.59), tensile in member_3 (8.9). Mass is low at 12.46, well below max 30. Stress is close to limits but still under 20. Prior iterations show max stress can be reduced to ~13.3 by changing node_4 vertical position ~3.5 while mass increased to 14.69. Higher node_4 increases member lengths and mass. Current lower node_4 gives low mass but higher stress. Stress in member_1 compressive large, likely due to short length and load distribution. Slight repositioning of node_4 may reduce stress on member_1 and member_3, improving force flow.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Move node_4 slightly up and right to balance forces, increase area selectively in high stress members (member_1) or reduce area in low stress members to keep mass. Consider increasing member_1 area from '2' (0.782) to '3' (1.759) to reduce its stress. Keep other members at '2' to control mass. Aim to keep mass under 15 to keep margin for area changes.",

  "reasoning": "Increasing area of member_1 reduces stress (-15.59) by increasing capacity. Simultaneously, node_4 upward shift from 2.3 to ~2.7 redistributes load reducing compressive stress on member_1 and tensile on member_3. Moving node_4 right slightly to ~2.7 keeps symmetrical force paths. Total mass increase expected ~1 to 1.5 units due to larger area and slightly longer members but still under 30. This trade-off is acceptable to reduce max stress below 14. Retain closed truss with 5 members connecting all four nodes to keep structure stable.",  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approx: member_1 length = distance from (0,0) to node_3 (2,0) = 2; member_3 length = distance from (0,0) to node_4 (~2.7,2.7) ≈ 3.82; member_5 length approx= distance between node_3 (2,0) and node_4 (~2.7,2.7) ≈ 2.89; Update member_1 area to '3' (1.759) from '2' (0.782). Mass for member_1 = length × area = 2 ×1.759=3.518 vs old 2×0.782=1.564; mass ups by ~1.95. Other members stay at area '2' with total mass roughly 12.46 - 1.564 + 3.518 ≈ 14.4, still well below 30. Expect stress reduction in member_1 by ~55% due to doubling area. Node_4 moved to (2.7,2.7) to relieve stress concentrations and even force distribution.",

  "calculation": "Updated node_4 = (2.7, 2.7). Member areas: member_1: '3' (1.759), others at '2' (0.782). Estimated mass: member_1: 3.518, member_2: ~4.7 (3.128m × 0.782 area), member_3: ~3 (3.82 × 0.782), member_4: ~3.7 (4.2 × 0.782), member_5: ~2.3(2.89 × 0.782). Total mass ~14.4. Estimated max stress member_1 reduces to ~-7.5 to -8. Member_3 tensile stress reduce slightly by better node_4 pos. Other members unchanged. All within constraints.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Design respects constraints max stress ±20, max mass 30. Node_4 reposition reduces stress and balances structure. Member_1 area increased effectively reduces max compressive stress. No other nodes moved to keep load/support fixed. Closed truss topology maintained with 5 members. Stress likely minimized further with current constraints. Optimization should continue for few iterations but major redesign unnecessary.",
