Member lengths and angles affect stress distribution. Improving geometry by repositioning node_4 slightly upward-right may reduce stress in member_3 and also balance force paths. Adjust area of member_3 to maintain low mass but higher capacity, change from area 2(0.782) to 3(1.759) or vice versa in other members to balance.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try increasing node_4 y to ~2.5â€“2.6 and adjusting x slightly to ~2.5; increase member_3 area to 3 to reduce stress.

Maintain load/support nodes fixed.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Because max stress is at members 1 and 3, changing node_4 to relieve stress on member_3 is optimal. Area id 3 (1.759) has been used before, switching member_3 to area 3 should reduce stress. Current highest stress is tensile 8.81, well below limit 20. Mass budget allows increasing some areas.
