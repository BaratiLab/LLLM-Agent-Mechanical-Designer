  "preamble": "Current 2D truss is within stress and mass limits with balanced nodal positions and member areas.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective is to minimize max stress while maintaining mass under 30 and max stress ±20. Nodes at load/support fixed. Current max stress ~8.24 < 20, mass ~17.5 < 30.",
  "analysis": "The truss has node_4 elevated at (2.42, 2.6), supporting load at node_3 with a force at -45°. Member areas vary but mostly 2 or 3, indicating moderate section selection (area ids). Stress is well below limits, no member near max capacity. Further reductions in max stress without increasing mass seem unlikely given already low stress and sufficient mass. Geometry changes limited as load/support nodes fixed, and small node_4 moves previously tested with no improvement beyond 8 max stress.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_4 position and member areas have been iteratively optimized over many steps. Max stress around 8.2, stable. Mass ~17.5, half limit. Could reduce area for mass but would risk increasing stress. Current design balanced between mass and stress, no hotspots near stress limits.",
  "reasoning": "Since max stress is comfortably below limit and mass well under max, optimization appears converged. Further node adjustments to node_4 within feasible range do not reduce stress significantly. Areas used reflect reasonable balance. Stress signs indicate no compressive member near limit either. Structural behavior stable and well-distributed. Optimization should stop to avoid unnecessary complexity or overfitting.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "No members exceed stress ±20. Total mass well below 30. Node_4 is free to move within load/support constraints but prior iterations show changes worsen stress or mass. Area sizes selected from given set, no zeros used (which would reduce mass but raise stress). Forces and reactions are consistent with stable configuration.",
  "calculation": "No changes suggested; node positions and member areas satisfy constraints and objective. Max stress: 8.24 < 20, Total mass 17.5163 < 30. No member area reductions advisable given stress margins. Node_4 at (2.42,2.6) provides good load path. Member areas {3,2,3,2,3} minimize stress and keep mass moderate.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Design verified against constraints. Further moves or area changes likely suboptimal or violate constraints. Stop criterion met.",
