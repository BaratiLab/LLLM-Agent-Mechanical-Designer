Load at node_3, supports fixed at node_1 and node_2.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max compressive stress is high on member_1 (-15.67). To reduce stress, redistribute forces by altering node_4 position, as node_1, node_2, and node_3 positions fixed by constraints or loading/support. Move node_4 to change force path and member lengths.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Shortening high-stress member length or changing angle to reduce axial stress. Also check that changing node_4 position keeps the structure closed and stable. Adjust member areas if needed for better stress distribution.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Node_4 raised from 3.0 to 3.3 y lowered max stress from 14.21 to 15.67 but reduced mass. Possibly need to move node_4 slightly left and/or down to balance tensile and compressive stresses, keeping structure stable. Current member_1 stress is most critical (-15.67). Reducing its effective length or load path could help. Member areas mostly moderate, reconsider assigning member_1 area to 3 or 4 to reduce stress effects or adjusting geometry for improved force transfer.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculations, force path considerations, and allowable areas from given area set. Avoid large area increases as mass limit exists. Move node_4 slightly left (reduce x) and slightly down (reduce y) to reduce tension/compression in long members. Maintain closed triangular structure with nodes (1,3,4) and (2,3,4). Mass must stay under 30.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Shift node_4 from (3.3,3.0) to (2.85, 2.7). This reduces member_1 length slightly and changes angles in members 3,4,5 for better stress distribution. Keep existing member connections. Areas mostly unchanged: member_1 and member_2 area \'2\', member_3 and member_5 area \'3\', member_4 area \'2\'.
