  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress under constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 9.89 < 20 and mass 15.97 < 30. Node_4 moved closer slightly from previous, stress shifted but max stress 9.89 at member_3 (node_1-node_4) and member_1 (node_1-node_3).",
  
  "analysis": "Load at node_3 causes high tensile stress at member_3 and compressive stress at member_1. Members_3 and 1 carry major load. Member areas currently 3 for member_1 and member_5, 2 for member_2,4,3. Total mass moderate at 15.97. Stress not minimized enough. Increasing node_4 height can help reduce axial force in member_3 by improving force distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_1 and node_2 fixed per supports. Node_3 fixed at x=2.0, y=0. Node_4 free to move in x/y. Current node_4 at (2.6, 2.0). Idea: increase y of node_4 slightly (e.g. 2.2 to 2.4) to reduce stress in member_3 by reducing its axial force. Also consider slight change in x of node_4 toward node_3 (between 2.0 and 2.6) to improve force triangle. Possibly adjust area of member_3 to '3' or higher if stress persists.",
  
  "reasoning": "Based on truss mechanics, increasing height of the loaded node above the base reduces bending, increasing axial force in diagonal members but reduces max stress if area is properly assigned. Member_3 currently at area 2, could increase to area 3 if needed, but prefer to keep mass down. Slightly increasing height should reduce compressive stresses in member_1 and tensile stresses in member_3. Member_5 is area 3, carries moderate compressive stress - keep same. Member_2,4 are area 2, moderate stresses - keep same.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress balance: max stress member_3 at 9.887 (tension), member_1 -7.50 (compression). Member_5 stress at -4.19 compression, area 3. Member_2 and 4 less stressed. By increasing node_4 height from 2.0 to ~2.3, member_3 lengthens, reducing axial force to achieve lower stress. Check mass remains under 30. Mass increment from bigger member_3 length offset by removing possible redundant cross sectional increase.",
  
  "calculation": "Current member lengths: \n- member_1 length ~ distance(0,0)-(2,0) = 2.0\n- member_3 length ~ distance(0,0)-(2.6,2.0) = sqrt(2.6^2+2^2) ~ 3.28\nIf node_4 moved to (2.3,2.3), member_3 length = sqrt(2.3^2 + 2.3^2) = 3.25 (similar)\nPolicy: move node_4 to (2.3, 2.3) to improve force distribution.\nMember areas: keep current (3,2,2,2,3) for members 1-5 respectively.\nEstimate mass roughly similar, under 30.\nAnticipate max stress reduced to ~8-9.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Move node_4 to (2.3, 2.3). Keep member areas same. Anticipate decreased max stress and acceptable mass. Continue optimization until max stress near minimum achievable with current topology and nodes.",
