  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress ~8.35 is well below ±20 limit; mass 17.1 <30 limit. Areas currently used: member_1 and member_5 (area 3), others mostly area 2. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Goal: Reduce max stress further if possible by repositioning node_4 without changing load/support nodes or topology.",
  
  "analysis": "The critical tensile stress is in member_3 (node_1-node_4) at +8.35. Compression stresses are moderate. The trend over prior iterations shows reducing node_4 vertical coordinate reduces stress but mass also varies. Current node_4 at (2.35,2.45) yields balanced stress distribution but member_3 stress is still the highest tensile. Slight adjustment of node_4 position towards centroid of nodes could improve force distribution, reducing peak stress. Member areas and connectivity seem optimal given constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_4 slightly lower and slightly to the right to reduce tension in member_3 and balance stresses in member_4 and member_5. Keep node_4 above node_3 to maintain structural stability and avoid increase in mass. Small incremental moves preferable to prevent stress spikes.",

  "reasoning": "Member_3 tensile stress is highest; moving node_4 closer horizontally to node_3 reduces length and tension. Moving node_4 slightly down trades off tension and compression among members. Member_1 and member_5 are compression and tension members working together; their stress values are moderate and balanced. Areas are assigned with larger cross-section for critical members (1 and 5). Further area increase would increase mass impractically. Node_4 repositioning is best approach to reduce peak stress.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Evaluate small horizontal and vertical node_4 coordinate shifts. Calculate approximate member lengths to estimate stress effect. Current lengths: member_3 ≈ sqrt((2.35)^2 + (2.45)^2) ≈ 3.39; reducing length may reduce stress. Member_1 length  ≈ 2.69 current. Member_5 length roughly from node_3(2,0) to node_4(2.35,2.45) is about 2.6. Fine tuning position may smooth axial forces.",
  
  "calculation": "Shift node_4 from (2.35, 2.45) to (2.45, 2.30) reduces member_3 length to sqrt(2.45^2 + 2.30^2) ≈ 3.36 slightly shorter. This should decrease tensile force. Member_5 length ≈ sqrt((2.45-2)^2 + (2.30-0)^2) ≈ 2.33 reducing compression slightly. Member_4 length roughly sqrt((6-2.45)^2 + (0-2.30)^2) ≈ 4.3, minimal effect but stress reduction possible due to favorable geometry. Member_1 length unchanged at 2.0 to 0.0 and 2.0 to 0.0, 2.0 distance 2.0. Member_2 unchanged. Areas kept same to avoid mass increase. Mass should stay constant or drop slightly as member lengths shorten. Max stress likely to drop below 8.35.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes or members. All node positions precise floats. Existing nodes for load/support unchanged. Same member connections maintained with same areas. Constraints remain satisfied with lower max stress and mass well below limits. Continue optimization in next iterations if improvement observed.",
