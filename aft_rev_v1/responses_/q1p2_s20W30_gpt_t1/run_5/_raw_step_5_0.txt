Total mass 18.66 well below max 30. Members mostly area 2 or 3. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved slightly each iteration to reduce stress and mass.",\n  "analysis": "Max stress at member_1 (-16.35) is close to limit; member_3 and member_5 have moderate tension around 4.2 and -4.3. Previous moves of node_4 down and to left decreased mass but increased stress, vice versa. Member_1 area is 2, length ~2.75 (node_1 to node_3). Possibly increase area of member_1 to reduce stress or slightly move node_4 horizontally to improve force distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing area in highly stressed member_1 reduces stress, but increases mass. Moving node_4 closer towards node_3 lowers stress in member_1 by redistributing load. Keep area for member_2 and member_4 as 2 for mass efficiency, reduce member_3 and member_5 to area 2 from 3 to save mass, assuming no stress violation.",\n  "reasoning": "Member_1 stress of -16.35 implies high compressive force; increasing area to 3 reduces stress inversely proportional to area while adding small mass. Moving node_4 slightly closer horizontally and a bit down reduces bending moment. Lowering area in members 3 and 5 saves mass with minor stress increase. Member_2 and member_4 remain at area 2 for load bearing. Node_3 fixed; Node_4 only adjustable free node. Final configuration balances these trade-offs.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Approximate length(node_1-node_4) ~ sqrt((2.85^2)+(2.35^2))=3.72, node_3 to node_4 ~ sqrt((0.85^2)+(2.35-0)^2)= about 2.5; moving node_4 left to 2.7 and down to 2.1 reduces leverage. Member masses calculated as length*area_value. Areas chosen among given ids, balancing mass and stress.",\n  "calculation": "Move node_4 from (2.85, 2.35) to (2.7, 2.1). Set member_1 area from \'2\' to \'3\' to reduce stress on high compression member. Members 3 and 5 area from \'3\' to \'2\' to save mass. Members 2 and 4 area kept \'2\'.
