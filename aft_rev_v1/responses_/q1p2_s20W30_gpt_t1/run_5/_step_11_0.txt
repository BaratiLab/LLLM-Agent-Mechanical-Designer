  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to lower max stress while keeping constraints valid.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 8.81 < 20, mass 16.7 < 30, structure appears stable but stress mostly on members 1,3,4. node_4 moved downward and slightly left in last iteration to reduce stress.",

  "analysis": "Stress in members 1 and 3 are highest (6.87 compressive and 8.81 tensile). member_3 area is 2, possibly limiting capacity there. Member lengths and angles affect stress distribution. Improving geometry by repositioning node_4 slightly upward-right may reduce stress in member_3 and also balance force paths. Adjust area of member_3 to maintain low mass but higher capacity, change from area 2(0.782) to 3(1.759) or vice versa in other members to balance.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Try increasing node_4 y to ~2.5â€“2.6 and adjusting x slightly to ~2.5; increase member_3 area to 3 to reduce stress. Decrease area on member_5 from 3 to 2 to reduce mass while keeping strength in other members. Maintain load/support nodes fixed.",

  "reasoning": "Because max stress is at members 1 and 3, changing node_4 to relieve stress on member_3 is optimal. Area id 3 (1.759) has been used before, switching member_3 to area 3 should reduce stress. Current highest stress is tensile 8.81, well below limit 20. Mass budget allows increasing some areas. Balancing cross-sectional area and node placement optimizes mass and stress.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: \n- member_1 length ~ sqrt((2.0-0)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 2.0\n- member_3 length ~ sqrt((x4-0)^2 + (y4-0)^2)\nSet node_4 = (2.55, 2.55)\nMember_3 length ~2.55^2 + 2.55^2 = 3.606\nArea 3 = 1.759\nMass member_3 = length x area ~ 6.34, acceptable within total mass\nAdjust other member areas accordingly with no duplicates in connections.",

  "calculation": "Update node_4 to (2.55, 2.55)\nMember areas: member_1: 3 (1.759), member_2: 2 (0.782), member_3: 3 (1.759), member_4: 2 (0.782), member_5: 2 (0.782)\nEstimate mass:\n- member_1 length: 2.0, mass=2.0*1.759=3.518\n- member_2 length: 4.0, mass=4.0*0.782=3.128\n- member_3 length: sqrt(2.55^2+2.55^2)=3.606; mass=3.606*1.759=6.34\n- member_4 length: sqrt((6-2.55)^2+2.55^2)=sqrt(3.45^2+2.55^2)= approx 4.3; mass=4.3*0.782=3.36\n- member_5 length: distance node_3(2,0) to node_4(2.55,2.55)=sqrt(0.55^2+2.55^2)=2.6; mass=2.6*0.782=2.03\nTotal mass ~3.52+3.13+6.34+3.36+2.03=18.38 (<30)\nExpected max stress reduces due to higher area on member_3 and balanced geometry.\nCheck force path with increased node_4 height distributing load efficiently.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "New design respects constraints: max stress expected below 9 (well below 20); mass ~18.38 <30\nNode_4 repositioned to (2.55, 2.55)\nAreas balanced with priority to highly stressed members.\nNo violation of instructions: load/support nodes fixed; no duplicate members; precise floats used.",
