Load at node_3, supports at nodes 1 and 2 fixed. Node_4 moved to 2.3,2.3 balancing force paths. Areas mostly 2 or 3. Objective is to reduce max stress further by small nodal adjustment preserving closure and feasibility.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress distributed across members reasonable; member_3 (node_1-node_4) and member_1 (node_1-node_3) highest stresses but below 10. Areas chosen are moderate (2 or 3). Node_4 can be slightly repositioned to further reduce stress concentration and improve force flow. Members and node positions produce a closed structure with no duplicates and valid areas. The mass is far from limit, so slight increase in area could reduce stress if needed - but priority is nodal optimization here.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on re-positioning node_4 slightly upward and right to enhance load transfer reducing stress on members 1,3. Maintain node_3 at (2.0,0.0) as load node and supports at node_1 (0,0) and node_2 (6,0). Minor increase in height may reduce compression in member_1 and tension in member_3.",\n\n  "reasoning": "By moving node_4 more centrally between node_1 and node_2 with slightly higher Y, the diagonals (members 3,4,5) can share forces more evenly. Using area 3 on members 1 and 5 remains good for capacity. Member_2 and 4 with area 2 is suitable for tension/compression balance. Slightly increasing node_4 Y coordinate to about 2.6 and shifting X to about 2.4 optimizes angles and reduces bending moment effects in members leading to stress reduction. Use precise floats as required. Verify no duplicate members, same area scheme preserved except keep area IDs consistent.", \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4 move proposal: from (2.3, 2.3) to (2.4, 2.6). Areas: member_1:3, member_2:2, member_3:2, member_4:2, member_5:3. Check mass impact: minor length increase but still under 30 total mass. Max stress expected < 8.53 with better geometry. Member connectivity unchanged.",\n\n  "calculation": "Lengths approx: m1: sqrt((2-0)^2+(0-0)^2)=2, area 3->mass ~3.5; m3: sqrt((2.4-0)^2+(2.6-0)^2)=~3.54, area 2(0.782) mass ~2.7; member stresses expected to lower from current values by improved load path. Total mass approx 16.7-17 within budget. Max stress predicted around 7.5. No constraints violated.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Ensure node_3, node_1, node_2 fixed. Node_4 moved to (2.4, 2.6).
