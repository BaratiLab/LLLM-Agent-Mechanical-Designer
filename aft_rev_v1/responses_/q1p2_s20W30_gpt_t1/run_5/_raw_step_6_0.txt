Current max stress is 9.82, well below limit, total mass 14.11 far below max. Controlling member areas and node_4 relocation can reduce max tensile stress around node_4.",\n  "analysis": "Current stress distribution has max tensile stress 9.8189 (member_3), compressive max -9.5314 (member_5). Node_4 moved closer causing reduced geometry size and reduced mass. Areas on other members can be reduced since mass is low. Member_3 area reduced from 3 to 2 decreased mass but increased stress, so maybe slight adjustment in node_4 vertical/horizontal position can reduce stresses.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Check if moving node_4 slightly horizontally or vertically affects member_3 and member_5 stresses. Smaller area on member_3 increases stress, so reposition node_4 to reduce force in member_3 and member_5. Also, member_3 originally had area 3 but member_5 area 2 with high compression. Consider increasing member_5 area to 3 and reducing member_3 area to 2, or vice versa.",\n  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 closer to node_3 and slightly lowering its height can reduce tensile stress in member_3 and compressive in member_5, balancing forces better. Member_3 and member_5 share node_4 and node_3. Optimally, node_4 position handles axial forces better if it forms a more vertical or ideal triangular geometry. Given that node_1 and node_2 fixed supports and node_3 load position fixed, only node_4 adjustment possible. Adjust areas of members 3 and 5 to balance stress/tension, possibly member_5 area to 3 and member_3 area to 2 or 1 if stress allows.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculations for new node_4 positions with formulas: length = sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2).
