  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss node positions to reduce max stress and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: minimize max stress <20, mass <30. Nodes 1,2 fixed support/load; node_4 moved iteratively to reduce stresses, mass lowered steadily from 22.8 to 19.8. Current max stress 15.41 under limit.",
  "analysis": "Current design keeps constraints with max stress = 15.41 and total mass = 19.82. Node_4 moved closer to lower elevation/coordinate 2.85,2.7 from 3.3,3.0 previously, which lowered mass and stress. Member areas mostly low-middle range. Compression member_1 still close to max stress at ~15.4.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress reduced by lowering node_4 height and moving horizontally closer towards node_3 side (2.85 vs 3.3). Member_1 under compression still high, suggests load path length or force redistribution possible. Better distribution needed without violating support or load node positions.",
  "reasoning": "To reduce max compression on member_1 (-15.4), slightly move node_4 closer horizontally to node_1, and lower vertical coordinate to reduce bending moment. This will shorten compression member_1 length slightly, reducing stress. Also, adjust member areas - consider reducing area of low stress tension members to save mass and increase area of critical compression members selectively from area set. Keep all members closed and consistent connectivity. Avoid increasing mass beyond 20 as current is 19.82 with scope.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths calculated from node coordinates; mass proportional to length Ã— area. Stress statically depends on geometry. Node_4 at (2.85, 2.7) optimized so far. Try (2.75, 2.45). Adjust member area map: member_1 area from '2'(0.782) to '3'(1.759) to reduce stress. Others keep or reduce slightly if low stress.",
  "calculation": "New node_4 position: x=2.75, y=2.45. Member areas: member_1: '3'(1.759) to reduce compression stress, member_2 & 4: '2'(0.782), member_3 & 5: '3'(1.759) as before. Estimate resulting mass < 21, max stress expected to reduce to ~14 due to increased area and geometry adjustment. This respects constraints, improves distribution, and keeps design closed.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no nodal position change on nodes 1,2,3; only node_4 adjusted. Members unique, existing connectivity maintained. Stress expected below 20, mass below 30. Stops only when stress improvements negligible in later steps.",
