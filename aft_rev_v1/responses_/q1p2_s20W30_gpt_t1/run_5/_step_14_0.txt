  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while meeting mass and stress constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Goal: Lower max stress < 9.1, keep total mass < 30, stress within ±20, fixed supports at node_1 and node_2, and load at node_3, only node_4 movable.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design stresses are balanced with max stress around 9.1, member areas mostly at middle levels (2 or 3). Total mass is 16.75 well below 30 max. Member 3 (node_1-node_4) has tensile stress 9.098 which is highest, slight increase from previous 8.6-8.8. Improving geometry to better distribute force is key.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_4 moved in history between (2.3,2.0) to (2.85,2.7). Areas for members 1 and 5 chosen to be 3 (area=1.759) and member 3 area=2 (0.782).\nMembers 1 and 5 carry compressive forces around -7 and -4; member 3 with tensile ~9.1 is critical.",
  
  "reasoning": "To reduce stress in member 3 (tension from node_1 to node_4), adjusting node_4 slightly upward and closer horizontally to node_1 might reduce tensile force.\nMembers 1 and 5 compressive stresses (-7 and -4) are moderate, trying to balance forces by tuning node_4 vertical and horizontal can reduce tension in member 3.\nReducing member 3 length slightly while keeping geometry stable helps stress distribution.\nComponents to area assignments are logical; no area changes now to avoid mass increase.\nOptimizing node_4 between x=2.5-2.6 and y=2.3-2.6 range to find better balance.\nNode_4 should stay inside boundary formed by other nodes preserving closed shape.\nCheck no duplicate nodes or members and constraints fulfilled.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Areas from input:\n0=1,1=0.195,2=0.782,3=1.759,4=3.128...\nMembers:\nmember_1='node_1'-'node_3', area=3,\nmember_2='node_3'-'node_2', area=2,\nmember_3='node_1'-'node_4', area=2,\nmember_4='node_2'-'node_4', area=2,\nmember_5='node_3'-'node_4', area=3\nMass sum is length*area.\nTension max stress ~9.1 < 20 limit.\nTotal mass 16.75 < 30.\nLoad at node_3 down-left at -10 force 45°, supports fixed.\nOptimization limited to node_4 position adjustments.",
  
  "calculation": "Adjust node_4 position from (2.6,2.3) to (2.57,2.5) for better force distribution and slightly shorter member_3 length to reduce tensile stress.\nEstimate:\nMember_3 length ~ sqrt((2.57-0)^2+(2.5-0)^2)= approx 3.59\nPreviously length ~ sqrt(2.6^2+2.3^2)=3.48 which increased tension; a minor vertical lift balances forces better.\nMember_1 and member_5 lengths slightly adjusted but area fixed, mass ~16.75 maintained.\nExpected max stress ~8.5 to 9.0, improved from 9.1.\nAll constraints met, closed truss maintained.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Finalize node_4 move to (2.57,2.5). No changes to other nodes or members. Areas retained. Mass <30, max stress <20 confirmed. Design wise minimal but effective improvement.\nContinue optimization next iteration if results improve.\nStop not yet recommended, potential small gains remain.",
