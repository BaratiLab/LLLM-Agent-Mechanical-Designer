Current node_4 at (2.55, 2.55). Areas mostly 2 or 3; member_3 heavy with area 3. Member_5 stress highest compressive at -9.25.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design stable and within constraints, max stress well below ±20 and mass below 30. Highest compressive stress on member_5 (-9.25) with area 2. Tensile stress lower and acceptable. Node_1 and node_2 fixed; node_3 fixed load. Node_4 moved upward over iterations to distribute stresses better. Member areas are coarse magnitude: possible slight area swaps to reduce area of lower stress members and increase area of overloaded ones carefully.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Check if moving node_4 slightly to further balance forces can reduce peak stresses. Consider increasing area of member_5 from 2 to 3 to lower stress, but mass will increase. Alternatively, optimize node_4 position to reduce stress concentration on member_5. Member_3 currently area 3 with low tensile stress (3.79), maybe shrinking it to area 2 can save mass and increase member_5 area without rising max stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Since max stress on member_5 (-9.25) is compressive, increasing its area reduces stress proportionally. Reducing member_3 area reduces mass, allowing higher area for member_5 with minimal mass penalty. Moving node_4 closer horizontally toward node_3 may reduce bending stress on members 4 and 5. Aim for precise node_4 around (2.5-2.6, 2.4-2.5).",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Current lengths and mass: member_3 long (from node_1(0,0) to node_4(2.55, 2.55)) ~3.6 m. Member_5 shorter (node_3(2,0) to node_4(2.55,2.55)) ~2.57 m. Area change: area 2=0.782, area3=1.759. Mass proportional to length×area. Swapping member_3 to area 2 saves approx 6.3434 - 2.82 = 3.5 mass units. Increasing member_5 from area 2 to area 3 adds 2.57*(1.759 -0.782) ~2.57*0.977=2.5 mass units, net mass reduction ~1.0, good margin. Slight node_4 downward shift to around y=2.45-2.5 can help.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Change member_3 area from \'3\' (1.759) to \'2\' (0.782). Change member_5 area from \'2\' (0.782) to \'3\' (1.759). Node_4 shifted from (2.55, 2.55) to (2.53, 2.47) to reduce bending moments. Validate all constraints: mass <30, stresses expected to reduce max compressive on member_5 due to larger area; tensile stress on member_3 increases slightly but remains low. Mass recalculated roughly around 17.0-18.0, max stress expected <9.0.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Optimized node_4 position and area assignment balance stress better, reduce peak compressive stress on member_5.
