Load at node3, supports fixed; only node4 movable. Areas balanced with mostly area 2 and 3.",\n  "analysis": "Max compressive and tensile stresses are low relative to allowed ±20. Most critical member is member_3 (node1-node4) at tensile 9.09, and member_1 with compression -7.04. Mass is moderate at 16.9, room under max 30. To reduce stress further, can optimize geometry by moving node_4 slightly to redistribute forces in members without increasing length too much. Member areas seem adequate; no change recommended to member area IDs.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Small vertical or horizontal shifts of node_4 could reduce peak tension in member_3 and compression in member_1. Avoid increasing length drastically. Avoid lowering height too much as it may increase stress in bottom chord. Member_3 tensile is high; increasing angle of member_3 or decreasing length may help.",\n  "reasoning": "Increasing vertical height of node_4 slightly and shifting horizontally closer to node_3 reduces member_3 length and potentially reduces tensile stress. At same time, check that compression in member_1 is not increased. Member_5 area is largest (3), likely for diagonal stability; keep as is. Try moving node_4 slightly upward and left (reduce x from 2.65 towards 2.4, increase y from 2.35 to ~2.6) to reduce tensile stress in member_3 and compressive stress in member_1 further while maintaining geometric stability.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths and expected stress impact: Current length of member_3 between node_1(0,0) and node_4(2.65,2.35) ~ sqrt(2.65²+2.35²)=3.54. Reducing horizontal to 2.4 and increasing vertical to 2.6 gives length ~ sqrt(2.4²+2.6²) = 3.54 similar, but angle improves axial force distribution. Small adjustment preserves mass ~16.9, stress expected to reduce. Retain current member areas: member_1 = 3, member_2=2, member_3=2, member_4=2, member_5=3.",\n  "calculation": "Assign node_4 coordinates: x=2.42, y=2.6. Members unchanged. Expect marginal stress improvement by geometry favoring less force on member_3 tensile and member_1 compression. Mass will remain under max 30. Stress load redistribution beneficial. No other node moves allowed.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicates; node_4 moved within allowed range with refined coordinates. Member connections and areas unchanged.
