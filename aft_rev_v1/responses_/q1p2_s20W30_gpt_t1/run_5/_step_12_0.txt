  "preamble": "Minimizing max stress within constraints by fine-tuning node_4 position and areas.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective to reduce max stress < 9.25 while keeping total mass under 30. Current node_4 at (2.55, 2.55). Areas mostly 2 or 3; member_3 heavy with area 3. Member_5 stress highest compressive at -9.25.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design stable and within constraints, max stress well below ±20 and mass below 30. Highest compressive stress on member_5 (-9.25) with area 2. Tensile stress lower and acceptable. Node_1 and node_2 fixed; node_3 fixed load. Node_4 moved upward over iterations to distribute stresses better. Member areas are coarse magnitude: possible slight area swaps to reduce area of lower stress members and increase area of overloaded ones carefully.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Check if moving node_4 slightly to further balance forces can reduce peak stresses. Consider increasing area of member_5 from 2 to 3 to lower stress, but mass will increase. Alternatively, optimize node_4 position to reduce stress concentration on member_5. Member_3 currently area 3 with low tensile stress (3.79), maybe shrinking it to area 2 can save mass and increase member_5 area without rising max stress.",
  
  "reasoning": "Since max stress on member_5 (-9.25) is compressive, increasing its area reduces stress proportionally. Reducing member_3 area reduces mass, allowing higher area for member_5 with minimal mass penalty. Moving node_4 closer horizontally toward node_3 may reduce bending stress on members 4 and 5. Aim for precise node_4 around (2.5-2.6, 2.4-2.5).",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current lengths and mass: member_3 long (from node_1(0,0) to node_4(2.55, 2.55)) ~3.6 m. Member_5 shorter (node_3(2,0) to node_4(2.55,2.55)) ~2.57 m. Area change: area 2=0.782, area3=1.759. Mass proportional to length×area. Swapping member_3 to area 2 saves approx 6.3434 - 2.82 = 3.5 mass units. Increasing member_5 from area 2 to area 3 adds 2.57*(1.759 -0.782) ~2.57*0.977=2.5 mass units, net mass reduction ~1.0, good margin. Slight node_4 downward shift to around y=2.45-2.5 can help.",
  
  "calculation": "Change member_3 area from '3' (1.759) to '2' (0.782). Change member_5 area from '2' (0.782) to '3' (1.759). Node_4 shifted from (2.55, 2.55) to (2.53, 2.47) to reduce bending moments. Validate all constraints: mass <30, stresses expected to reduce max compressive on member_5 due to larger area; tensile stress on member_3 increases slightly but remains low. Mass recalculated roughly around 17.0-18.0, max stress expected <9.0.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Optimized node_4 position and area assignment balance stress better, reduce peak compressive stress on member_5. Mass remains within limit. No duplicate nodes. Load and support nodes fixed. Member connections unchanged to maintain topology. Stresses and mass meet constraints robustly. Further improvements would be marginal, suggest stopping next iteration if results stable.",
