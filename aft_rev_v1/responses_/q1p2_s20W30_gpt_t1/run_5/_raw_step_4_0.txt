Load at node_3; supports fixed node_1 and node_2. Node_4 free to move. Current areas mostly 3 (1.759) and 2 (0.782).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Maximum stresses are well below allowable Â±20. Mass is below 30. Stress distribution suggests member_1 in compression (-7.0281) and within limits. Member_1 area is 3 (1.759); this member carries highest compressive stress; possible to reduce area slightly? Members around node_4 show moderate tensile stress (up to 5.0). Slight shifting of node_4 down and right may better align members and reduce stress further.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on slight node_4 reposition: current (2.75, 2.45), history moved down from 2.7 to 2.45 while reducing max stress. Consider small increase in x to 2.85 and adjustment of y ~2.35. Also try reducing area in member_1 from 3 to 2 to reduce mass, verify if stress remains below limits.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Node_4 movement can influence member angles, reducing bending and peak stresses. Reducing area for low stressed members cuts mass while maintaining strength. Member_1 stress magnitude is ~7, area 3 used; reducing area to 2 (0.782) lowers mass but stress may rise; low stress margin allows this cautiously. Members with stress near 5 remain area 2. Maintain closed truss with same member connectivity. Node_3 fixed (load), node_1 and node_2 fixed (supports). No duplicates allowed.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: member_1 length: sqrt((2.0-0)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 2.0; member_5 approx from (2.0,0) to (2.75,2.45) ~ sqrt(0.75^2 + 2.45^2) ~ 2.57; total mass = sum(length*area). Stress roughly proportional to load and geometry; small node moves can adjust force distribution. Adjust area: member_1 area 2 reduces mass from 3.518 to about 1.56 (from previous iteration). Confirm stress remains <20.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Adjusted node_4 to (2.85, 2.35) to better balance forces. Reduced member_1 area to \'2\' (0.782) to cut mass but check stress <20.
