  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress at 8.65 within Â±20 allowed. Total mass 17.28 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Need minimize max stress further by node_4 movement only.",
  
  "analysis": "Current max stress at member_3 (node_1-node_4, area 2) is 8.645 tensile, approaching top limit. Members around node_4 critical to load transfer: member_3, member_4, member_5. Increasing height of node_4 increases axial forces and stress in member_3. Lower height might reduce stress but must maintain structural integrity and stiffness. Member areas mostly fixed at optimal levels. Current member_1 (node_1-node_3) with higher area 3 good for compressive stress.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Lower node_4 slightly from y=2.50 to about y=2.3-2.4 may reduce tensile stress in member_3. Shift node_4 slightly right to balance forces and reduce bending moment on node_4 also helpful.",

  "reasoning": "Member_3 under tensile stress close to its limit suggests a need to reduce its axial load by altering geometry. Moving node_4 closer to the line between nodes 1 and 2 but downward will reduce vertical component in member_3, reducing its tensile stress. Member_5 also should maintain equilibrium; minor shifting in x-direction balances force. Member areas fixed as changes not instructed. Use node_4 x ~2.65 and y ~2.3 to 2.4 range as a compromise.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Area IDs retained for members as in current design. Node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed by instructions. Only node_4 moved. Area selections: member_3 area 2; member_5 area 3; member_1 area 3; member_2 area 2; member_4 area 2.",

  "calculation": "Previous topology and areas stable; max stress ~8.65. Lowering node_4 from 2.5 to about 2.35 while shifting x slightly to 2.65 expected to reduce max tensile stress, retaining balance, keeping mass nearly constant. Estimated slight mass reduction due to member length adjustments.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New node_4 position (2.65, 2.35) respects no change in load/support nodes, no duplicate members or nodes. Areas unchanged. Mass expected under 18. Constraints on stress and mass met. Continue optimization if improved reduction in max stress observed.",
