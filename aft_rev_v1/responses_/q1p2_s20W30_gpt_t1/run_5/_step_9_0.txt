  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: minimize max stress ≤ ±20, total mass ≤ 30; node_1 and node_2 fixed; node_3, node_4 movable; current max stress 8.2, mass 17.51, all constraints satisfied.",

  "analysis": "Max stress 8.2 well below limit. Current member_3 stress is tension 8.20, member_1 compressive -6.49. Mass usage moderate at 17.5 < 30. Node_4 moved upwards to 2.6 from previous 2.3; member areas moderate: mostly area '2' (~0.782) and '3'(1.759). Further small nodal adjustment could reduce tension on member_3 and compressive on member_1. Avoid large moves to prevent constraint violation or stress concentration.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_3 high tensile stress suggests node_4 may be slightly too far from node_1 in vertical direction, slight lowering could balance tension; member_1 compression moderate, may also benefit from slight nodal shift. Area selection mostly optimal; no members have excessive mass to reduce. Fine tune node_4 closer to node_3 might ease stress distribution.",

  "reasoning": "Detailed balance of forces: load at node_3 downward-left, induces tension in member_3, compression in member_1. By slightly lowering node_4, redistribution reduces stress in member_3 and member_1. Areas remain as currently optimal under mass and stress constraints. Members at node_4 to fixed supports maintained at smallest feasible effective areas to minimize mass while keeping stress low. Slight adjustment of node_4 from (2.4, 2.6) to around (2.3, 2.4) expected to lower max stress while staying within constraints. No need to alter members or add nodes as system is minimal closed truss.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Length(member_1) from node_1(0,0) to node_3(2,0) = 2.0; length(member_3) from node_1 to node_4 changes slightly with node_4 move. Area selected for member_3 can remain '2' for balance. Expected stress reduction by ~15%. Total mass will remain below 18, well below max 30. Check no member stress exceed ±20 post move.",

  "calculation": "New node_4 at (2.35, 2.45). Recalculate member lengths, areas unchanged, stresses estimated to drop max stress to ~7.0–7.5, mass ~17.2–17.5. No violation of support or load conditions. Members dictionary unchanged. Position adjustments small but effective.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Confirm constraints: max stress < 20, total mass < 30. Members connections consistent, no duplicates. Load/support nodes unchanged, nodal changes precise floats. Structure closed 2D truss maintained. Areas from allowed set retained. Optimization can continue with next iterations for fine tuning. Stop not recommended now.",
