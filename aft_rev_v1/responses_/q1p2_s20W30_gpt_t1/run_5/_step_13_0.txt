  "preamble": "Optimize nodal position of free node_4 to minimize max stress under constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 8.63 well below 20 limit; mass 17.18 below 30 max; load, supports unchanged; only node_4 movable.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_3 has highest tensile stress (8.63), others lower. Areas chosen provide good mass balance. Moving node_4 slightly can reduce stress concentrations by better force distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing height might reduce tensile stress on member_3; shifting horizontally might balance forces in diagonal members.",

  "reasoning": "Optimize node_4 position near current (2.53, 2.47). Lowering slightly can reduce elongation and tensile stress in member_3 and compressive stress in member_1. Minor horizontal shifts can improve stress uniformity. Keep members same; areas mostly optimal based on history.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Avoid lowering too much to not increase compression stresses beyond limit; aim for max stress ~8 or less; verify mass <30.",

  "calculation": "Propose node_4: (2.6, 2.3). This reduces vertical displacement from previous 2.47 to 2.3, somewhat lowering member_3 elongation, keeping horizontal near center for load transfer balance. Keep member areas same from iteration 12.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Check stresses roughly expected to decrease or remain; mass slightly reduced due to shorter member lengths. All constraints met.",
