Node_3 is load application point, node_1 and node_2 supports, node_3 between them on x-axis. No node reposition allowed. Add nodes if needed to create closed stable truss with low stresses while minimizing mass.",\n\n  "analysis": "Initial 3 nodes form a line (0,0), (2,0), (6,0). This is unstable for vertical loading at node_3. To form a stable closed truss, add a node above x-axis to create a triangular structure. A triangle connecting node_1, node_2, and new node_4 elevated in y direction will create a stable frame. Then connect node_3 to node_4 to form sub-triangle. Members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_4. This allows the vertical load at node_3 to resolve through diagonal members, minimizing stress. Use small to moderate cross-sectional areas for nylon or steel. Lengths and areas chosen to balance mass and stress limits. Use member areas from catalog. Approximate stress by axial force = load projection divided by area. Assume uniformly distributed axial forces in members. Approximate mass as sum(length*area).",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Check member lengths and select areas to keep stress ≤ 20 and total mass ≤ 30.

Choose areas 1 to 3 depending on member stress. Calculate approximate forces by equilibrium, then stress = force/area ≤20.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Ensuring closed truss to transfer moments and shear from load at node_3 through node_4 to supports. Triangular shapes maximizes stiffness and minimize bending. Elevate node_4 to create rigid triangle. Use lower area on shorter members with expected tension, larger area for compression (higher expected force). Approximate forces from load components: vertical component ~ -7.07N, horizontal ~ -7.07N. Resolve node forces to find member axial forces to size area. Check mass limit by sum length × area index (where area values roughly proportional to cross section).",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_4 = √(0²+3.5²)=3.5, node_2-node_4=√((6-0)²+3.5²)=√(36+12.25)=√48.25=6.95, node_1-node_3=2, node_3-node_2=4, node_3-node_4=√((2-0)²+3.5²)=≈4.03. Sum length=3.5+6.95+2+4+4.03=20.48. Areas must be chosen for mass<=30, so average area ≤ 30/20.48=1.464. Assign smaller areas to longer members and/or members with less expected stress, larger area to highest stress members. Assume tensile stress mainly on node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, compressive on node_2-node_4, node_1-node_4. Use area ids 1 (0.195), 2 (0.782), 3 (1.759), 4(3.128), etc. Keep sum length*area ≤ 30.

Load components at node_3: Fx = -10*cos45= -7.07 N, Fy= -10*sin45= -7.07 N. Equilibrium at node_3: Axial forces f13, f32, f34 along members n1-n3, n3-n2, n3-n4, with angles 0°, 0°, and approx 60° to horizontal respectively. Solve simplified statics assuming f13 + f32 + f34 = resultant force at node_3. Estimate f34 carries vertical load mostly, assign area higher here (3=1.759). f13 and f32 carry horizontal load and minor vertical. Assign area 2=0.782 for f13 and f32. For longer compression members n1-n4 and n2-n4, assign area 4=3.128 for n2-n4 (longer, higher force), and area 3=1.759 for n1-n4. Mass = sum length*area: 3.5*1.759=6.16 + 6.95*3.128=21.75 + 2*0.782=1.564 + 4*0.782=3.128 + 4.03*1.759=7.09 total=6.16+21.75+1.56+3.13+7.09=39.7 exceeding 30. Need smaller areas for some.
