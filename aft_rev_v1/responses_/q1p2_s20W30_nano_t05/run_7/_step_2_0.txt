  "preamble": "Optimize node_5 position to reduce max stress and mass within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 7.57 < 20, total mass 28.08 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_5 is free to move. Member areas mostly moderate to large.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_4 (node_1-node_4) at 7.57, close to tensile limit but well within constraints. Mass is near limit. Node_5 connects multiple members with lower area indices (1,2,3). Adjusting node_5 position can redistribute forces and reduce stress peaks. Members connected to node_5 show moderate stresses. Current layout is a 5-node truss with a triangular upper portion and a horizontal base. Improving geometry to better triangulate and balance load paths can reduce stress.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on moving node_5 slightly upward and/or horizontally to improve force distribution. Avoid moving load/support nodes. Possibly reduce some member areas if stress allows. Aim to reduce max stress below 7.5 and mass below 28.",
  
  "reasoning": "Node_5 currently at (2.5,1.5) lies between node_3 (2,0) and node_4 (3,3). Moving node_5 closer to node_4 vertically may reduce bending in members connected to node_3 and node_5. Increasing vertical height can improve force transfer. Horizontal shift can balance forces between left and right sides. Adjust member areas after nodal move to reduce mass while keeping stress under limit. Members with low stress like member_8 (-1.23) and member_2 (-1.54) can have reduced area. Member_4 stress is critical; geometry change can reduce it.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Try node_5 at approx (2.6,1.8). This moves node_5 upward and slightly right. Check member lengths and expected stress distribution change. Reassign member_9 and member_10 area to 1 (0.195) to reduce mass. Keep member_4 area at 2 (0.782) or 3 (1.759) depending on stress. Other members keep current areas or reduce if stress low.",
  
  "calculation": "Node_5 move from (2.5,1.5) to (2.6,1.8):\n- member_7 (node_3-node_5) length increases slightly, stress may reduce due to better angle.\n- member_8 (node_4-node_5) length decreases slightly, stress may reduce.\n- member_9 and member_10 areas reduced to 1 (0.195) from 1 and 1.\n- member_4 area kept at 2 (0.782) to keep stress under control.\n- Other members unchanged.\nExpected mass reduction from smaller areas in members 9 and 10 offsets slight increase in member lengths. Max stress expected to reduce below 7.5.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes or members. Load and support nodes fixed. Areas chosen from given set. Node_5 moved precisely. Mass under 30, max stress under 20. Design remains closed 2D truss.",
