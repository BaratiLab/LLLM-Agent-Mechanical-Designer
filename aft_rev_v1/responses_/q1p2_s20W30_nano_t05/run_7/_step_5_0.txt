  "preamble": "Current truss meets constraints; stress minimized within limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max stress Â±20, max mass 30. Current max stress ~7.13, mass ~27.6, all within limits.",
  "analysis": "Load at node_3 induces max stress in member_4 (7.13). Members have appropriate areas. Node_5 position refined to reduce stresses. Mass is below limit, stress well below max allowable.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further node_5 adjustments yield diminishing returns on stress reduction. Load and support nodes fixed. Current design is stable and efficient.",
  "reasoning": "Stress is well below allowable limits, mass margin exists. Attempts to move node_5 further may increase stress elsewhere or mass. Member areas correspond well to stress demands. Structure is statically stable and closed. Optimization reached practical minimum stress.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member_4 stress reduced from ~7.57 (iter1) to ~7.13 (iter4). Node_5 moved gradually from (2.5,1.5) to (2.75,2.05). Mass steady ~27.6. No constraint violations.",
  "calculation": "No significant stress reduction possible by moving node_5 further without violating constraints or increasing mass. Current areas optimal per member stress levels.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Stop optimization; current design optimal within given constraints and instructions.",
