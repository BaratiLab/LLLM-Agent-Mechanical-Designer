Max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current max stress 47.6 exceeds limit, mass 13.07 is acceptable.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current design has excessive compressive stress in member_1 (-47.6 > -20). Members connected to node_3 carry large load, causing overstress. Member areas mostly small (area_id 1 to 3). Node_4 above base line creates triangle but stress distribution is uneven. Need to reduce stress in members connected to node_3 and redistribute load paths. Mass is within limit, so can increase areas selectively or add members/nodes to reduce stress.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Stress concentrated on member_1 suggests load path too direct and member too slender. Adding a node to create more load paths and better triangulation can help. Increase some member areas to reduce stress. Keep supports and load nodes fixed. Node_3 at (2,0) is too close to node_1 and node_2, limiting leverage. Consider moving node_4 to optimize geometry and add node_5 for better triangulation.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Add node_5 above node_3 to redistribute forces. Adjust node_4 position slightly upwards and right. Connect node_5 to node_1, node_2, and node_4. Remove member_3 (node_1-node_2) to reduce direct horizontal compression. Increase areas for members from load node and new node to supports. Use area_id 3 or 4 for critical members. Final structure: nodes - node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(3.0,3.0), node_5(2.5,1.5). Members - node_1-node_3(3), node_2-node_3(3), node_1-node_4(2), node_2-node_4(2), node_3-node_5(4), node_4-node_5(3), node_1-node_5(3), node_2-node_5(3).",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Adding node_5 creates additional load paths and reduces stress concentration on member_1. Removing direct member_3 reduces compressive load on that member. Increasing cross-sectional areas on members connected to load node and new node reduces stresses below limit.
