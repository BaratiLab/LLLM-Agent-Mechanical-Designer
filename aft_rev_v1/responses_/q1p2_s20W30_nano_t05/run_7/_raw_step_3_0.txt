Node_5 moved from (2.5,1.5) to (2.6,1.8) improved stress slightly.

Moving node_5 affects force distribution in members connected to node_3 and node_4. Node_3 and supports fixed, only node_5 can move. Aim to reduce tension at member_4 by adjusting node_5 to balance forces better and reduce stresses in members connected to node_4 and node_3.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_4 tension high, node_4 fixed at (3,3). Node_5 currently at (2.6,1.8). Moving node_5 slightly upward and right may reduce tension in member_4 by redistributing load. Avoid increasing length/mass too much. Area assignments seem adequate, no changes recommended now.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing node_5 y-coordinate redistributes load paths reducing tension at member_4 by sharing load with members 8 and 10. Slight right shift increases triangle stability. Small moves minimize mass increase. Member areas are balanced for current stress levels. No need to change member areas now. Node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Node_4 fixed. Only node_5 can be moved.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Try node_5 at (2.7, 2.0), slightly up and right from (2.6,1.8).

Member lengths updated: m9 (node_1-node_5) length increases slightly, m10 (node_2-node_5) length similar. Members 7 and 8 lengths slightly increase but better force distribution expected.
