  "preamble": "Optimize node_5 position to reduce max stress under constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 7.32 < 20, total mass 27.8 < 30, load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_5 moved from (2.5,1.5) to (2.6,1.8) improved stress slightly. Need further stress reduction by repositioning node_5.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress occurs at member_4 (node_1-node_4) tension 7.32. Members around node_5 have moderate stress. Moving node_5 affects force distribution in members connected to node_3 and node_4. Node_3 and supports fixed, only node_5 can move. Aim to reduce tension at member_4 by adjusting node_5 to balance forces better and reduce stresses in members connected to node_4 and node_3.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_4 tension high, node_4 fixed at (3,3). Node_5 currently at (2.6,1.8). Moving node_5 slightly upward and right may reduce tension in member_4 by redistributing load. Avoid increasing length/mass too much. Area assignments seem adequate, no changes recommended now.",
  
  "reasoning": "Increasing node_5 y-coordinate redistributes load paths reducing tension at member_4 by sharing load with members 8 and 10. Slight right shift increases triangle stability. Small moves minimize mass increase. Member areas are balanced for current stress levels. No need to change member areas now. Node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Node_4 fixed. Only node_5 can be moved.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Try node_5 at (2.7, 2.0), slightly up and right from (2.6,1.8). Estimate member lengths and stress distribution impact. Mass increase negligible. Expected max stress reduction due to better load sharing in top triangle. Verify no member stress exceeds Â±20.",
  
  "calculation": "Node_5 new position (2.7, 2.0). Member lengths updated: m9 (node_1-node_5) length increases slightly, m10 (node_2-node_5) length similar. Members 7 and 8 lengths slightly increase but better force distribution expected. Total mass estimated ~28.0 < 30. Max stress expected to reduce from 7.32 to ~6.8-7.0 range. No constraint violation expected.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_5 moved to (2.7, 2.0). Members unchanged. Areas unchanged. Load and supports unchanged. Mass and stress constraints satisfied. Further stress reduction possible but diminishing returns expected. Continue optimization for now.",
