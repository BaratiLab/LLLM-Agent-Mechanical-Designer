Need closed truss (all nodes connected forming at least one closed loop). Max stress ±20, max mass 30, areas discrete from given set. Node positions fixed for supports and load.",\n\n  "analysis": "With only 3 nodes, the minimal closed truss is a triangle connecting all nodes. Current nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0) are colinear on x-axis, so no closed triangle yet. To form a closed truss, add a 4th node above the line to form a triangle with node_1 and node_2. This will create a stable triangular truss with the load applied at node_3. The new node should be placed to minimize member length and stresses, while meeting constraints.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2.8, y) above the line; y to be optimized. Connect members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_2. This forms a closed loop with 4 nodes and 6 members. Calculate lengths and stresses assuming axial forces only. Use areas to keep stress ≤20 and total mass ≤30.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Place node_4 above node_3 near center to create a stiff triangle. Members connected to node_4 will carry load from node_3. Use simple static equilibrium to estimate member forces. Assume load at node_3 (-10, -45 deg) decomposed into Fx and Fy. Calculate member forces by method of joints. Use smallest area possible to keep stress under 20. Calculate mass as sum(length_i * area_i). Adjust node_4 y-coordinate to balance length and stress.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Load components at node_3: Fx = -10*cos(45°)= -7.07, Fy = -10*sin(45°) = -7.07.
