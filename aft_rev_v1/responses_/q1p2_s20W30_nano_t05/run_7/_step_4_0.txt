  "preamble": "Optimize stress by adjusting free node position to reduce max stress and maintain constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 7.175 < 20, total mass 27.65 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. Node_5 moved gradually upward and rightward from 1.5 to 2.0 in y, stress slightly decreased but still member_4 max stress high.",
  "analysis": "Max stress occurs in member_4 (node_1-node_4) at 7.175. This member is under tension and close to limit but can be reduced. Node_4 is fixed at (3.0,3.0), cannot move. Node_5 position affects stress distribution. Moving node_5 higher and slightly right reduces stress in member_4 and member_9. Members with smaller areas (1,2,3) carry significant stresses. To reduce max stress, better load path and force distribution is needed by repositioning node_5 to reduce tension in member_4 and compression in member_1.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try moving node_5 slightly closer to node_4 (higher y, closer x to 3.0) to improve force distribution. Keep node_3 at 2.0,0.0 fixed. Avoid increasing mass by not increasing large area members. Possibly reduce area of member_9 or 10 if stress allows, but currently areas seem well chosen.",
  "reasoning": "Since node_4 is fixed, optimize node_5 position to balance forces on members connected to it: members 7,8,9,10. Moving node_5 closer to node_4 reduces length of members 8 and 10, potentially reducing stress in these members and redistributing load away from member_4. Keep node_5 y-coordinate slightly above 2.0 to maintain geometry and avoid buckling. Small incremental moves to node_5 expected to reduce max stress below current 7.175. Areas are optimal for now; no changes to areas as mass is near limit.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_5 current (2.7, 2.0). Try (2.8, 2.1) or (2.75, 2.05). Check member lengths and estimated force distribution. Member_4 length fixed (node_1 to node_4). Member_9 length (node_1 to node_5) will increase slightly, but stress might reduce due to better force balance. Member_8 and 10 lengths reduce, reducing stress. Mass remains under 30.",
  "calculation": "Moving node_5 to (2.75, 2.05): member lengths approx: 1-5 ~2.75, 4-5 ~1.37, 2-5 ~3.35, 3-5 ~0.96. Slightly shorter member_8 and 10, better force path. Expect max stress reduction in member_4 from 7.175 to ~6.8-7.0. Total mass remains ~27.6. No area changes, all constraints met.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Confirm no load/support node moves, no duplicate members, areas unchanged. Node_5 moved slightly to improve stress distribution. Stop condition false as stress can still reduce slightly.",
