Current max stress ~6.74, mass ~28.82. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_5 newly added for better load distribution.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has max stress well below allowable ±20, mass close but under 30. Members with largest stress are member_6 (6.74) and member_7 (4.26). Node positions for load/support fixed except free nodes moved previously to reduce stress. Current topology is a closed truss with 5 nodes and 7 members, providing good load paths. Further reducing stress likely requires increasing member areas or changing topology which may increase mass beyond limit.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member areas mostly moderate to large (area_id 2 to 4), some members with small stress near zero. Node_5 positioned above node_3 to help distribute load. No violation in constraints. Mass close to max, so increasing areas risky. Moving free nodes further may not yield significant stress reduction.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Given max stress well below limit and mass near limit, further optimization by changing node positions or areas unlikely to improve stress significantly without increasing mass. Current design is balanced with load path efficiently distributed. Member areas chosen to handle forces with safety margin. Node_5 placement provides effective triangulation. Stopping now is optimal.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Max stress 6.74 << 20; mass 28.82 < 30. No constraints violated. Load at node_3 (-10, -45°) well supported by node_1 pinned and node_2 roller. Members connect nodes efficiently. No redundant members or nodes. Node_3 and load/support nodes fixed as per instruction.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Stress and mass within limits. No member stress exceeds ±20. Total mass 28.82 under 30. Member areas chosen from allowed set. Node_5 coordinates (2.0, 4.0) provide good load distribution.
