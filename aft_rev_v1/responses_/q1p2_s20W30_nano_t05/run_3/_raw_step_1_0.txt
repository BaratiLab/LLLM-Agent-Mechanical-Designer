Current max stress 30.96 > 20, mass 8.19 < 30. Load at node_3 (-10, -45°). Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Nodes fixed at node_1, node_2, node_3; node_4 can be moved or replaced.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design fails due to member_4 stress (30.96) and member_5 (22.81) exceeding ±20. Member_4 and member_5 are bottom chord diagonal members (node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2). The top node_4 is at (2.0, 2.5), possibly causing high stress in these members. Members connected to node_3 have acceptable stress. Mass is well below max, so increasing cross-sectional area in critical members or repositioning node_4 to reduce stress is possible. Adding an intermediate node to redistribute forces or changing topology is also an option.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Options: 1) Move node_4 higher or reposition to reduce stress in members 4 and 5. 2) Add a new node to create a more triangular load path. 3) Change member areas to reduce stress. 4) Remove redundant members if any. Aim to keep nodes fixed at supports and load, add one node if needed.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add one new node (node_5) above node_3 to form a triangle with node_4 and node_3, reposition node_4 slightly right and higher to reduce stress concentration. Use larger areas for diagonal members carrying high stress and smaller for others. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_4. Areas selected to keep stresses within ±20 and total mass < 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "By adding node_5 at (2.0, 3.5), forces can be better distributed in the upper chord and diagonals. Moving node_4 to (3.0, 2.8) reduces length and stress in members 4 and 5. Using area 3 (1.759) for main diagonals and 2 (0.782) for chords balances mass and strength. This layout forms stable triangles and reduces stress concentration.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and assign areas: member_1 (node_1-node_3): length 2.0, area 2 (0.782); member_2 (node_3-node_2): length 4.0, area 2 (0.782); member_3 (node_3-node_5): length 1.5, area 3 (1.759); member_4 (node_5-node_4): length ~1.118, area 3 (1.759); member_5 (node_4-node_2): length ~3.201, area 2 (0.782); member_6 (node_1-node_4): length ~3.354, area 2 (0.782).
