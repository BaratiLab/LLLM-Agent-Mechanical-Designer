Current max stress 32.9 > 20, mass 12.25 < 30. Load at node_3 (-10N, -45°). Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Existing nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2.7,2.5), node_5(2,3). Members mostly with area 2 or less, max stress on member_3 (-32.9).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress violation mainly in member_3 (node_3-node_5) with area 1 (0.195). Member_3 is under high compression. Member_4 (node_5-node_4) has area 0 (1) but low stress. The structure is asymmetric and has a node_5 close above node_3 causing stress concentration. Load at node_3 is diagonal downward left, so truss should better transfer load to supports with triangulation. Current design lacks a direct diagonal member from node_3 to node_4 or node_2 to node_5, which could help redistribute forces. Also, member_3 area is too small for the load. Mass is well below limit, so increasing area or adding members is possible. Node_5 position can be adjusted upward and right to reduce compression in member_3. Adding a diagonal member from node_3 to node_4 can help. Using larger area for critical members can reduce stress.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increase area of member_3 from 1 to 3 or 4 to reduce stress. Add member from node_3 to node_4. Move node_5 slightly right and up to reduce compression in member_3. Possibly add member from node_5 to node_2 for better load path. Keep node_1 and node_2 fixed. Check mass after area increase and added member.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Modify existing nodes: move node_5 from (2.0,3.0) to (2.5,3.2). Add member_7: node_3 to node_4 with area 3.

Adding diagonal member_7 (node_3-node_4) improves triangulation and load path, reducing stress in member_3. Moving node_5 slightly right and up reduces compression in member_3 by changing geometry. Increasing member_5 area supports better load transfer to node_2. Mass increase still below 30.
