Load at node_3, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_4 and node_5 movable.",\n  "analysis": "Max stress mainly in member_1 (-15.55) and member_6 (8.87). Member_3 zero stress suggests possible area or position inefficiency. Member areas vary from 0 to 3. Node_5 moved up and right, node_4 positioned to balance load paths. Adding member_7 improved stiffness and reduced max stress vs prior iterations.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing stress in member_1 and member_6 by adjusting node_4 and node_5 positions to improve force distribution. Possibly reduce area in low stress members or redistribute forces by geometry changes.",\n  "reasoning": "Member_1 under compression near max allowed; moving node_4 slightly may reduce compression. Member_6 tension can be reduced by adjusting node_4 closer to node_1 or changing angle. Member_3 with zero stress but large area (3) can have area reduced to save mass or node_5 moved closer to node_3 to balance forces. Member_7 area 3 is moderate and stress low, keep or reduce area to save mass. Total mass close to limit; reducing member_3 area beneficial.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas: member_3 length ~ distance(node_3-node_5), currently area 3 (1.759). Reducing area to 2 (0.782) saves mass ~5.7 to ~2.5, good tradeoff if stress allows. Adjust node_5 y from 3.2 to ~2.9 to reduce lever arm and stress. Move node_4 slightly left and down from (2.7,2.5) to (2.5,2.3) to reduce member_1 compression and member_6 tension. Check if member_7 can reduce area from 3 to 2 to save mass. Mass savings can allow increasing areas in critical members if needed.",\n  "calculation": "New node_4 (2.5, 2.3), node_5 (2.5, 2.9). Member_3 area from 3 to 2. Member_7 area from 3 to 2. Member_5 keep area 3 as stress low. Member_1 and member_6 keep area 2. Member_2 area 2. Member_4 area 0 (1). Estimated mass reduction ~5, total mass ~20.8 < 30. Expected stress on member_1 reduced due to shorter lever arm, member_6 tension reduced. Member_3 stress may increase slightly but area reduced, acceptable. Member_7 stress low, area reduction saves mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Positions and member areas adjusted to reduce max stress and mass. Constraints met, stress max < 20, mass < 30.
