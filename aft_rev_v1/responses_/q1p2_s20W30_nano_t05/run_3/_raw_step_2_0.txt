Load at node_3, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Node_3 and supports fixed; can move node_4 and node_5 only.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has low max stress but relatively high mass due to large area (3) on member_3 and members with area 2. Member_3 has zero stress, indicating possible over-sizing. Members near node_4 and node_5 have low stress, suggesting potential to reduce area or reposition nodes to redistribute forces more efficiently.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_3 area can be reduced; reposition node_5 slightly to improve force distribution. Node_4 can be moved slightly to balance forces. Consider reducing area of members with low stress. Maintain closed truss shape to ensure structural stability and support load path.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Reducing area on zero or low stress members reduces mass without increasing stress beyond limits. Slight repositioning of node_4 and node_5 can optimize geometry to reduce stress concentration on member_5 (max compressive stress). Maintaining node_3 and supports fixed preserves load and boundary conditions. Use area 1 or 0.782 for low stress members to reduce mass. Keep members with higher stress at area 2 to ensure strength.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member_3 area from 3 to 1 (mass factor 1.759), member_4 from 3 to 2 (0.782), member_5 and member_6 keep area 2 (0.782). Move node_5 from (2.0,3.5) to (2.0,3.0) to reduce lever arm and stress on member_5. Move node_4 from (3.0,2.8) slightly left and down to (2.7,2.5) to balance forces and reduce stress on member_5 and member_6.",\n  \n  "calculation": "New member areas: member_3 = 1, member_4 = 2, others unchanged except member_1 and member_2 at area 2. New node positions: node_4 = (2.7, 2.5), node_5 = (2.0, 3.0). Estimated mass reduction from area reductions ~4-5 units, total mass ~15-16. Max stress expected to remain below 6 given geometry improvement and area adjustments.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Check no duplicated nodes or members. All nodes except node_3, node_1, node_2 moved within allowed limits. Areas selected from allowed set. Closed truss maintained with 6 members.
