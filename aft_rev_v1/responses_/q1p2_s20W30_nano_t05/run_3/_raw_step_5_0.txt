Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 and 5 moved to reduce stress. Member areas mostly 2 or 3.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_1 (-15.59), compressive near limit but acceptable. Mass well below max. Members with low stress (3,4) have small areas (0,2). Member_7 stress -9.25 is moderate. Node_4 and 5 positions can be adjusted to better balance load paths and reduce stress in member_1 and member_6.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 high compressive stress suggests load path concentration. Possibly shifting node_4 slightly right and up to reduce bending. Member_6 area 2 (0.782) but relatively high stress 8.9, consider increasing area to 3 (1.759) or 4 (3.128) to reduce stress. Member_7 area 2, stress -9.25, could increase area to 3 for safety. Member_5 area 3 with low stress 2.44, could reduce area to 2 to save mass. Node_5 lowered slightly to reduce length of member_3 and member_4 which have negligible stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "To reduce max stress, increase cross-section area of highly stressed members (member_1, member_6, member_7). To keep mass in limit, reduce area of low stress members (member_5). Adjust node_4 position to optimize force distribution and reduce stress on member_1 and member_6. Maintain load and support node positions. Node_3 fixed. Node_4 and 5 can move within small range to optimize geometry.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member areas: member_1: increase area from 2 to 3 or 4, member_6: increase from 2 to 3, member_7: increase from 2 to 3, member_5: reduce from 3 to 2. Node_4 move from (2.5,2.3) to (2.7,2.5) to reduce bending and improve force path. Node_5 move from (2.5,2.9) to (2.5,2.7) to shorten low stress members and reduce mass.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Estimate mass changes: member_1 length ~2.0, area 3 (1.759), mass ~3.518 vs current 1.564*2=3.128 (area 2).

Net mass reduced by ~3.8. Total mass ~19.46 - 5.8 + 7.7 = ~21.3 < 30. Stress expected to reduce due to increased area and better node placement.
