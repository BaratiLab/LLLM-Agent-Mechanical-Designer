Current max stress ~6.9, mass ~23.35, both within constraints.",\n  "analysis": "Current structure has well-distributed stresses, no member exceeds ±7 max stress, mass is below limit. Load and support nodes fixed; movable nodes optimized for geometry and cross-section areas.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Members with highest stress have relatively large areas (3 or 2) balancing stress and mass. Minor stress in some members indicates efficient load path. Geometry forms a stable closed truss.",\n  "reasoning": "Further reducing stress would require increasing member areas or altering node positions. Increasing area risks exceeding mass limit. Moving nodes closer to load/support nodes risks increasing stress or instability.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Max stress reduced from ~15 in prior iterations to ~6.9 now, mass increased but still under 30. Areas chosen from available set balancing mass and strength. Node positions refined to optimize load transfer.",\n  "calculation": "Total mass = 23.35 < 30; max stress = 6.91 < 20.
