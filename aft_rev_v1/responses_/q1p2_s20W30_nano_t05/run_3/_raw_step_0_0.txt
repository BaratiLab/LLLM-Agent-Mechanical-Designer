Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) provide boundary conditions. To form a closed truss, add at least one more node above to form a triangle or quadrilateral. Triangles are optimal for stability and minimal members. Adding node_4 above node_3 will create two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_3, node_2, node_4). This provides load path and stiffness. Node_4 position should be optimized to balance member lengths and stresses. Member areas selected from given discrete set to keep stress ≤ 20 and total mass ≤ 30. Mass approximated as sum of (length × area). Stress approximated from axial forces due to load and support reactions using static equilibrium and truss assumptions (axial forces only).",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2,2.5) approx.
