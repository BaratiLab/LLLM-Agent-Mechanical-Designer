    "preamble": "Optimize a closed 2D truss with 3 given nodes under load, minimizing stress and mass within constraints.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes: node_1(0,0, pinned), node_2(6,0, roller), node_3(2,0, load -10 at -45°). Need closed truss with all nodes connected. Max stress ±20, max mass 30. Areas discrete from 0 to 10. First iteration, no prior data.",

    "analysis": "The truss must be closed and connected with nodes fixed at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0). Load at node_3 downward-left. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) provide boundary conditions. To form a closed truss, add at least one more node above to form a triangle or quadrilateral. Triangles are optimal for stability and minimal members. Adding node_4 above node_3 will create two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_3, node_2, node_4). This provides load path and stiffness. Node_4 position should be optimized to balance member lengths and stresses. Member areas selected from given discrete set to keep stress ≤ 20 and total mass ≤ 30. Mass approximated as sum of (length × area). Stress approximated from axial forces due to load and support reactions using static equilibrium and truss assumptions (axial forces only).",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2,2.5) approx. Members: (1-3), (3-2), (1-4), (4-2), (3-4). Calculate member lengths, estimate forces by equilibrium, select minimal areas to keep stress ≤20, sum mass to check ≤30.",

    "reasoning": "1) Node_4 placed above node_3 to form two triangles for stability. 2) Members connect all nodes: 1-3, 3-2, 1-4, 4-2, 3-4. 3) Load at node_3 creates tension/compression in members. 4) Use static equilibrium at nodes to estimate member forces. 5) Calculate member lengths by Euclidean distance. 6) Calculate axial forces, then stress = force/area. 7) Choose area from given discrete set to keep |stress| ≤ 20. 8) Sum mass = Σ(length × area) ≤ 30. 9) Adjust node_4 height to balance forces and mass.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members only carry axial forces, pin joints, static equilibrium, no bending. Load vector at node_3: magnitude 10, direction -45°, components Fx = -10*cos(45°) = -7.07, Fy = -10*sin(45°) = -7.07. Support reactions at node_1 and node_2. Member length formula: L = sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2). Stress = Force / Area. Force from equilibrium equations. Use smallest area satisfying stress constraints to minimize mass.",
