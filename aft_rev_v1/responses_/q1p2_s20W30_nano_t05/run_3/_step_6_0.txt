  "preamble": "Optimization at iteration 5 achieves low max stress within mass and stress limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: minimize max stress <= ±20 and total mass <= 30. Current max stress ~6.9, mass ~23.35, both within constraints.",
  "analysis": "Current structure has well-distributed stresses, no member exceeds ±7 max stress, mass is below limit. Load and support nodes fixed; movable nodes optimized for geometry and cross-section areas.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Members with highest stress have relatively large areas (3 or 2) balancing stress and mass. Minor stress in some members indicates efficient load path. Geometry forms a stable closed truss.",
  "reasoning": "Further reducing stress would require increasing member areas or altering node positions. Increasing area risks exceeding mass limit. Moving nodes closer to load/support nodes risks increasing stress or instability.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Max stress reduced from ~15 in prior iterations to ~6.9 now, mass increased but still under 30. Areas chosen from available set balancing mass and strength. Node positions refined to optimize load transfer.",
  "calculation": "Total mass = 23.35 < 30; max stress = 6.91 < 20. Stress distribution balanced, no member near limits. Geometry stable and closed. Further node movement or area adjustment unlikely to yield significant improvement without violating constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints satisfied, objective met with good margin. No duplicated nodes or members. Load/support nodes fixed. Structure is optimal given inputs and constraints.",
