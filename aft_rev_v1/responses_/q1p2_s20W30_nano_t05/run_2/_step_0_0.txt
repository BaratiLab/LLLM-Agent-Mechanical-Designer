  "preamble": "Optimize a closed 2D truss with given nodes, load, supports, minimizing stress and mass under constraints.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes: node_1(0,0, pinned), node_2(6,0, roller), node_3(2,0, load -10N at -45°). Objective: closed truss (all nodes connected forming at least one cycle). Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass ≤30. Areas discrete from 0 to 10. First iteration, no node position changes for given nodes.",
  
  "analysis": "Given nodes are colinear on x-axis. To form a closed truss, need at least one additional node off this line to form a triangle or polygon. The load at node_3 is downward-left diagonal (-10N at -45°). Supports at node_1 pinned (restrains both directions), node_2 roller (restrains vertical). To resist load and minimize stress, a triangular truss is ideal with node_4 placed above node_3 to form a triangle. This adds members node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4. The triangle shares base node_1-node_2. This closed triangle will distribute load, reduce stress. Use area selection to balance stress and mass. Approximate member lengths and forces using static equilibrium assumptions and truss method. Use smallest areas possible while keeping stress ≤20.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2.0, y4), y4>0 to form triangle with node_1 and node_2. Members: (1-3), (3-4), (4-1), (4-2), (1-2). Check if node_3-node_1 and node_3-node_4 sufficient. Possibly drop node_3-node_2 to reduce mass. Approximate length and forces. Use simple truss formulas and equilibrium.",
  
  "reasoning": "1) Node_3 is load point, so connect it to node_1 and node_4 for load transfer. 2) Node_4 placed vertically above node_3 at y4=3.0 (half base length) to form near equilateral triangle with base node_1-node_2. 3) Members: (1-2), (1-3), (3-4), (4-2) form closed quadrilateral with diagonal (1-4). 4) Member lengths: (1-2)=6.0, (1-3)=2.0, (3-4)=3.0, (4-2)=4.472 (distance sqrt((6-2)^2+ (0-3)^2)), (1-4)=3.162. 5) Assign areas starting from smallest to keep mass low. Increase area where stress exceeds limits. 6) Use force equilibrium at nodes and member force method to estimate member axial forces and then stress = force/area. 7) Mass = sum(length * area). Keep ≤30. 8) Choose area ids from given discrete set.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic, axial forces only, neglect self-weight, static equilibrium. Calculate member forces by joint method or method of sections. Use stress = force/area ≤20. Start areas at 1 (area_id=0) and increase where needed. Approximate forces by resolving load at node_3 among connected members. Calculate mass = Σ(length * area).",
  
  "calculation": "Node_4 at (2.0, 3.0). Members and lengths: (1-2)=6.0, (1-3)=2.0, (3-4)=3.0, (4-2)=4.472, (1-4)=3.162. Load at node_3: 10N at -45°, components Fx=-7.07N, Fy=-7.07N. Equilibrium at node_3: members (1-3) and (3-4) share load. Approximate force in (1-3) along x-axis: ~7N tension, in (3-4) along y-axis: ~7N compression. Stress = force/area. For area_id=1 (0.195), stress = 7/0.195=35.9 >20 (too high). Increase area to area_id=3 (1.759), stress=7/1.759=3.98 <20 safe. For (1-3) area_id=3. Similarly for (3-4) area_id=3. Other members carry less load, assign area_id=1 (0.195). Mass = sum(length*area): (1-2):6*0.195=1.17, (1-3):2*1.759=3.518, (3-4):3*1.759=5.277, (4-2):4.472*0.195=0.872, (1-4):3.162*0.195=0.617. Total mass=1.17+3.518+5.277+0.872+0.617=11.454 <30 OK. Max stress ~3.98 <20 OK. Closed structure with 4 nodes and 5 members. All nodes connected.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 added at (2.0, 3.0). 5 members forming closed polygon. Areas chosen to keep stress <20 and mass <30. Load resolved approximately. Supports fixed as given. No node position changed for existing nodes. Structure is statically determinate and closed. Ready to output.",
