Current max stress ~7.34 and mass ~25.95, both within constraints.",\n  "analysis": "Max stress is well below ±20 limit, mass is below 30. Load and support nodes fixed. Member areas and node positions are well balanced. Minor stresses in members; no critical overstress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further node movement risks increasing stress or mass. Current design uses efficient member areas and node placement.",\n  "reasoning": "Given max stress is low and mass near but below limit, further optimization may yield marginal gains but risk constraint violation. Node_3 and Node_4 fixed as load/support neighbors. Current closed truss with 8 nodes and 11 members is stable and efficient.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress distribution is balanced; no member close to ±20 limit. Member areas mostly mid-range (1 to 3) which balances mass and strength. No redundant members or nodes.",\n  "calculation": "No member exceeds stress limits. Total mass 25.95 < 30. Member stresses range ±7.34. Node positions fixed for load/support; internal nodes well placed. No need to change member areas or node locations.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met.
