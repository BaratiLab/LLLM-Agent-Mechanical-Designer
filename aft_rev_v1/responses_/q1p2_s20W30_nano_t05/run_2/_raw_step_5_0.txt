Constraints: max stress ±20, total mass ≤30. Existing design exceeds stress limit on member_7 and mass is moderate.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current design has max stress 28.5 on member_7 (node_1-node_4) exceeding ±20 limit. Mass 17.54 < 30 is acceptable. Members with highest stress are on diagonal members connected to node_4. The structure has 6 nodes including two added nodes (node_5, node_6) near the load. The load is at node_3 on bottom chord. The top chord and diagonal members carry stress. The member_7 (node_1-node_4) with area_id=1 (0.195 area) is overstressed, indicating either insufficient area or geometry causing high load concentration. The bottom chord members have moderate stress. The structure is somewhat complex with 8 members. Reducing stress requires better force distribution and possibly increasing area in critical members or altering topology.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Options: increase cross-section area of overstressed member or add members to redistribute load. Avoid increasing mass excessively. Consider adding a node between node_1 and node_4 to create a shorter diagonal, reducing stress. Also, reconsider member areas to optimize mass and stress. Possibly remove member_8 (node_5-node_2) which is low stressed but adds mass. Use areas from given set to meet constraints.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add an intermediate node between node_1 and node_4 to split long diagonal member_7 into two shorter members with moderate area. Remove member_8 to reduce mass. Adjust member areas: increase area of critical diagonals to area_id=3 (1.759) or 4 (3.128) as needed. Keep bottom chord members with moderate area. Connect node_3 to new node for better load path. New node placed at (1.0, 1.5). Members: node_1-node_7, node_7-node_4, node_3-node_7, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_6, node_6-node_2, node_4-node_6, node_1-node_3, node_5-node_2. Remove member_8.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Splitting long diagonal reduces bending and axial stress by shortening member length and increasing redundancy. Adding node_7 at (1.0,1.5) creates two diagonals sharing load. Removing low stressed member_8 reduces mass. Increasing area on critical members reduces stress below limit. Bottom chord members remain to transfer load to supports. This topology balances mass and stress constraints.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas estimated: node_1-node_7 ~1.802, node_7-node_4 ~1.802, node_3-node_7 ~1.802, node_3-node_5 ~2.06, node_5-node_6 ~1.04, node_6-node_2 ~1.8, node_4-node_6 ~2.06, node_1-node_3=2.0, node_5-node_2 ~2.06.
