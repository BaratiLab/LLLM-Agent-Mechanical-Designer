Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current max stress 29.05 too high, mass 11.64 under limit. Need to reduce stress especially in member_5 and member_4.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high stress in member_5 (29.05) and member_4 (20.15). Member_5 connects node_1 to node_4, which is a diagonal member under high tension/compression. Member_4 connects node_4 to node_2, also diagonal. The horizontal member_1 is low stress (-16.1). The vertical member_3 and member_2 have low stresses. The large area in members_2 and 3 (area 3) adds mass but low stress. Possibly redistributing areas and adding a node to improve force flow is beneficial.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding one intermediate node between node_3 and node_4 to split load path and reduce stress in diagonals. Adjust member areas to reduce oversized members. Possibly reduce area of member_5 and member_4 from 1 to 0.782 or 0.195. Ensure no node moves at supports or load nodes.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (3.5, 1.5) to create a more triangular load path. Remove member_5 (node_1-node_4) to reduce high stress diagonal. Connect node_3 to node_5, node_5 to node_4, and node_5 to node_2. Use areas to keep stresses under 20 and mass under 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 splits load path from node_3 to node_4 and node_2, reducing stress concentration on member_5. Removing member_5 eliminates the highest stressed member. The new triangular substructure distributes forces better. Area selection based on length and stress: longer members get smaller area if stress low, shorter members higher area if stress high. Areas selected from given discrete set.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3 ~2.0, node_3-node_5 ~1.8028, node_5-node_4 ~1.8028, node_5-node_2 ~2.6926, node_1-node_2 =6.0, node_4-node_2 ~3.3541, node_3-node_4 ~3.0 removed.
