  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to satisfy stress and mass constraints under given loads and supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 (-10, -45°), supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current max stress 25.25 exceeds limit. Mass 22.7 is within limit. Need to reduce max stress by redesign or adjusting areas and topology.",
  
  "analysis": "Current structure has a critical stress on member_3 (node_4-node_7) at 25.25, exceeding ±20 limit. Mass is acceptable. Members with zero stress indicate possible inefficiency. The truss is somewhat complex with 7 nodes and 9 members. Load at node_3 induces high stress in members connected to node_4 and node_7. The load is downward-left at 45°, so members near node_3 to upper nodes must resist tension/compression effectively. The current layout has some long members with large cross sections (area_id 4 on member_1).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress, consider better load path distribution: add a node between node_3 and node_4 or node_7 to reduce member length and stress. Possibly increase area on critical members or add redundant members to share load. Avoid increasing mass beyond 30. Keep supports and load nodes fixed. Remove members with zero stress if possible to reduce mass. Use areas from given discrete set.",
  
  "proposal": "Add one intermediate node between node_4 and node_7 to reduce stress on member_3. Adjust members to create triangular substructures for better load distribution. Increase area of critical members slightly but within mass budget. Remove or reduce area of low-stress members. Proposed nodes: keep existing nodes fixed, add node_8 at (2.5, 2.0). Members: connect node_4-node_8, node_8-node_7, node_3-node_8. Adjust areas: critical members area_id 3 or 4, others area_id 1 or 2.",
  
  "reasoning": "Adding node_8 between node_4 and node_7 splits a long member into two shorter members, reducing stress. Connecting node_3 to node_8 provides alternative load path. Triangular geometry improves stability and stress distribution. Increasing areas on critical members reduces stress but increases mass; balance is required. Removing zero stress members or reducing their area saves mass. The load at node_3 is supported by node_1 pinned and node_2 roller, so members from node_3 to upper nodes and supports must be optimized.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Estimate member lengths: node_4(2,3) to node_7(3,2.5) ≈ 1.118. Adding node_8 at (2.5,2) divides into approx. 0.707 segments. Member lengths: node_3(2,0) to node_8(2.5,2) ≈ 2.06, node_8 to node_7 ≈ 0.71, node_4 to node_8 ≈ 1.12. Assign area 3 (1.759) or 4 (3.128) to critical members. Calculate approximate mass and check sum < 30. Check max stress by distributing load over more members.",

Areas adjusted to keep mass reasonable.",

Mass within limit. Max stress expected below 20 by load redistribution and shorter members. Ready to output final design.",
