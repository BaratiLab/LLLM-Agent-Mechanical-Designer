Current mass 36.27 > 30, max stress 3.91 < 20. Need to reduce mass mainly.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure meets stress limits but exceeds mass limit by ~6.27 units. Members have large cross-sectional areas (area_id 3 and 4 mostly). Load at node_3 downward-left. Supports at node_1 pinned (full restraint) and node_2 roller (vertical restraint). Nodes fixed for load/support; can add or move others. Current design has 5 nodes, 6 members. Strategy: reduce member areas and possibly shorten members or remove redundant members to reduce mass while keeping stress within limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing areas on low stressed members is first step. Possibly remove member_6 (node_3-node_6) or reduce area because its stress is low (-3.06). Also member_2 (node_3-node_4) has low stress (-1.17). Keep key load path members with sufficient area. Possibly add a node between node_3 and node_6 to reduce member length or redistribute forces. Also consider reducing member_1 area from 4 to 3 or 2. Focus on minimal effective truss with shorter members and smaller areas.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2,3). Add node_5 at (4,1.5) to split longer members. Members: node_1-node_3 (area 2), node_3-node_4 (area 2), node_4-node_5 (area 2), node_5-node_2 (area 2), node_3-node_5 (area 1), node_1-node_4 (area 1). Remove node_6 and members connected to it. This reduces member lengths and areas, reduces mass while maintaining load path.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Reducing member areas from 3-4 to 1-2 reduces mass significantly. Adding node_5 splits longer members into shorter ones, reducing stress concentration and member length. Removing node_6 and its members removes heavy members with moderate stress but high mass. Member areas selected based on stress magnitude and load path importance. Smaller area for diagonal members with less stress. This layout maintains load transfer from node_3 load to supports node_1 and node_2 with minimal mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas calculated for mass: length * area. Areas chosen from given discrete set. Check max stress after modification: expect max stress < 20 due to reduced areas and shorter lengths. Total mass expected < 30. Supports and load nodes fixed, no move. No duplicate members.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2m, node_3-node_4 = 3m, node_4-node_5 = sqrt((4-2)^2+(1.5-3)^2)=2.5m approx, node_5-node_2 = sqrt((6-4)^2+(0-1.5)^2)=2.5m approx, node_3-node_5 = sqrt((4-2)^2+(1.5-0)^2)=2.5m approx, node_1-node_4 = 3m. Mass = sum(length*area). Using areas: 2,2,2,2,1,1 => mass = 2*2 + 3*2 + 2.5*2 + 2.5*2 + 2.5*1 + 3*1 = 4 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 2.5 + 3 = 25.5 < 30.
