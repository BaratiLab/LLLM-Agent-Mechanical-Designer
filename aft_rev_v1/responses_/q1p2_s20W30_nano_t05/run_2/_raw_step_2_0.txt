Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current design fails stress (max 537) though mass is low (7.6).",\n\n  "analysis": "Current structure has excessive stresses on members 5 and 6 near node_2 and node_4, indicating poor load path and member sizing. Member areas are small leading to high stresses. Node_5 addition did not reduce stresses adequately. Load at node_3 needs better load transfer to supports node_1 and node_2. Current design has redundant members or inefficient geometry causing stress concentration.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, add diagonal members forming stable triangles from load node to supports. Increase member areas on critical load paths. Keep node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_3 is load node, so keep it fixed but consider adding a new node higher up to create a truss with better force distribution. Avoid long slender members under tension/compression.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add node_6 at (4.0, 3.5) to create an upper chord. Connect node_3 to node_6, node_4 to node_6, and node_6 to node_2. Remove node_5 to simplify. Use areas 3 or 4 on main members to reduce stress. Use smaller areas on less stressed members. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_6, node_6-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_3-node_6. This creates a truss with triangular panels distributing forces and reducing max stress.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Triangular truss geometry distributes load efficiently. Adding node_6 at higher elevation creates better load path from node_3 to supports. Removing node_5 removes stress concentration. Increasing areas on main load carrying members reduces stress below limit. Keeping total mass below 30 is easy with moderate areas. Using member areas 3 (1.759) and 4 (3.128) balances mass and strength.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2m, node_3-node_4 = 3m, node_4-node_6 ≈ 1.118m, node_6-node_2 ≈ 2.236m, node_1-node_4 ≈ 3.605m, node_3-node_6 ≈ 3.162m. Assign areas: node_1-node_3: 4, node_3-node_4: 4, node_4-node_6: 3, node_6-node_2: 3, node_1-node_4: 2, node_3-node_6: 3. Calculate mass sum: ≈ (2*3.128)+(3*3.128)+(1.118*1.759)+(2.236*1.759)+(3.605*0.782)+(3.162*1.759) ≈ 6.256+9.384+1.966+3.933+2.819+5.561 = 29.92 < 30.
