Current max stress 59.0 too high, mass 17.5 acceptable. Load at node_3 downward-left, supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Nodes 1,2,3 fixed; others modifiable. Member areas from 0 to 10. Need to reduce stress on member_8 (-59) and member_9 (-27.7).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has excessive compressive stress on member_8 (node_1-node_3) and member_9 (node_5-node_2). Member_8 area is small (area_id=1=0.195), too small for load. Several members have moderate stress but within limits. The structure has redundant members with possibly inefficient load paths. Node_7 addition didn\'t reduce max stress. The load at node_3 (-10 at -45°) induces tension/compression in members connected to node_3. To reduce stress, need better load path and larger cross-section in critical members or redistribute forces by adding nodes and members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding a new node above node_3 to create a triangular load path. Increase area on critical members. Remove less effective members to reduce mass. Use area 3 or 4 for high-stress members. Keep node_1 and node_2 fixed as supports. Possibly remove node_7 or reposition it for better force distribution. Use members forming triangles for stability.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Propose 7 nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (2,3), node_5 (4.2,1.8), node_6 (4.5,2.5), add node_7 (3.0,2.5) to improve load path. Members: node_1-node_3 (area 4), node_3-node_4 (area 3), node_4-node_7 (area 2), node_7-node_6 (area 2), node_6-node_2 (area 3), node_5-node_6 (area 2), node_3-node_5 (area 2), node_1-node_4 (area 1), node_5-node_2 (area 1). Remove member_8 from current design and replace with node_7 connections to reduce stress concentration. Increase area on node_1-node_3 to area 4 to reduce stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing area on critical members reduces stress by increasing load capacity. Adding node_7 near load spreads forces, reducing peak stress on node_1-node_3. Triangular members improve stiffness and distribute load. Removing direct node_1-node_3 small area member reduces stress concentration. Using moderate areas on other members balances mass and strength. Node positions chosen to maintain geometry and improve force flow.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths, then mass = sum(length*area). Check max stress estimated by force paths and cross-sectional area. Member areas chosen to keep stress < 20. Load vector decomposed into x,y components (-10*cos45°, -10*sin45°) ~ (-7.07, -7.07).
