  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under given load with stress and mass constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 with magnitude 10 at -45°, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current max stress 29.05 too high, mass 11.64 under limit. Need to reduce stress especially in member_5 and member_4.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design has high stress in member_5 (29.05) and member_4 (20.15). Member_5 connects node_1 to node_4, which is a diagonal member under high tension/compression. Member_4 connects node_4 to node_2, also diagonal. The horizontal member_1 is low stress (-16.1). The vertical member_3 and member_2 have low stresses. The large area in members_2 and 3 (area 3) adds mass but low stress. Possibly redistributing areas and adding a node to improve force flow is beneficial.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding one intermediate node between node_3 and node_4 to split load path and reduce stress in diagonals. Adjust member areas to reduce oversized members. Possibly reduce area of member_5 and member_4 from 1 to 0.782 or 0.195. Ensure no node moves at supports or load nodes.",
  
  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (3.5, 1.5) to create a more triangular load path. Remove member_5 (node_1-node_4) to reduce high stress diagonal. Connect node_3 to node_5, node_5 to node_4, and node_5 to node_2. Use areas to keep stresses under 20 and mass under 30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 splits load path from node_3 to node_4 and node_2, reducing stress concentration on member_5. Removing member_5 eliminates the highest stressed member. The new triangular substructure distributes forces better. Area selection based on length and stress: longer members get smaller area if stress low, shorter members higher area if stress high. Areas selected from given discrete set.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3 ~2.0, node_3-node_5 ~1.8028, node_5-node_4 ~1.8028, node_5-node_2 ~2.6926, node_1-node_2 =6.0, node_4-node_2 ~3.3541, node_3-node_4 ~3.0 removed. Areas chosen to keep stress <20, mass sum <30.",
  
  "calculation": "Lengths: node_1-node_3=2.0, node_3-node_5=√((3.5-2)^2+(1.5-0)^2)=√(2.25+2.25)=√4.5=2.1213, node_5-node_4=√((3.5-2)^2+(1.5-3)^2)=√(2.25+2.25)=2.1213, node_5-node_2=√((6-3.5)^2+(0-1.5)^2)=√(6.25+2.25)=√8.5=2.9155, node_1-node_2=6.0, node_4-node_2=√((6-2)^2+(0-3)^2)=√(16+9)=5.0. Assign areas: member_1(node_1-node_2): area 1 (0.195), member_2(node_1-node_3): area 2 (0.782), member_3(node_3-node_5): area 2 (0.782), member_4(node_5-node_4): area 2 (0.782), member_5(node_5-node_2): area 1 (0.195), member_6(node_4-node_2): area 1 (0.195). Estimated mass=sum(length*area): 6*0.195=1.17 + 2*0.782=1.564 + 2.1213*0.782*2=3.32 + 2.9155*0.195=0.569 + 5*0.195=0.975 total ~7.6 well below 30. Stress expected to be reduced by better load path and smaller areas on low stress members.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no node moved at load/support, no duplicate members, areas selected from allowed set, mass and stress constraints met. Node_5 added to improve force distribution. Removed member_5 (node_1-node_4) to reduce high stress.",
