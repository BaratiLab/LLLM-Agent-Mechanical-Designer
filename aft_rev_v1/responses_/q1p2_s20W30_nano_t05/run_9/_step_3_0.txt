  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while keeping constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress ~9.54 < 20, total mass ~26.65 < 30, structure stable. Load at node_3, supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Node_4 moved progressively from (2.5,3.0) to (2.15,3.45) reducing stress. Members mostly area_id '2' or '3'.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_2 (-9.54), compressive. Member_2 connects node_1 and node_3 (fixed load at node_3). Node_4 position affects stress distribution in diagonal members (4,5,6). Increasing height of node_4 helped reduce stress. Current height 3.45, previous 3.3 and 3.0. Mass slightly increased but within limit. To reduce stress further, try slight repositioning of node_4 upwards and slightly right to better align force paths and reduce member_2 compression.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_4 y increased from 3.0 to 3.45 reduced max stress from ~10.5 to ~9.54. Maybe increasing y further to ~3.6 and shifting x slightly to ~2.3 can balance forces better, reduce compression in member_2. Keep other nodes fixed due to load/support constraints. Area selections remain same as current iteration as they balance mass and stress well.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_2 under compression is critical. Increasing node_4 height increases diagonal members' length and stiffness in tension/compression paths. Slight right shift may reduce bending and redistribute load more evenly. Avoid large increases in height to prevent mass increase beyond 30. Areas 2 and 3 are optimal for balancing mass and strength. No member area change needed now. This small node_4 adjustment can reduce max stress further without mass penalty.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Try node_4 at (2.3, 3.6). Member lengths: node_1-node_4 ~ sqrt((2.3)^2 + (3.6)^2)=~4.34, node_3-node_4 ~ sqrt((0.3)^2 + (3.6)^2)=~3.62, node_2-node_4 ~ sqrt((3.7)^2 + (3.6)^2)=~5.16. Mass roughly similar or slightly increased but <30. Expect stress redistribution lowering max compressive stress on member_2.",
  
  "calculation": "Update node_4 to (2.3, 3.6). Keep members and areas as is. Expect max stress <9.54 and mass <=26.8. This should improve stress distribution and keep constraints satisfied.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved to (2.3, 3.6) for improved force distribution. No member or node changes except node_4 position. Mass and stress constraints met. Continue optimization if stress reduction significant in next iteration.",
