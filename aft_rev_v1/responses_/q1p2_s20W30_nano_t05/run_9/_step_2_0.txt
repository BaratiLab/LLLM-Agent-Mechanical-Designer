  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while keeping constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress ~9.91 < 20, total mass ~26.17 < 30, load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved from (2.5,3.0) to (2.3,3.3) improved max stress. Goal: further reduce max stress by repositioning node_4 within constraints.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is compressive on member_2 (-9.91), others are well below limit. Mass is below max allowed. Node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed due to supports and load. Node_4 can move to optimize force distribution and reduce peak stress. Members connect nodes forming a closed truss. Slight upward and horizontal adjustment of node_4 can balance force paths and reduce stress concentration on member_2.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_2 has highest compressive stress; reducing length or changing angles can reduce stress. Node_4 movement affects members 4,5,6. Increasing height can reduce horizontal force on member_2. Need to keep truss closed and stable.",
  
  "reasoning": "Increase node_4 y slightly more than 3.3 to increase vertical component of forces in upper members, reducing compression in member_2. Slightly shift node_4 x closer to node_3 to balance forces. Keep node_4 within feasible region to maintain truss shape and avoid excessive member length increase (mass). Areas can remain same as current iteration to avoid mass increase.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_4: (2.3,3.3). Try (2.1,3.5) or (2.2,3.4). Check member lengths and estimate stress reduction by better force distribution. Member_2 length ~4.0, decreasing compression by better force path through node_4.",
  
  "calculation": "Set node_4 to (2.15, 3.45). This increases vertical height by 0.15 and shifts x by -0.15. Member lengths: node_1-node_4 ~3.82, node_3-node_4 ~3.52, node_2-node_4 ~3.99. Slight increase but within reason. Expect compression on member_2 to reduce below 9.5. Mass roughly same, stress better distributed.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Check no duplicate nodes or members, maintain closed truss. Areas unchanged: member_1,2,3 area '2'; member_4,5 area '3'; member_6 area '2'. Constraints satisfied. Optimization continues as stress can be further improved.",
