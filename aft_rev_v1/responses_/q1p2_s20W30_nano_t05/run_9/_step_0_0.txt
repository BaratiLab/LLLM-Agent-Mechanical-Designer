  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes: node_1(0,0) pinned, node_2(6,0) roller, node_3(2,0) loaded (-10N @ -45°). Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass 30. Area options given. Need closed truss (all nodes connected). First iteration, no node position changes for given nodes.",
  
  "analysis": "Load at node_3 is downward-left. Supports at node_1 and node_2 fix horizontal and vertical reactions respectively. Existing nodes are colinear on x-axis, so structure is unstable without vertical members or additional nodes. To close truss, add a node above the line to form triangles, improving stability and distributing stresses. Use minimal extra node to keep mass low. Use simple triangular truss with members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_2 (base), plus node_4 above to form two triangles: node_1-node_4-node_3 and node_3-node_4-node_2. Place node_4 at (2.5, 3.0) approx for good height to reduce stress. Select member areas from given discrete values to keep stress within ±20 and mass ≤30. Approximate member lengths and forces using static equilibrium and truss method assumptions.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Plan: Add node_4 at (2.5,3.0). Members: (node_1-node_2), (node_1-node_3), (node_2-node_3), (node_1-node_4), (node_3-node_4), (node_2-node_4). Calculate lengths, estimate internal force distribution assuming pin-jointed truss, no bending. Use areas to keep stress within limits. Mass = sum(length * area).",
  
  "reasoning": "Adding node_4 creates two triangular sub-trusses sharing node_3, improving load path. Triangles are stable and distribute forces efficiently. Using node_4 at 3m height balances vertical and horizontal force components from load at node_3. Member areas set larger for members under higher forces and smaller for others to minimize mass. Stress = Force / (area × cross-section factor assumed 1 here for simplicity). Max stress ±20 limits force/area ratio. Mass approximated as sum(length × area).",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Members and lengths:\n- node_1-node_2: length=6.0\n- node_1-node_3: length=2.0\n- node_2-node_3: length=4.0\n- node_1-node_4: sqrt((2.5-0)^2 + (3.0-0)^2)=3.905\n- node_3-node_4: sqrt((2.5-2)^2 + (3.0-0)^2)=3.041\n- node_2-node_4: sqrt((6-2.5)^2 + (3.0-0)^2)=4.716\n\nAssuming load at node_3 (-10N at -45°) decomposes to Fx=-7.07N, Fy=-7.07N. Supports reaction forces balance these. Internal forces estimated by method of joints or sections.\n\nAssign areas:\n- High force members: area=4 (3.128) or 5 (4.887)\n- Low force members: area=1 (0.195) or 2 (0.782)\n\nEstimate mass and check if ≤30.\n",
