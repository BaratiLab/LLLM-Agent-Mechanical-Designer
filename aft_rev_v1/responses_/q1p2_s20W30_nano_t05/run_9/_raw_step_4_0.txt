Current max stress ~9.7, mass ~27.3, all constraints met. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved iteratively to reduce stress.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has max stress ~9.7, well below ±20 limit, and mass ~27.3 < 30. Stress distribution is balanced with moderate compression and tension. Node_4 position changes from 3.0 to 3.6 in y improved stress but increased mass slightly. Area selections are consistent, no oversized members. Load and supports fixed as per instructions.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further node_4 movement risks increasing member lengths, raising mass and stress. Current stress distribution is balanced. Member_2 under highest compression (-9.7), member_5 moderate tension (-4.0). Members use area \'2\' or \'3\' mostly, balancing mass and strength.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Node_4 position optimized near (2.3, 3.6) to balance vertical load transfer and member forces. Moving node_4 further up or sideways likely increases member lengths and mass. Reducing cross-sectional areas risks exceeding stress limits. Current design meets constraints with margin. No duplicate nodes or members. Load/support nodes fixed per instructions. Stress minimization achieved by geometry optimization and area selection.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: approx member_1 (6.0), member_2 (2.0), member_3 (4.0), member_4 (~4.3), member_5 (~4.0), member_6 (~4.0). Areas chosen \'2\' and \'3\' per member. Mass and stress consistent with length×area. Max stress ~9.7 < 20, total mass ~27.3 < 30. Further optimization unlikely without adding complexity or violating constraints.",\n\n  "calculation": "No area changes needed; all members sized to keep stress under limit. Node_4 at (2.3, 3.6) optimal for load path and stress balance. Total mass 27.29 < 30, max stress 9.71 < 20. Load (-10, -45°) at node_3 well supported by current geometry. Supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. No member or node duplication. Design is a closed truss with 4 nodes and 6 members.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints satisfied, stress minimized sufficiently, mass below max. Node_4 position optimized.
