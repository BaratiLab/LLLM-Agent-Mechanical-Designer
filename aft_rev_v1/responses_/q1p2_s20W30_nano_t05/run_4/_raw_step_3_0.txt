Current max stress 47 > 20 limit, mass 26.45 < 30 limit. Need to reduce max stress below 20, keep mass ≤ 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high compressive stress (-47) in member_5 (node_3-node_4). Member_5 area is minimal (0.195). Increasing area or adding members to redistribute load is needed. Node_6 at (3,3) helps, but stress still high. Members near load and top nodes should be reinforced. Load node_3 at (2,0) is critical. Current members connected to node_3 are member_4, member_5, member_6. Member_6 (node_3-node_2) has tensile stress 24.7 > 20. So both member_5 and member_6 overstressed. Need to reduce these stresses by adding support members or redistributing geometry.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Options: add a node above or to the right of node_3 to create a triangular bracing, increase areas on critical members, or modify topology to reduce stress. Avoid increasing mass beyond 30. Members with zero or low stress can have reduced area to compensate for increases elsewhere.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node (node_7) at (4.0, 3.0) to extend top chord and create additional bracing. Connect node_7 to node_6 and node_2. Add member from node_3 to node_7 to reduce load on member_5 and member_6. Increase cross-sectional areas of members from node_3 to nodes_4, 6, and 7 to 2 (0.782) or 3 (1.759) for stress reduction. Reduce area of low-stress members to compensate mass. Remove member_6 (node_3-node_2) to reduce tensile overload, replaced by node_7 connections. Final member set: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_6, node_6-node_7, node_7-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_3-node_6, node_3-node_7.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_7 creates a longer top chord distributing load better, reducing stress on members connected to node_3. Removing direct node_3-node_2 member reduces tensile stress concentration. Increasing area on members around node_3 reduces stress. Reducing area on low-stress members keeps total mass under 30. Triangular bracing ensures structural stability and load path efficiency.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_1-node_4 ≈ 3.605, node_4-node_6 = 1.0, node_6-node_7 = 1.0, node_7-node_2 ≈ 2.236, node_3-node_4 = 3.0, node_3-node_6 ≈ 1.414, node_3-node_7 ≈ 2.828.
