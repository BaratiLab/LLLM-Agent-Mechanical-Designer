Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current design exceeds stress (124.97) and mass (33.17).",\n  \n  "analysis": "High tensile stress on member_8 (node_3-node_6) at area 1 causes failure. Mass is slightly above limit mainly due to large area members (area 4 and 3). Current topology has direct long members from node_3 to node_6 and node_4. Load direction is diagonal; members should align to transfer load efficiently to supports.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing area on highly stressed member_8 is ineffective due to stress concentration. Adding intermediate nodes to better distribute forces and reduce member lengths could help. Use smaller areas on tension members and larger areas on compression members. Avoid direct long members with small area causing high stress.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add intermediate node between node_3 and node_6 to split long member_8. Remove member_8 direct connection (node_3-node_6). Add members connecting node_3 to new node, new node to node_6, and new node to node_4 to form a triangular substructure. Adjust member areas to reduce stress and mass. Keep existing nodes for load/support fixed.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Introducing an intermediate node reduces member length and stress concentration. Triangular substructure improves load path and structural stability. Using area 2 (0.782) or 3 (1.759) for compression members and area 1 (0.195) for tension members balances mass and strength. Removing direct node_3-node_6 member with small area eliminates stress peak.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths, assign areas, estimate stresses proportional to load path.
