Current max stress 250+ exceeds ±20 limit, mass 16.65 < 30 allowed. Need to reduce stress drastically.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has high stress on members 2,3,7 (up to ±250), indicating poor force distribution. Members with area \'1\' (0.195) too small for load. Mass is low, so can increase member areas or add members to redistribute forces. Load at node_3 downward-left requires strong diagonal and vertical support. Existing nodes mostly aligned vertically at x=2-3, limiting load paths. Adding nodes to create stable triangular substructures can help reduce stress. Avoid long slender members with small areas. Use larger areas on critical load paths.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add nodes between node_3 and node_4, node_6 to create multiple load paths. Use diagonals from load node_3 to supports. Increase member areas on main load-carrying members. Keep mass ≤30 by balancing member areas and lengths.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add one node (node_16) at (2.5,1.0) between node_3 and node_4 vertically to form triangles. Connect node_3 to node_16, node_16 to node_4 and node_6. Use larger areas on members from node_1 and node_2 to node_4 and node_6. Use areas 4 or 5 for main vertical and diagonal members. Use area 2 for smaller members. Remove member_7 (node_3-node_6) which had high stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular configurations improve load distribution and reduce stress concentrations. Increasing member areas reduces stress. Removing direct long member from node_3 to node_6 avoids high stress. Adding intermediate node_16 allows load transfer via multiple paths. Supports at node_1 and node_2 provide reaction forces to balance load at node_3. This layout balances load and keeps mass under limit.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths for mass estimate. Use areas: 4=3.128, 5=4.887, 2=0.782.
