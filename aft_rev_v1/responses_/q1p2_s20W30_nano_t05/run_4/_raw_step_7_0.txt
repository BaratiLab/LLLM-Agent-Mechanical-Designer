Max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current iteration 6 has max stress 27.4 > 20 and mass 28.6 < 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has overstressed members (members 5,6,7 exceed ±20). Mass is close to limit but acceptable. Members around node_9 carry high compressive stress. Node_10 and its members add complexity but do not reduce max stress below limits. Load path from node_3 to supports needs better distribution and stronger tension/compression members with optimized cross-section areas. Current high stresses indicate need for better triangulation and possibly relocation or addition of nodes to reduce member length and stress concentration.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_10 to simplify. Add an intermediate node between node_4 and node_2 to improve load path. Increase cross-section of critical members within mass budget. Use lower areas on low-stress members and higher areas on highly stressed members. Keep node_3 fixed at (2,0) due to load, supports fixed. Add node_11 at (4.0, 3.0) to form better triangulation. Connect node_3, node_4, node_6, node_11, node_2 with members to distribute forces.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_10 and members connected to it. Add node_11 at (4.0,3.0).

Adjust cross-section areas to keep stresses within ±20 and mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing node_10 reduces complexity and low-stress members. Adding node_11 at (4,3) creates a stronger triangular truss segment near node_2. Members from node_3 to node_11 and node_6 provide alternate load paths reducing stress in any single member. Using larger areas on members under high stress and smaller on others balances mass. This layout improves stiffness and load distribution, lowering max stress below 20.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths and assign areas: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2,3), node_6(3,3), node_11(4,3).
