Load at node_3 (-10, -45°). Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Current max stress 504.97 and mass 34.36 exceed limits. Need redesign or modification.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design fails due to very high stress on members connected to node_3 and intermediate nodes (node_14, 15, 16). Large cross sections (area_id=4) on main members cause high mass. Members near load have excessive stress due to load eccentricity and insufficient bracing. Structure is too complex with many small members causing stress concentration.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce complexity near load node_3. Add direct bracing from load to supports. Use smaller cross sections where possible. Increase height of truss for better load distribution. Avoid intermediate nodes close to load that cause stress concentration. Maintain pinned and roller supports at nodes 1 and 2. Use area sizes to balance stress and mass.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Simplify truss with nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0) load, node_4(2,3), node_6(4,3). Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_6, node_6-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_3-node_6, node_3-node_2. Use moderate cross sections to reduce mass and control stress. Remove intermediate nodes 14,15,16 to reduce stress concentration and mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "A classic triangular truss with a top chord at y=3m distributes load efficiently. Direct members from load node_3 to top chord and right support node_2 reduce bending and stress concentration. Using area_id=3 or 2 on main members balances mass and strength. Smaller area_id=1 on shorter members reduces mass. Avoiding complex intermediate nodes reduces stress peaks and mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_1-node_4: 3m, node_4-node_6: 2m, node_6-node_2: 3m, node_3-node_4: 3m, node_3-node_6: ~2.236m, node_3-node_2: 4m. Assign area_id 3 (1.759) to main chords, area_id 2 (0.782) to diagonals. Estimate mass = sum(length * area). Check stress: expect reduced max stress <20 due to direct load paths and balanced geometry.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Mass calculation: \\nmember_1 (node_1-node_4): 3m * 1.759 = 5.277\\nmember_2 (node_4-node_6): 2m * 1.759 = 3.518\\nmember_3 (node_6-node_2): 3m * 1.759 = 5.277\\nmember_4 (node_3-node_4): 3m * 0.782 = 2.346\\nmember_5 (node_3-node_6): 2.236m * 0.782 = 1.749\\nmember_6 (node_3-node_2): 4m * 0.782 = 3.128\\nTotal mass approx = 21.295 < 30, satisfying mass constraint.\\nStress expected less than ±20 due to direct load paths and adequate cross sections.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Structure simplified, mass reduced, stress paths improved.
