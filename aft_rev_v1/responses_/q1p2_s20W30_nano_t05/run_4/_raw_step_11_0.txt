Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Current max stress 97.6 > 20, mass 31.3 > 30. Need lighter and more balanced force paths. Areas from 0.195 to 19.548. Nodes fixed at supports and load.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high stress in members connected to node_3 and node_4. Member_7 (node_3-node_4) has -97.6 stress, overshooting compressive limit. Mass exceeds limit by ~1.3. Adding node_12 helped but stress concentration remains. Member areas are large on node_1-node_4 and node_6-node_2, but stress distribution is uneven. Load at node_3 causes high bending forces in short members. Structural redundancy is low around load. Need better triangulation and shorter members near load to reduce stress and mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding node near node_3 to split load path. Use smaller area members on low stress members. Rebalance member sizes. Possibly relocate or add node between node_3 and node_4 lower than node_12 (at 3,1.5) to reduce moment arm. Remove or reduce large area member_1 (node_1-node_4) to reduce mass. Use 3 or 2 area for main load paths. Avoid long slender members with high stress.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_13 at (2.5,1.0) between node_3 and node_4 to improve triangulation and reduce bending. Connect node_3-node_13, node_13-node_4, node_13-node_6. Remove member_7 (node_3-node_4) to avoid large stress. Use area 3 (1.759) for main load-carrying members, area 1 (0.195) for secondary. Keep existing supports and load nodes fixed.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_13 at (2.5,1.0) creates two shorter members instead of one long member_7, reducing bending moment and stress. Connecting node_13 to node_6 adds load path and triangulation, reducing stress in node_3 members. Removing member_7 reduces mass and stress concentration. Using moderate areas balances mass and strength. This layout improves force flow from load to supports, reducing max stress and total mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_3-node_13 ~1.118, node_13-node_4 ~2.236, node_13-node_6 ~2.236.

Sum = 9.384+1.759+9.384+1.965+3.933+3.933 = 30.358. Slightly above 30, reduce member_1 area to 3 (1.759) to save mass: 3*3=9.0 instead of 9.384. New total mass ~29.974 <30.
