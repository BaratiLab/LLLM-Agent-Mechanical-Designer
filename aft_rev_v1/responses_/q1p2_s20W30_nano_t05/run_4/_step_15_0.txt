  "preamble": "Current 2D truss design meets constraints with low max stress and acceptable mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress is 8.23 < 20 limit, total mass 24.5 < 30 max. Nodes fixed at supports and load. Members use areas 2 and 3. Structure is closed and stable.",
  "analysis": "The structure has low max stress (8.23) and total mass well below limit (24.5). Stress distribution is balanced, no member exceeds Â±20. Node positions at load and supports are fixed. Intermediate nodes adjusted to optimize stress.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further stress reduction unlikely without increasing mass or changing fixed nodes. Current design uses moderate cross sections and has minimal stress concentrations. Structure is statically determinate and stable.",
  "reasoning": "Given constraints and fixed nodes, the current design balances member areas and geometry to minimize stress. Attempts to reduce stress further would require either increasing member areas (increasing mass) or repositioning fixed nodes (not allowed). Hence, the current design is near optimal.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Max stress = 8.23 < 20, total mass = 24.5 < 30. Members with area '3' (1.759) and '2' (0.782) provide sufficient capacity. Load at node_3 is properly supported by triangular truss formed by nodes 1,4,6,3,2. No stress violations.",
  "calculation": "Checked member stresses and mass sums. Member lengths consistent with node coordinates. Areas selected to keep mass under 30 while minimizing stress. No member stress close to limit, so no immediate need to increase area or reposition nodes.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints satisfied. No duplicate nodes/members. Fixed load/support nodes unchanged. Node positions precise. No further improvement feasible under constraints. Optimization can stop.",
