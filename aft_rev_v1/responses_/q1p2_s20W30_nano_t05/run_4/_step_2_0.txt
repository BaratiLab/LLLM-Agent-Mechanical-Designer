  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to satisfy max stress ±20 and mass ≤30 under given loads and supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 28.2 > 20, mass 24.5 < 30. Need stress reduction mainly in member_6 and member_2. Load at node_3 downward-left, supports at node_1(pinned), node_2(roller).",
  
  "analysis": "Stress exceeded in members connected to node_3 and node_5, especially member_6 (node_3-node_2) and member_2 (node_4-node_5). Current structure uses 5 nodes, added node_5 created longer members with higher stress. Member areas vary, with member_1 large area (4) but still high compressive stress. The load at node_3 is critical; node_3 is on bottom chord, possibly causing large bending. Current design is a complex truss with diagonal members from node_3 to nodes 4 and 5, and node_5 to node_2. Mass is acceptable but stress is not. To reduce stress, better force paths and more triangulation needed. Node_3 is fixed (load), node_1 and node_2 fixed (supports).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider removing node_5 to reduce complexity and redistribute forces. Add a new node above node_3 to create a vertical or diagonal member to reduce bending. Use more triangulation between supports and load node. Use moderate areas to balance mass and stress. Avoid very large areas that add mass. Use member length and area to estimate mass. Aim for max stress ≤ 20, mass ≤ 30.",
  
  "proposal": "Remove node_5. Add new node_6 above node_3 at (3.0, 3.0). Connect members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_6, node_6-node_2, node_3-node_6, node_3-node_4, node_3-node_2. Use areas to reduce stress: larger areas on members carrying higher load, smaller areas on less stressed. This creates a stable triangulated truss with better load distribution and less bending at node_3.",
  
  "reasoning": "Removing node_5 reduces long members causing stress. Adding node_6 above node_3 creates a vertical load path and triangulation with node_4 and node_2, reducing bending and stress in members connected to node_3. Members connecting node_3 to node_6 and node_4 share load. Members from node_6 to node_2 and node_4 to node_1 provide stable support. Areas assigned to keep mass under 30 and stress under 20. Using area ids: 4 (3.128), 3 (1.759), 2 (0.782), 1 (0.195) as needed.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths: node_1(0,0)-node_4(2,3) ~3.605, node_4(2,3)-node_6(3,3) =1.0, node_6(3,3)-node_2(6,0) ~4.243, node_3(2,0)-node_6(3,3) ~3.162, node_3(2,0)-node_4(2,3)=3.0, node_3(2,0)-node_2(6,0)=4.0. Assign areas: member_1(node_1-node_4): 4; member_2(node_4-node_6): 2; member_3(node_6-node_2): 4; member_4(node_3-node_6): 3; member_5(node_3-node_4): 1; member_6(node_3-node_2): 1.

Reduce member_3 area to 3 (1.759): 4.243*1.759=7.46, total mass ~25.45 under 30.",
  
  "calculation": "Final areas: member_1:4 (3.128), member_2:2 (0.782), member_3:3 (1.759), member_4:3 (1.759), member_5:1 (0.195), member_6:1 (0.195).
