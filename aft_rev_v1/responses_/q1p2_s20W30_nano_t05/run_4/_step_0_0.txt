  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss with 3 nodes, given loads and supports, minimizing stress and mass within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes: node_1 pinned at (0,0), node_2 roller at (6,0), node_3 loaded at (2,0). Load at node_3 is -10N at -45°. Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass 30. Need closed truss (all nodes connected).",
  
  "analysis": "Nodes lie on x-axis. Load at node_3 is downward-left diagonal force. Supports fix horizontal and vertical at node_1, vertical only at node_2. To form closed truss, connect nodes as triangle: node_1-node_2, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_1. Triangular truss is statically determinate and stable. Optimize member areas to keep stress ≤ 20 and mass ≤ 30.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Triangle members lengths: n1-n2 = 6.0, n2-n3 = 4.4721, n3-n1 = 2.0. Assign areas from given set. Calculate axial forces from equilibrium, then stress = force/area. Adjust areas to keep stress ≤ 20 and minimize mass (length × area).",
  
  "reasoning": "Assume linear elastic members, axial forces only. Calculate reactions at supports by equilibrium. Resolve load at node_3 into components Fx = -10*cos45° ≈ -7.071N, Fy = -10*sin45° ≈ -7.071N. Use method of joints or sections to find member forces. Use stress = force/area ≤ 20. Select minimum areas meeting stress and mass constraints. Mass = sum(length × area).",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Reactions: sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, sum moments=0. Calculate reactions at node_1 and node_2. Then find member forces at node_3 joint. Calculate stress = F/area. Adjust area to keep stress ≤ 20. Use smallest area possible to minimize mass.",
  
  "calculation": "Load components at node_3: Fx = -7.071N, Fy = -7.071N. Reactions: sum Fx=0 => R1x + R2x + Fx = 0; roller at node_2 only vertical, so R2x=0; R1x=7.071N. Sum Fy=0 => R1y + R2y + Fy = 0. Sum moments about node_1: R2y*6 - 7.071*2 = 0 => R2y = (7.071*2)/6 = 2.357N; then R1y = 7.071 - 2.357 = 4.714N. Member forces: at node_3, members n3-n1 and n3-n2. Using geometry and equilibrium at node_3: member n3-n1 force F31, member n3-n2 force F32. Solve via joint equilibrium: Fx: F31*cosθ31 + F32*cosθ32 = Fx; Fy: F31*sinθ31 + F32*sinθ32 = Fy. Angles: n3-n1 vector (0-2,0-0) = (-2,0), angle 180°, cos180=-1, sin180=0; n3-n2 vector (6-2,0-0)=(4,0), angle 0°, cos0=1, sin0=0. Fx: -F31 + F32 = -7.071; Fy: 0 + 0 = -7.071 => Contradiction implies vertical load at node_3 is carried by vertical member? Actually, all nodes on x-axis, no vertical members => vertical load cannot be carried by axial forces in horizontal members alone. Need to add a node above x-axis to carry vertical load. Add node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) to form a triangular shape with node_3, allowing vertical force resolution. New members: n3-n4, n4-n1, n4-n2. Recalculate member lengths and forces with node_4. Lengths: n3-n4=3.0, n4-n1=3.6056, n4-n2=4.4721. Now the truss is a quadrilateral with a diagonal, closed and stable. Assign areas to members to keep stress ≤ 20 and mass ≤ 30. Approximate forces via joint method. Assign areas from set to minimize mass.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Added node_4 at (2.0,3.0) to resolve vertical load. Members: n1-n2, n2-n3, n3-n4, n4-n1, n4-n2. Calculate member forces and assign areas accordingly. Check total mass ≤ 30 and max stress ≤ 20. No duplicate nodes or members.",
