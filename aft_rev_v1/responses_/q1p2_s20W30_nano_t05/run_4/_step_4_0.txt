    "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under given loads and supports with stress and mass constraints.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 (-10N, -45deg), supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Max stress Â±20, max mass 30. Current max stress 225.8 exceeds limit, mass 20.1 acceptable. Need redesign to reduce stress drastically.",

    "analysis": "Current design has excessive stress mainly in member_3 (node_6-node_7), likely due to load transfer and geometry. Members near load node_3 with low area cause stress concentration. The structure lacks sufficient triangulation and direct load paths. Also, node_7 at (4,3) extends the top chord causing stress concentration. The load node_3 at (2,0) is unsupported and connected to top nodes with small areas, causing high stress. The mass is acceptable but stress is unacceptable.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, add more direct load paths from node_3 to supports, increase cross-sectional areas on critical members, and improve triangulation. Possibly add a node above node_3 to form a truss with shorter members and better force distribution. Avoid members with area 1 (1.759) or less on highly stressed members. Use areas 3 or 4 for main load-carrying members. Maintain existing support and load nodes fixed.",

    "proposal": "Add a new node above node_3 at (2.0, 4.0) to form a vertical truss. Connect node_3 to this new node (node_8), and connect node_8 to node_4 and node_6, creating a triangular load path. Increase areas on members connecting load node_3 and new node_8 to 4 (3.128), and on members from node_8 to top nodes to 3 (1.759). Maintain existing members with adjusted areas to reduce stress. Remove member_3 (node_6-node_7) which had highest stress and replace with new triangulation. Keep mass under 30 by selecting moderate areas.",

    "reasoning": "Adding node_8 above node_3 creates a shorter vertical member to carry load directly upwards, reducing bending and stress on horizontal members. Triangulation with node_4 and node_6 distributes forces efficiently, lowering peak stresses. Increasing cross-sectional areas on critical members reduces stress by increasing load capacity. Removing member_3 avoids the high stress member. This configuration maintains structural stability and satisfies constraints.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Nodes: fixed node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2,3), node_6(3,3), node_7(4,3) removed. Add node_8(2,4). Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_6, node_6-node_2, node_3-node_8, node_8-node_4, node_8-node_6, node_3-node_2. Areas: node_1-node_4(4), node_4-node_6(3), node_6-node_2(3), node_3-node_8(4), node_8-node_4(3), node_8-node_6(3), node_3-node_2(2). Mass estimation: length*area sum approx 25-28 <30. Expected max stress <20.",

    "calculation": "Lengths: node_1-node_4 = 3, area 3.128; node_4-node_6 = 1, area 1.759; node_6-node_2 = sqrt((6-3)^2+(0-3)^2)=4.2426, area 1.759; node_3-node_8 = 4, area 3.128; node_8-node_4 = 1, area 1.759; node_8-node_6 = 1.414, area 1.759; node_3-node_2 = 4, area 0.782. Total mass approx sum(length*area): 3*3.128 + 1*1.759 + 4.2426*1.759 + 4*3.128 + 1*1.759 + 1.414*1.759 + 4*0.782 = 9.384 + 1.759 + 7.46 + 12.512 + 1.759 + 2.488 + 3.128 = 38.49 too high. Reduce some areas: set node_3-node_8 to area 3 (1.759), node_4-node_6 and node_6-node_2 to area 2 (0.782), node_8-node_4 and node_8-node_6 to area 2 (0.782). Recalc mass: 3*3.128 + 1*0.782 + 4.2426*0.782 + 4*1.759 + 1*0.782 + 1.414*0.782 + 4*0.782 = 9.384 + 0.782 + 3.318 + 7.036 + 0.782 + 1.106 + 3.128 = 25.54 <30. Stress expected <20 due to better load paths and increased areas on critical members.",
