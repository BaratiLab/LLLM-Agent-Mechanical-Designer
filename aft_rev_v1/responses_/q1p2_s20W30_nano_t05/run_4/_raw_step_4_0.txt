Max stress Â±20, max mass 30. Current max stress 225.8 exceeds limit, mass 20.1 acceptable. Need redesign to reduce stress drastically.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current design has excessive stress mainly in member_3 (node_6-node_7), likely due to load transfer and geometry. Members near load node_3 with low area cause stress concentration. The structure lacks sufficient triangulation and direct load paths. Also, node_7 at (4,3) extends the top chord causing stress concentration. The load node_3 at (2,0) is unsupported and connected to top nodes with small areas, causing high stress. The mass is acceptable but stress is unacceptable.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, add more direct load paths from node_3 to supports, increase cross-sectional areas on critical members, and improve triangulation. Possibly add a node above node_3 to form a truss with shorter members and better force distribution. Avoid members with area 1 (1.759) or less on highly stressed members. Use areas 3 or 4 for main load-carrying members. Maintain existing support and load nodes fixed.",\n\n    "proposal": "Add a new node above node_3 at (2.0, 4.0) to form a vertical truss. Connect node_3 to this new node (node_8), and connect node_8 to node_4 and node_6, creating a triangular load path. Increase areas on members connecting load node_3 and new node_8 to 4 (3.128), and on members from node_8 to top nodes to 3 (1.759). Maintain existing members with adjusted areas to reduce stress. Remove member_3 (node_6-node_7) which had highest stress and replace with new triangulation. Keep mass under 30 by selecting moderate areas.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Adding node_8 above node_3 creates a shorter vertical member to carry load directly upwards, reducing bending and stress on horizontal members. Triangulation with node_4 and node_6 distributes forces efficiently, lowering peak stresses. Increasing cross-sectional areas on critical members reduces stress by increasing load capacity. Removing member_3 avoids the high stress member. This configuration maintains structural stability and satisfies constraints.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Nodes: fixed node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2,3), node_6(3,3), node_7(4,3) removed.
