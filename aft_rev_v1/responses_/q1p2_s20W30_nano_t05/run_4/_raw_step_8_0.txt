Current mass 36.6 > 30, max stress ~20 within limit but close. Need to reduce mass while keeping stresses ≤20.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has heavy members with large areas (area_id=4), especially members from node_3 to node_11 and node_1 to node_4. Mass exceeds limit mainly due to large cross sections and long members. Member_7 (node_3-node_11) has high mass (11.28), member_1 and member_4 also heavy. Member stresses are near limits, so reducing area must be done carefully. Load at node_3 pulls diagonally down-left, so truss must efficiently transfer load to supports at node_1 and node_2. Triangular bracing near node_3 and node_4 is good for stability. Current topology is close but mass too high.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce cross-sectional areas on longer members while maintaining stress limits. Possibly remove node_11 and replace with node_9 at (4,1.5) from earlier iteration to reduce member lengths. Use smaller areas on diagonal members carrying less force. Keep node_4 and node_6 for vertical support. Optimize area distribution with smaller areas on less stressed members.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_11 and members connected to it. Add node_9 at (4.0, 1.5) for shorter diagonal bracing. Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_6, node_6-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_3-node_6, node_3-node_9, node_9-node_2, node_9-node_6, node_9-node_4. Use area_ids mostly 2 or less except main vertical members with area_id=4 for strength. This reduces mass and keeps stresses within ±20.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Shorter members reduce length × area product, reducing mass. Using area_id=4 only on main vertical members (node_1-node_4 and node_6-node_2) to carry high compressive loads. Diagonal members near load node_3 have smaller areas (area_id=1 or 2) to reduce mass but still carry load. Node_9 placed at (4.0,1.5) reduces length of diagonal members compared to node_11 at (4,3). Triangular bracing with node_4, node_6, and node_9 ensures stiffness and load distribution. This topology balances mass and stress constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_4 = 3.0, node_4-node_6 = 1.0, node_6-node_2 ≈ 3.162, node_3-node_4 = 3.0, node_3-node_6 ≈ 1.414, node_3-node_9 ≈ 2.5, node_9-node_2 ≈ 1.5, node_9-node_6 ≈ 1.802, node_9-node_4 ≈ 1.802.
