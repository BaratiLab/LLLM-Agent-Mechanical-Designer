Current design overshoots stress and mass. Load is -10 at 45° down-left on node_3. Supports fixed. Need lighter, less stressed truss with stable geometry.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has excessive compressive and tensile stresses (up to ±90) and mass slightly above 30. Members near node_3 and node_9 are overstressed. The truss has many slender members with small areas, causing stress concentration. The load is applied on node_3 at base line, causing bending and high stress on diagonal members. Structure is not efficiently distributing loads to supports.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, add vertical and diagonal bracing to transfer load efficiently. Increase cross-section area of critical load path members but keep overall mass ≤30. Simplify geometry to reduce redundant members and redistribute forces. Maintain node_1, node_2, node_3 positions. Add one node vertically above node_3 to create stable triangular substructures.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_10 above node_3 at (2.0, 2.5). Connect node_10 to node_3, node_4, and node_6. Remove node_9 to reduce complexity. Use areas to keep stresses ≤20 and mass ≤30. Use larger areas on main load path members (node_3 to node_10, node_10 to supports). Use moderate areas on bracing members. Retain members from node_1 to node_4 and node_4 to node_6 for stability.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_10 above node_3 transfers vertical load directly upward, reducing bending in horizontal members. Triangular bracing with node_4 and node_6 improves load distribution. Removing node_9 simplifies load paths and reduces mass. Increasing areas on main load path members reduces stress. Choosing area ids 4 or 3 for main members and 2 or 1 for bracing balances mass and strength.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Critical members: node_3-node_10, node_10-node_4, node_10-node_6, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_6, node_6-node_2. Assign area 4 to node_1-node_4 and node_6-node_2, area 3 to node_4-node_6 and node_3-node_10, area 2 to node_10-node_4 and node_10-node_6, area 1 to node_3-node_4, node_3-node_6.
