Load is downward-left at node_3. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Current max stress ~94 > 20 and mass ~35 > 30. Need redesign to better distribute forces and reduce member stresses and mass.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high stress on member_4 (node_3-node_12) and member_5 (node_12-node_6), indicating load path concentration. Member areas mostly 1 to 4. Mass is high due to long members with large areas. Node_13 appears to create redundant members with high stress. Structure lacks triangulation near load node_3 to efficiently transfer load to supports. Load node_3 is on bottom chord, no direct vertical support member from node_3 to top nodes or supports.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress and mass, remove node_13 and its members. Introduce a vertical or near vertical member from node_3 to a new node above it to create a triangular load path. Add a new node between node_4 and node_6 at mid height for better triangulation. Use smaller area members for less stressed members and larger areas only where needed. Keep node_1, node_2, and node_3 fixed as per constraints.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_13 and its members. Add node_14 at (2.0, 1.5) above node_3. Add node_15 at (2.5, 2.25) between node_4 and node_6. Connect node_3 to node_14 (area 2), node_14 to node_15 (area 2), node_15 to node_4 (area 1), node_15 to node_6 (area 1). Keep bottom chord members node_1-node_4 and node_6-node_2 with moderate areas. Connect node_3 to node_6 with smaller area. Remove redundant members. This layout creates triangles for load transfer and reduces stress concentrations.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular geometry improves structural stability and load distribution. Vertical member from load node_3 upwards reduces bending and tension in bottom chord. Mid-height node_15 creates two smaller triangles distributing forces. Using smaller areas on less stressed members reduces mass. Larger areas on main load paths (node_1-node_4, node_6-node_2) maintain strength. Removing node_13 and its members removes high stress concentration and redundant mass. This should reduce max stress below 20 and total mass below 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculations: node_3-node_14 vertical 1.5m, node_14-node_15 approx 1.12m, node_15-node_4 approx 0.75m, node_15-node_6 approx 0.75m, node_1-node_4 approx 3.0m, node_6-node_2 approx 3.0m, node_3-node_6 approx 3.16m.

Vertical and diagonal members from node_3 transfer load efficiently to supports. Smaller areas on less stressed members reduce mass. Triangles prevent bending and reduce member forces.
