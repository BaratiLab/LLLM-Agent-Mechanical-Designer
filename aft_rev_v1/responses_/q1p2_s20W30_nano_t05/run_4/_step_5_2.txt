  "preamble": "Optimizing 2D truss to meet max stress ±20 and mass ≤30 constraints under given loads/supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3: 10N at -45°. Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Current max stress 84.7 > 20, mass 25.08 < 30. Need stress reduction primarily in member_3 and member_7. Areas currently range from 1 to 4, some members underutilized. Nodes fixed at supports and load. Can add nodes to improve force paths, reduce long high-stress members.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design shows excessive tensile/compressive stress on member_3 (node_6-node_2) and member_7 (node_3-node_2). Member_7 is short but highly stressed, likely due to direct load transfer from node_3 to node_2. Member_3 carries high stress over a longer span. Members near load node_3 and between node_3 and node_2 are critical. Structure lacks sufficient triangulation near load to distribute forces efficiently. Adding intermediate nodes between node_3 and node_2 and reinforcing diagonal members can reduce stress. Member areas can be optimized to balance mass and stress. Current design mass is acceptable, so focus is on stress reduction by topology and member sizing.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding a node between node_3 and node_2 horizontally to reduce length and stress of member_7. Add vertical or diagonal members to better triangulate load path from node_3 to supports. Use smaller areas on low-stress members to save mass. Use moderate areas on critical tension/compression members. Avoid very large areas to keep mass under 30. Maintain current fixed nodes. Remove or replace high-stress members with multiple smaller members in parallel or triangulated form.",
  
  "proposal": "Add node_9 at (4.0, 1.5), between node_3 and node_2 horizontally but elevated to improve force distribution. Connect node_3 to node_9, node_9 to node_2, node_9 to node_6, and node_9 to node_4 to create multiple load paths. Keep existing members from node_1 and node_4, node_4 to node_6, node_6 to node_2 with adjusted areas. Remove direct member_7 (node_3-node_2) to reduce high stress. Use area ids 3 or 4 for main load members, 1 or 2 for secondary members to balance mass and stress. This topology improves triangulation and reduces stress concentration.",
  
  "reasoning": "Adding node_9 breaks long high-stress members into shorter segments, reducing axial stress. Multiple triangulated paths reduce load on any single member. Removing direct member_7 avoids direct high stress on short member. Adjusting member areas optimizes mass and stress. Node_9 position at (4.0,1.5) is chosen to balance vertical and horizontal load paths, improving force distribution from node_3's diagonal load. This improves structural stability and reduces peak stresses below ±20. Mass estimate remains below 30 with moderate areas.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_3(2,0) to node_9(4,1.5) ~2.5, node_9(4,1.5) to node_2(6,0) ~2.5, node_9 to node_6(3,3) ~1.8, node_9 to node_4(2,3) ~2.5. Use area 3 (1.759) or 4 (3.128) for primary members, area 1 (0.195) or 2 (0.782) for secondary. Mass approx = sum(length * area). Total mass estimate ~ (2.5*3.128 + 2.5*3.128 + 1.8*1.759 + 2.5*0.782) + existing members with adjusted areas ~ 25-28 < 30. Stress reduction expected by shorter members and triangulation.",
