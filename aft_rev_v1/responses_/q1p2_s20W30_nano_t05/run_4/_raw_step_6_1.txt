Current max stress 33.87 > 20; mass 30.2 ~ max 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design mass slightly exceeds limit; max stress exceeds ±20. Member_7 (node_9-node_4) stress 33.87 too high, area 1 (0.195) too small or geometry causes high stress. Members near load node_3 and node_9 critical. Geometry with node_9 at (4,1.5) causes stress concentration. Current members mostly short and low area except member_1 (area 4).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, add intermediate node(s) to redistribute load path, increase areas on high-stress members or shorten them. Reduce mass by removing unnecessary members or lowering area where stress is low. Keep supports and load nodes fixed. Avoid large area on long members to control mass.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add one new node (node_10) above node_9 to create a triangular load path and redistribute forces. Adjust member connections to form a stable truss with shorter members under load. Increase area on critical members to reduce stress below 20. Remove or reduce area on low-stress members to maintain mass <=30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_10 near (4.0, 2.5) creates a better load transfer from node_3 to supports via node_9 and node_10, reducing stress on member_7. Increase area of member_7 to \'2\' (0.782) to reduce stress. Use area \'2\' for members close to load and supports to balance stress and mass. Remove member_7 area \'1\' and assign \'2\'. Remove member_4 and member_5 area \'3\' to \'2\' to reduce mass but maintain strength. Keep member_1 area \'4\' for main support. This balances stress and mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_9(4,1.5) to node_10(4,2.5) = 1.0; node_10 to node_4(2,3) ≈ 2.06; node_3(2,0) to node_9(4,1.5) ≈ 2.5.
