Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current max stress 52.38 exceeds ±20 limit. Mass 13.37 under 30 limit. Need to reduce stress by redesigning members and areas.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high compressive stress (-52.38) in member_1 (node_1 to node_2) which is the bottom chord. Members near load (member_5, member_2) have moderate stresses but member_5 exceeds tensile limit (20.15 > 20). The triangular shape with node_4 at (2,3) is insufficient to reduce stress. Member_1 area is minimal (area_id=1 = 0.195), so increasing area there could help but increases mass. The structure lacks a vertical member from node_2 to node_4 or node_3 to node_2 to better distribute load.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding a new node above node_3 to form a more balanced truss. Possibly add a vertical member from node_3 to new node and diagonal members to supports to reduce bending and stress. Use larger areas on high stress members but keep mass in check. Remove member_1 (node_1-node_2) as it has high compressive stress and replace with a truss top chord at higher elevation.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (4.0, 3.5) above node_3 to create a truss top chord. Remove direct bottom chord member_1 (node_1-node_2). Connect node_1 to node_4, node_4 to node_5, node_5 to node_2, node_3 to node_5, node_3 to node_4, and node_3 to node_2. Assign areas to keep stresses within ±20 and mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 creates a truss top chord to better distribute load and reduce compressive stress in bottom chord. Removing direct bottom chord member reduces high compression. Adding diagonal members from node_5 to node_2 and node_3 improves load path. Assigning larger areas to bottom chord members and smaller to diagonal tension members balances mass and stress. The load at node_3 is better supported by vertical and diagonal members. Supports remain unchanged. Node_3 and node_2 remain at base line.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node positions: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (2,3), node_5 (4,3.5).
