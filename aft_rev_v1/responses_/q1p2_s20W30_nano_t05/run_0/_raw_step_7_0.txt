Minor oscillations in node_4 vertical position show little improvement. Member areas and connectivity remain consistent. Largest stress is compressive on member_6 but within limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further node_4 moves yield negligible stress reduction. Member areas optimized for load paths. No violations of constraints observed. Structure stable and efficient.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Given constraints and history, node_4 at (2.5,3.6) balances load distribution well. Member areas chosen reflect stress magnitude and length. Further optimization unlikely to reduce max stress significantly without increasing mass or violating constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress max ~9.13 <20, mass ~21.92 <30. Member lengths and areas consistent with stress demands. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed.
