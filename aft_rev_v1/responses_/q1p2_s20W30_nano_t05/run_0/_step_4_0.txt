  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while keeping constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress is 9.075 < 20 and mass 21.73 < 30. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_4 moved down from previous iterations to 2.3,3.5. Members use area ids 1,2,3. Stress concentrated on member_6 (-9.07).",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_6 (node_3-node_4) at -9.075, compressive. To reduce stress, better load path and geometry can be adjusted by moving node_4. Mass is well below max, so slight area increase possible if needed. Node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Current geometry forms a trapezoid with base 6m, node_4 near center. Member_6 is short and highly stressed.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Moving node_4 slightly closer to node_3 or changing vertical position may balance stresses. Possibly raise node_4 slightly and move horizontally closer to node_3 to reduce compressive stress on member_6. Maintain closed truss with all members intact. Keep areas same for now.",
  
  "reasoning": "By moving node_4 closer horizontally to node_3 (e.g. from x=2.3 to ~2.5) and increasing y slightly (e.g. from 3.5 to ~3.7), member_6 length increases reducing compressive stress. This also helps redistribute forces in members 2 and 3. This should reduce max stress below 9.0. Mass remains stable as member lengths change slightly. Avoid changing areas or adding members to keep design simple and stable.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "New node_4: (2.5, 3.7). Member lengths recalculated approximately. Member_6 length increases from sqrt((2.5-2)^2 + (3.7-0)^2) ~3.77m vs previous ~3.72m. Stress reduced by ~5-10%. Other members slightly affected but within limits.",
  
  "calculation": "Member_6 length ~3.77m, area_id=2 (0.782). Mass ~3.77*0.782=2.95 (slightly up from 2.75). Total mass ~21.9 still <30. Max stress expected below 9.0. Other members unchanged. Node_4 movement small but improves stress distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved to (2.5, 3.7) to reduce max compressive stress on member_6. Areas unchanged. Constraints met. Further improvements likely marginal. Continue optimization if needed.",
