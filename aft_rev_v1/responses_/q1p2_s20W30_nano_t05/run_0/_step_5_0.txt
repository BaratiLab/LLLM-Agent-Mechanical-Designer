  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while maintaining constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress ~9.12 < 20, total mass ~22.1 < 30, so constraints met. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_4 moved slightly in last step.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_6 (-9.12), a tension member from node_3 to node_4. Member_3 also stressed (7.27). Mass is well below limit. Current configuration has node_4 at (2.5, 3.7). Moving node_4 affects member lengths and stress distribution in members 2, 3, and 6. Slight upward or lateral shift of node_4 may reduce stress in member_6 by changing geometry and force path.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_6 length and angle influence stress. Node_4 too high increases stress in member_6. Too low reduces load transfer efficiency. Current node_4 at (2.5,3.7) is a balance but stress on member_6 still near 9.1. Try lowering node_4 slightly and shifting right to reduce tension in member_6 and compressive stress in member_3.",

  "reasoning": "By moving node_4 slightly lower and right, we can reduce member_6 length and tension, and balance forces better in the triangle formed by nodes 1, 2, and 4. This should reduce max stress. Keep member areas same as current for minimal mass increase. Node_3 fixed at (2,0), node_1 and node_2 fixed for supports and loads. No member changes; only node_4 position adjusted.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Try node_4 at approx (2.7,3.3) from (2.5,3.7). This reduces vertical height, slightly increases horizontal distance from node_2, changing force angles. Expect member_6 stress to reduce below 9.12, member_3 stress to reduce. Mass roughly same as member lengths similar. Areas kept same: member_1 (area 1), members_2,3,6 (area 2), members_4,5 (area 3).",

  "calculation": "Node_4 moved to (2.7, 3.3). Member lengths recalculated: member_6 length reduced, member_3 length slightly increased. Estimated max stress reduces to ~8.5. Total mass remains ~22.1. Constraints satisfied. Stress and mass constraints met with margin.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New node_4 position (2.7,3.3) improves stress distribution, reduces max stress, maintains mass <30, no changes to load/support nodes, no duplicate nodes or members, areas unchanged. Ready for next iteration or stop if no further improvement.",
