  "preamble": "Current design meets constraints with low stress and acceptable mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max stress Â±20, max mass 30. Current max stress ~9.13, mass ~21.92. Load on node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 position adjusted in iterations to optimize stress.",
  
  "analysis": "Stress is well below limits, mass is under max. Minor oscillations in node_4 vertical position show little improvement. Member areas and connectivity remain consistent. Largest stress is compressive on member_6 but within limits.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further node_4 moves yield negligible stress reduction. Member areas optimized for load paths. No violations of constraints observed. Structure stable and efficient.",
  
  "reasoning": "Given constraints and history, node_4 at (2.5,3.6) balances load distribution well. Member areas chosen reflect stress magnitude and length. Further optimization unlikely to reduce max stress significantly without increasing mass or violating constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress max ~9.13 <20, mass ~21.92 <30. Member lengths and areas consistent with stress demands. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_4 movable only, current placement optimal.",
  
  "calculation": "Member stresses and masses checked. No member exceeds stress limits. Total mass well below max. Adjusting node_4 position further risks increasing stress or mass. Current design is optimal within given constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints satisfied. Max stress minimized given configuration. No duplicate nodes or members. Node positions precise. Load/support nodes unchanged. Design ready to stop optimization.",
