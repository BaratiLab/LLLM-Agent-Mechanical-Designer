Node_4 moved iteratively to balance stress. Members use areas {1,2,3} mostly. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_6 (-9.24), compressive. Member_3 and member_2 also have notable tensile stresses (~7.7 and 4.3). Member_4 has moderate compression (-5.9). Mass is well below limit. Node_4 moved down from previous iterations to reduce stress but max stress slightly increased from iteration 4 to 5. This suggests node_4 position near (2.7,3.3) may not be optimal. Moving node_4 slightly upward and left may reduce member_6 stress by changing geometry and force distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider shifting node_4 slightly up (3.4-3.6) and left (2.4-2.6). This may reduce member_6 compression and member_3 tension. Member areas seem reasonable; no change needed. Member_1 area smallest (1), members 2 and 3 area 2, members 4 and 5 area 3, member 6 area 2. This distribution balances mass and stress well.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_6 carries highest compressive stress; reducing its length or changing angle may reduce stress. Increasing height of node_4 increases triangle area, potentially reducing forces in members. Moving node_4 left reduces length of member_2 and member_3, slightly shifting force distribution. Keep node_3 fixed at (2,0), supports fixed. Adjust node_4 to (2.5, 3.6) as a compromise.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths with new node_4: member_2: dist(node_2 to node_4), member_3: dist(node_4 to node_1), member_6: dist(node_3 to node_4). Expect member_6 length increase reduces compressive stress. Areas remain as iteration 5.",\n  \n  "calculation": "node_4 new coords: (2.5, 3.6). Lengths: member_2 = sqrt((6-2.5)^2 + (0-3.6)^2) = sqrt(12.25 + 12.96) = sqrt(25.21) ~5.02. member_3 = sqrt((2.5-0)^2 + (3.6-0)^2) = sqrt(6.25 + 12.96) = sqrt(19.21) ~4.38. member_6 = sqrt((2-2.5)^2 + (0-3.6)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 12.96) = sqrt(13.21) ~3.63 (longer than before ~3.3). Longer member_6 reduces stress for same force. Mass recalculated with same areas: member_2 mass ~ length*area_factor(0.782)=5.02*0.782=3.93, member_3=4.38*0.782=3.43, member_6=3.63*0.782=2.84, total mass changes slightly but remains <30.
