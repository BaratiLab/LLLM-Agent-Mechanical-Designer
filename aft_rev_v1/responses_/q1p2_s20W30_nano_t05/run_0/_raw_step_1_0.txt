Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Current max stress 29.05 > 20 allowed. Mass 25.14 < 30 allowed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current max stress exceeds limit on member_3 (node_4-node_1) with area 0.195 (area_id \'1\'). Member_3 is short and highly stressed. Current structure has a triangle with node_4 at (2,3). Members around node_4 carry load but member_3 is overloaded. Need to reduce stress by increasing area or redistributing load. Increasing area on member_3 will increase mass slightly but total mass is below limit. Alternatively, reposition node_4 higher and add a diagonal member to better distribute forces. Also, member_1 (node_1-node_2) area 0.782 might be reduced to save mass. Member_4,5,6 have larger areas (1.759) but low stress, can reduce areas there. Overall, redesign with node_4 moved higher and adding a diagonal member from node_2 to node_4 to reduce stress on member_3.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_4 from (2,3) to (3.0,4.5) to increase vertical height, improving load path. Add member from node_2 to node_4 with area 0.782. Reduce member_3 area to 0.782 or 0.195 to keep stress within limits. Reduce member_4 and member_6 areas to 0.782 from 1.759. Reduce member_1 area to 0.195 from 0.782. Check total mass and max stress. Keep members connecting load and supports intact.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Move node_4 to (3.0, 4.5).
