  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while keeping constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress is 9.18 < 20, mass 22.73 < 30. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_4 moved from (3.0,4.5) to (2.7,4.0) improved stress from 9.26 to 9.18. Need to further reduce max stress by better node_4 placement.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_6 (-9.18). Members connected to node_4 have high stresses (members 2,3,6). Node_4 controls truss height and angles. Moving node_4 affects force distribution. Current node_4 at (2.7,4.0) reduced stress from previous (3.0,4.5). Further slight lowering and shifting node_4 towards node_3 might reduce stress in member_6 and member_3. Members 2 and 3 with area 2 can be kept or adjusted if needed. Mass is well below limit, so area can be increased if needed to reduce stress, but better to optimize geometry first.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on node_4 position: try lowering y and shifting x closer to node_3 (x=2.0) to reduce tension in member_6 and compression in member_3. Keep node_3 fixed at (2.0,0.0). Member areas mostly area_id 2 and 3 are reasonable.",
  
  "reasoning": "Since node_3 is fixed at (2.0,0.0), moving node_4 closer horizontally to node_3 (x ~ 2.3) and slightly lower y (~3.5) may reduce member_6 length and stress. This will also affect members 2 and 3. Member_1 and 5 are on bottom chord, less stressed. Member_4 and 5 have area 3, sufficient. Member_1 area 1 is smallest, acceptable. Member_2 and 3 area 2 may be kept or increased if stress remains high. But since mass is low, slight area increase is possible if needed. First try geometry optimization.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Estimate member lengths and angles for node_4 at (2.3,3.5): member_6 length ~ sqrt((2.0-2.3)^2 + (0-3.5)^2) ~ 3.5, less than current ~4.12. Shorter member length reduces stress for same force. Member_3 length ~ sqrt((2.3-0)^2 + (3.5-0)^2) ~ 4.2, slightly less than current 4.72. Member_2 length ~ sqrt((6-2.3)^2 + (0-3.5)^2) ~ 4.5, slightly less than current 4.34. Overall, shorter members or better force angles can reduce stress.",
  
  "calculation": "Adjust node_4 to (2.3, 3.5). Keep member areas same: member_1:1, member_2:2, member_3:2, member_4:3, member_5:3, member_6:2. Total mass estimated to remain under 23. Max stress expected to reduce below 9.0 due to better geometry. Confirm no constraint violation.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 at (2.3,3.5) expected to reduce max stress below 9.0, total mass ~22-23, all constraints met. No duplicate nodes or members. Load and supports fixed. Areas from allowed set. Proceed with this design for next iteration.",
