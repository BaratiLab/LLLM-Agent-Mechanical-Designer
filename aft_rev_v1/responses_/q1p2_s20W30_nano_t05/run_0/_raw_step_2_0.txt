Adjusting node_4 vertical and horizontal position can redistribute forces and reduce stress. Current node_4 at (3.0,4.5) is higher than previous (2.0,3.0), which reduced stress from 29 to 9.26. Further fine tuning may reduce stress more. Members have area ids 1,2,3 mostly; mass is under limit. Member_6 area is 2 (0.782) which is moderate. Member lengths and geometry affect stress and mass. Need to keep truss closed and stable, no node duplication, no change of load/support nodes. Node_4 can be moved within reasonable range near current position to improve stress distribution.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try lowering node_4 slightly to reduce member_6 stress, or shift horizontally to balance forces. Avoid increasing mass by large length increase. Keep member_2,3,6 area 2 for moderate stiffness, member_4,5 area 3 for support. Member_1 area 1 is minimal. Check member lengths after node_4 move for mass impact.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_6 stress is highest compressive. Decreasing length or changing angle of member_6 can reduce stress. Lowering node_4 reduces length of member_6, possibly reducing stress. Shifting node_4 horizontally closer to node_3 reduces member_6 length but may increase stress in member_2 or 3. Optimal balance needed. Since node_4 moved from (2,3) to (3,4.5) improved stress drastically, try intermediate position around (2.7,4.0).",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and estimate mass for node_4 at (2.7,4.0). Member lengths: m2 (node_2-node_4), m3 (node_4-node_1), m6 (node_3-node_4). Mass = sum(length * area). Stress expected to reduce as member_6 length reduces from 5.0 approx to ~4.3. Keep areas same.
