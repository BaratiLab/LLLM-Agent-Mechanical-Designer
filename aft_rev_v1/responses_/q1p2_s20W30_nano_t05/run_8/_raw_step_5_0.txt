Constraints on stresses Â±20 and mass < 30 are satisfied. Load at node_3, supports at node_1(pinned) and node_2(roller). Nodes for load/support fixed. Node_4 and node_5 positions can be adjusted.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_5 (-10.18 compressive). Member_5 connects node_3(2.0,0.0) and node_4(2.1,3.3). Slightly lowering node_4 or shifting it horizontally closer to node_3 could reduce compressive stress on member_5. Node_5 is close to node_4 and node_3, possibly causing some stress concentration. The mass is moderate (~24.67). Member areas are mostly small to medium (areas 1,2,3).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try moving node_4 slightly down and towards node_3 to reduce member_5 compression. Slightly adjust node_5 to maintain closed truss and avoid stress concentration. Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Member areas seem reasonable; no need to change areas now.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_5 experiences highest compressive stress likely due to geometry and load path. By moving node_4 closer to node_3 horizontally and slightly lower vertically, member_5 length shortens and load path improves, potentially reducing stress. Node_5 position affects members 6,7,8,9; minor adjustment could balance forces. Maintaining closed truss is critical, so all members remain connected. Areas chosen are moderate and mass is under limit, so focus on geometry refinement.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_4: (2.1, 3.3). Move to approx (2.05, 3.1). Node_5: currently (1.5,3.5), move slightly towards node_4 to (1.55,3.4). This maintains closure and may reduce stress in member_5 and others. Member areas unchanged.",\n  \n  "calculation": "New node_4: (2.05, 3.1) length member_5 (node_3-node_4) reduces from ~3.3 to ~3.1, reducing compressive stress. Node_5: (1.55,3.4) keeps close to node_4 and node_3, preserving triangulation. Member lengths and areas roughly same, so mass ~24.5-25. Max stress estimated to reduce to ~9.5-10.0 from 10.18. Constraints remain satisfied.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met: max stress < 20, mass < 30. Geometry refined to reduce max stress. Nodes for load/support fixed.
