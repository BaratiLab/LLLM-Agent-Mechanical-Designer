  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 and node_5 positions to reduce max stress below 10 and minimize total mass within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress ~10.1 within Â±20 limit; total mass 25.55 < 30 max. Load/support nodes fixed. Members mostly area 2 or 3. Member_5 and member_9 with area 1 have highest stress magnitudes. Need to reduce stress peaks by geometry adjustment.",
  
  "analysis": "Max compressive stress at member_5 (-10.1) and tensile stresses moderate. Geometry shows node_4 and node_5 slightly raised from previous iteration. Mass increased slightly. Load at node_3 downward-left. Current layout is stable but stress concentration at member_5 and member_9 suggests local geometry or force path can be improved by repositioning node_4 and node_5.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Lower node_5 y-coordinate slightly to reduce length and stress in members connected to it, especially member_5 and member_9. Slightly shift node_4 horizontally to balance force paths and reduce stress in member_5. Keep node_3 x=2 fixed, node_1 and node_2 fixed. Member areas appear reasonable, no change recommended now.",
  
  "reasoning": "Stress concentration in member_5 indicates force transfer inefficiency or geometry mismatch. By lowering node_5 y-coordinate, reduce tension in members connected to it. Slight horizontal shift of node_4 towards node_3 reduces bending effect and redistributes stresses. These small adjustments can reduce max stress and possibly mass by shortening members or enabling smaller cross sections later.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_4 at (2.2,3.5), node_5 at (1.5,3.8). Try node_4 to (2.1,3.3), node_5 to (1.5,3.5). Keep other nodes fixed. Check member lengths and estimate stress reduction. Member_5 length reduces, member_9 length reduces. Areas remain unchanged.",
  
  "calculation": "New lengths: member_5 (node_3 to node_4) length reduces from ~3.5 to ~3.3; member_9 (node_4 to node_5) length reduces from ~0.45 to ~0.3. Mass reduces slightly. Stress expected to reduce proportionally with length and better force distribution. Total mass estimated ~25.0, max stress expected <10.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Positions updated as per above; members unchanged. Constraints satisfied. Next iteration can refine if needed, but stress near 10 is close to optimal given constraints and fixed load/support nodes.",
