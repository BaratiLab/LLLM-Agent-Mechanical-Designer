  "preamble": "Optimize a closed 2D truss with given nodes, loads, supports; minimize stress within ±20, mass ≤30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given 3 nodes: node_1(0,0, pinned), node_2(6,0, roller), node_3(2,0, load -10 at -45°). Need closed truss: all nodes connected. Max stress ±20, mass ≤30. Areas discrete from 0 to 10 with given values. Keep nodes fixed, optimize members and areas.",
  
  "analysis": "Nodes lie on x-axis; node_3 loaded with downward-left force. To form closed truss, must connect nodes forming at least a triangle. Current nodes colinear, so add one new node off x-axis to form triangle. Add node_4 above node_3 to create a stable triangular geometry. Connect members to form closed loop: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_4. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) provide boundary conditions.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) (above node_3) to form triangle. Members: (1-3), (3-2), (1-4), (4-2), (3-4). Estimate lengths, assign areas to keep stress ≤20 and mass ≤30. Use truss equilibrium and simple axial stress = force / area assumptions. Use minimum areas for low stress members; larger for high force paths.",
  
  "reasoning": "Load at node_3 is -10 at -45°, components Fx = -10*cos45= -7.07, Fy = -10*sin45= -7.07. Members around node_3 take this load. Area selection balances stress and mass. Use smaller areas for longer members under low load to reduce mass. For compressive/tensile stress, assume axial force = load component / member length. Mass = sum(length × area). Use area ids from given set. Member lengths via Euclidean distance. Stress = axial force / area. Keep stress ≤20 in magnitude.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: 1-3=2.0, 3-2=4.0, 1-4=3.0, 4-2=4.472, 3-4=3.0. Assign areas: 1-3: 2 (0.782), 3-2: 3 (1.759), 1-4: 1 (0.195), 4-2: 1 (0.195), 3-4: 2 (0.782).
