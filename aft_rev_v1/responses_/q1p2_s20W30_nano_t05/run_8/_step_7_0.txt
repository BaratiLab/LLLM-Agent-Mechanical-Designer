  "preamble": "Current truss design meets constraints with minimized stress and mass within limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 5.48 < 20 allowed. Total mass 26.02 < 30 max. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Nodes for load/support fixed; only nodes 4 and 5 adjustable. Area sizes chosen mostly area_id '2' for balance.",
  
  "analysis": "Stress is well below limits, mass is under max. Node_4 and node_5 are positioned to balance load and reduce stress. Members with high stress have moderate areas. Member_1 with highest compressive stress uses area 3 (1.759) for strength. No member exceeds stress bounds. The structure is stable and closed with no duplicates.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further node adjustments show diminishing returns in stress reduction. Current layout has balanced force flow and minimal stress concentrations. Mass is slightly high but within limit, reducing areas further risks increasing stress.",
  
  "reasoning": "Given the low max stress and safety margin, and mass below max, further optimization would likely reduce mass but increase stress or vice versa. Node_4 and node_5 positions are optimized to distribute loads effectively. Areas are chosen to balance mass and stress. No violation of constraints found. Optimization should stop.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member stresses and masses checked; all within limits. Node_4 at (1.9,3.0) and node_5 at (1.6,3.5) provide good geometry for load transfer. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. No new members needed. Areas mostly area_id '2' (0.782) with critical member_1 area_id '3' (1.759).",
  
  "calculation": "Max stress 5.48 < 20. Total mass 26.02 < 30. Member stresses range from -5.48 to +3.57. Member masses sum to 26.02. No constraint violation. Node moves in previous iterations improved stress from ~29 to ~5.5. Further moves yield no significant improvement.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints satisfied, no duplicates, load/support nodes fixed, stress and mass optimized, design stable and closed. Stop optimization.",
