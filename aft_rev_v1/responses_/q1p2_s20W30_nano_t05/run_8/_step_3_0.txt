  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 and node_5 positions to reduce max stress under 10.14 and total mass under 30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress currently 10.14 < 20, total mass 24.54 < 30. Load at node_3 and supports fixed. Nodes 4 and 5 movable. Member areas mostly 1-3. Stress mostly within limits but member_5 at -10.14 is critical.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design satisfies constraints but max stress is mostly from member_5 (-10.14). Members 1 and 8 also have notable compressive stresses. Node_4 and node_5 positions affect geometry and force distribution. Increasing vertical separation between node_4 and node_5 can reduce compressive stress in member_5. Slight repositioning to balance force paths and reduce stress concentration is advisable.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_5 connects node_3 and node_4; its compression can be reduced by increasing vertical distance node_4 above node_3 and node_5 further above node_4. Adjust node_4 from (2.2,3.2) to ~ (2.2,3.5) and node_5 from (1.5,3.5) to ~ (1.5,3.8). Keep load/support nodes fixed. Recalculate member lengths and mass with same areas to check mass and stress.",
  
  "reasoning": "Increasing node_4 y-coordinate increases member_3 and member_4 lengths slightly but reduces compression in member_5 by changing angle and force distribution. Similarly, raising node_5 increases tension members length but should be minor mass increase. Areas remain as before to avoid mass increase. This geometric adjustment aims to lower max compressive stress from -10.14 to below 9.5, improving margin and stability.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculation: length = sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2). Mass = length * area_factor. Keep area factors same to isolate geometric effect. Check total mass after node moves. Estimate stress reduction based on increased vertical spacing and force path redistribution.",
  
  "calculation": "Node_4 from (2.2,3.2) to (2.2,3.5) increases member_3 length from ~3.7 to ~4.0, member_4 from ~4.1 to ~4.3. Node_5 from (1.5,3.5) to (1.5,3.8) increases members 6,7,9 lengths by ~0.3 units. Total mass estimated to increase by about 0.5-0.7 but remain < 30. Expected max stress reduction by ~10-15% based on improved geometry and force distribution. No member area changes to avoid mass increase.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New node positions: node_4 (2.2, 3.5), node_5 (1.5, 3.8). Member areas unchanged. Mass remains under 30. Max stress expected under 9.5. Constraints met. Continue optimization as stress can be further reduced.",
