  "preamble": "Optimize current 2D truss to reduce max stress while staying within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress ~10, total mass ~24.18 under limits. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 and node_5 moved slightly to reduce stress.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress in member_5 (-10.01) is the highest magnitude stress, close to half the allowable limit Â±20. Mass is well below max 30. Members with area_id '1' (0.195) and '2' (0.782) dominate. Node_4 and node_5 positions slightly lowered compared to previous steps, reducing stress slightly. Load and support nodes fixed as per instructions. Stress distribution shows compressive and tensile forces balanced but member_5 still critical.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing stress in member_5. Possibly adjusting node_4 and node_5 positions to optimize force paths. Consider slightly increasing area of member_5 from '1' to '2' if mass allows, or reposition nodes to reduce force in this member. Keep mass under 30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_5 connects node_3 (load) to node_4; high compressive stress suggests force path concentration there. Moving node_4 slightly closer to node_3 vertically or horizontally may reduce member_5 stress. Similarly, node_5 can be repositioned to redistribute forces in members 8 and 9. Increasing area of member_5 from '1' (0.195) to '2' (0.782) would increase mass by ~0.4-0.5 but reduce stress, possibly beneficial. Current members with area '3' and '2' are balanced to keep mass low. Slight repositioning of node_4 and node_5 within small range is allowed and may improve stress distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculations needed for mass estimate. Member_5 length ~distance(node_3,node_4). Current mass of member_5 ~0.6, increasing area from 1 to 2 would roughly quadruple mass (area ratio 0.782/0.195=4). That would add about 1.5 mass units, total mass ~25.7 still below 30. So increasing area of member_5 is plausible. Reposition node_4 slightly closer to node_3 horizontally (reduce x from 2.05 to ~1.9) and vertically (~3.1 to 3.0) to reduce member_5 length and stress. Node_5 can be adjusted similarly to balance members 8 and 9 stresses.",
  
  "calculation": "Adjust node_4 from (2.05,3.1) to (1.9,3.0). Adjust node_5 from (1.55,3.4) to (1.6,3.5). Change member_5 area from '1' to '2'. Recalculate member lengths and masses: member_5 length ~ sqrt((2.0-1.9)^2 + (0.0-3.0)^2) = ~3.004, mass = length*area = 3.004*0.782=2.35 (previously ~0.6). Increase total mass ~24.18 - 0.6 + 2.35 = ~25.93 < 30. Expected stress in member_5 reduced due to shorter length and larger area. Other members kept same areas to keep mass low. Positions of load and support nodes fixed as required.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes or members. Node positions precise floats. Mass under 30. Max stress expected <10 with increased area and repositioning. Load and supports fixed. Structure remains closed and stable. Optimization can continue further if needed but improvements are marginal. Recommend next iteration to verify FEM results.",
