Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current design too heavy (31.3) and overstressed (128.5).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high compressive stress in member_5 (node_5-node_1) and member_1 (node_1-node_4). Mass exceeds limit slightly. Members near load and support carry excessive load. Area selections are mid-range (2-3). Node_7 added to reduce stress but ineffective. Need to reduce member areas and improve load path.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Strategy: Reduce member cross-sections where stress is low, increase only critical members but capped at area 3 or below. Add a vertical node above load node_3 for direct load transfer. Simplify topology to reduce redundant members. Use truss geometry with triangular bracing for stiffness and stress distribution.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_6 above node_3 at (2.0, 2.5). Connect node_6 to node_1, node_2, node_3, and node_4 forming triangles. Remove node_7 to simplify. Use areas mostly 2 or 3 to limit mass and stress. Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_6, node_6-node_1, node_6-node_2, node_6-node_4, node_3-node_1, node_3-node_2, node_5 removed to simplify.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_6 vertically above load node_3 creates direct load path to supports via shorter members, reducing stress. Triangular bracing improves stability. Removing node_5 and node_7 reduces mass and complexity. Using moderate area sizes balances stress and mass. Avoid large areas that increase mass beyond limit. Maintain pinned and roller supports fixed.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths estimated: node_1-node_4 ~3.6, node_4-node_2 ~3.0, node_3-node_6 ~2.5, node_6-node_1 ~3.0, node_6-node_2 ~4.0, node_6-node_4 ~1.0, node_3-node_1 ~2.0, node_3-node_2 ~4.0.

Stress estimated from load distribution: max stress expected under ±20.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Mass approx = sum(length × area) with areas 2 or 3. For example, member_1 (node_1-node_4) length ~3.6 × area 3 = 5.3, member_2 (node_4-node_2) length ~3.0 × area 2 = 6.2, etc. Total mass estimated ~28.5.
