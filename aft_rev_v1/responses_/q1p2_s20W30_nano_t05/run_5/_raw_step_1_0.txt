Total mass 16.89 < 30. Node_3 loaded, nodes_1,2 supported. Only node_4 movable. Areas currently mostly 2 or 3 (0.782 and 1.759).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_4 (node_3-node_1) has highest compressive stress (-15.07). To reduce stress, adjust node_4 position to better distribute load. Increasing node_4 height may reduce forces in horizontal members. Also, consider reducing area of member_4 to lower mass and stress concentration, increasing areas in tension members to balance. Must maintain closed truss with 5 members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Moving node_4 vertically upward slightly and shifting horizontally near node_3 may reduce compressive stress in member_4. Area changes: reduce member_4 area to \'1\' (0.195), increase member_3 area to \'4\' (3.128) to carry more load in tension. Keep other areas same or slightly adjusted.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Shifting node_4 from (3.0, 3.0) to approx (3.2, 3.5) increases vertical component of forces in members connected to node_4, reduces bending moment on member_4. Reducing member_4 area reduces stress concentration and mass. Increasing member_3 area redistributes tension forces. Member_1 and member_2 areas kept moderate to maintain stability. Member_5 area kept same to maintain load path. This should reduce max stress below current 15.07 and keep mass <30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4: (3.2, 3.5); member_4 area_id \'1\' (0.195); member_3 area_id \'4\' (3.128); member_1 and member_2 area_id \'2\' (0.782); member_5 area_id \'2\' (0.782). Calculate approximate member lengths and estimate mass: member_4 length ~distance(node_3-node_1)=2.0, mass ~2*0.195=0.39 (down from 1.564). Member_3 length ~distance(node_4-node_3)=sqrt((3.2-2)^2 + (3.5-0)^2) ~3.68, mass ~3.68*3.128=11.5 (up from 5.56). Total mass roughly 3.3+3.3+11.5+0.39+... ~19-20 < 30, acceptable.
