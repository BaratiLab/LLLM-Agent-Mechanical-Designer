  "preamble": "Optimized closed truss with minimized stress under constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current design satisfies stress and mass limits with max stress 14.03 < 20 and mass 27.6 < 30.",
  "analysis": "The current 6-node truss with 8 members uses areas mostly 2 and 3, balancing mass and stress. Max stress at member_7 (-14.03) is well within ±20 limit. Mass is under 30. Load and support nodes fixed; intermediate node_6 positioned at (2.0, 2.5) provides good force distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further node moves may reduce stress slightly but risk increasing mass or violating constraints. History shows attempts to add nodes or move intermediate nodes increased max stress or mass beyond limits.",
  "reasoning": "The structure is statically determinate and well-braced with triangular substructures. Member areas are moderate, avoiding overstressing or excess mass. Node_6 is optimally placed to distribute load from node_3 (-10N at -45°). No member overstressed beyond ±20. Mass below 30. Further optimization unlikely to yield meaningful stress reduction without constraint violation.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member stresses range -14.03 to +0.93, all within ±20. Total mass 27.6 < 30. Node_3 and support nodes fixed. Intermediate node_6 position (2.0, 2.5) balances geometry. Areas chosen from allowed set {2,3} ensure moderate cross-sections. No duplicate nodes or members.",
  "calculation": "Verified member lengths and areas yield total mass 27.6157. Max stress is 14.03 < 20. No constraint violations. Load applied at node_3 and supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller) fixed. Stress distribution balanced by node_6 placement and member sizing.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints satisfied, stress minimized effectively. No further node repositioning or area changes recommended due to risk of stress increase or mass overrun. Stop optimization.",
