Current max stress 203 exceeds limit, mass 27.4 close to limit. Load at node_3 (-10, -45°). Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Existing nodes mostly fixed except internal nodes can be adjusted. Areas must be from given discrete set.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high stresses mainly in members connected to node_7 and node_5. Member_12 has stress -203, member_5 has 145, member_10 -90, well beyond ±20 limit. Mass is near max but stress failure is critical. The structure is complex with 7 nodes and 12 members. Overstressed members have relatively small cross-sections (area 2 or 1). Increasing cross-section would increase mass beyond limit. Need to reduce internal forces by geometry and connectivity changes. Node_7 placement at (2.0, 2.0) causes stress concentration. Load at node_3 induces large tensile and compressive forces in members connected to it. Simplifying truss and redistributing forces is needed.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Strategy: Remove node_7 to reduce complexity and stress concentration. Adjust node_5 and node_6 positions to better triangulate load path. Use members connecting load node_3 directly to supports and key internal nodes. Increase some member areas moderately but keep total mass ≤30. Avoid long slender members with small areas under high load. Aim for triangular stable geometry with fewer members to reduce stress peaks.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_7. Keep nodes 1,2,3 fixed. Place node_4 at (3.0, 3.5), node_5 at (2.3, 3.0), node_6 at (3.7, 4.2). Members: node_1-node_4 (area 3), node_4-node_2 (area 3), node_3-node_5 (area 3), node_5-node_4 (area 2), node_5-node_1 (area 2), node_3-node_2 (area 2), node_6-node_4 (area 1), node_6-node_5 (area 1). This layout simplifies load path, reduces stress concentration, and keeps mass moderate.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing node_7 eliminates highly stressed members (member_10, 11, 12). Positioning node_4 higher and node_5 closer to load node_3 reduces bending moments. Members connecting load node_3 directly to supports and internal nodes distribute load more evenly. Using moderate areas (2 or 3) balances strength and mass. Small members to node_6 provide stability without large mass. Triangular formations ensure structural stability and efficient load transfer.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths and estimate masses: node_1-node_4 ~4.3m, area 3 (1.759), mass ~7.55; node_4-node_2 ~3.2m, area 3, mass ~5.6; node_3-node_5 ~3.0m, area 3, mass ~5.3; node_5-node_4 ~1.2m, area 2 (0.782), mass ~0.94; node_5-node_1 ~3.35m, area 2, mass ~2.62; node_3-node_2 4.0m, area 2, mass ~3.13; node_6-node_4 ~1.0m, area 1 (0.195), mass ~0.195; node_6-node_5 ~1.5m, area 1, mass ~0.29. Total mass ~25.2 < 30 limit. Expected max stress reduced by geometry and area increase. Members with high forces have larger areas.

Load at node_3 (-10 N at -45°) resolved by multiple members in tension/compression. Supports pinned and roller provide statically determinate reactions. Triangular geometry ensures no large bending moments. No overlapping members or nodes. Areas chosen from allowed set.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes or members.
