Current max stress 36.26 > 20, mass 20.36 < 30. Need to reduce max stress by redistributing load and adjusting topology and areas.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high stress on member_6 (node_3-node_1) and member_5 (node_5-node_1). Members with large cross sections near node_1 cause stress concentration. Additional node_5 added but stress still high. Member areas large in some members leading to mass but stress still high, indicating inefficient load path. Need to improve load path from node_3 to supports by adding vertical and diagonal members to better distribute forces and reduce stress peaks.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding a new node higher above node_3 to form a truss with shorter members and better force distribution. Remove redundant members causing stress concentration. Use smaller areas where stress is low to save mass. Maintain existing nodes for load/support. Use area sizes that balance stress and mass.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node (node_6) above node_3 at (2.0,4.0). Connect node_6 to node_4 and node_5 to form a triangular truss above. Remove member_6 (node_3-node_1) to reduce high stress. Connect node_3 to node_5 and node_3 to node_4 with moderate areas. Adjust member areas to reduce max stress below 20 and total mass below 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_6 at (2.0,4.0) creates a vertical load path and distributes forces through multiple members. Removing member_6 eliminates the highest stressed member. Triangular topology improves stiffness and reduces bending. Using smaller areas on low stress members reduces mass. Cross-check stress with member lengths and areas. Ensure no duplicate nodes or members. Keep support and load nodes fixed.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_3-node_5 ~2.5, node_5-node_1 ~2.5, node_5-node_4 ~1.8, node_4-node_2 ~2.8, node_1-node_4 ~3.8, node_6-node_4 ~1.2, node_6-node_5 ~2.0. Assign areas from {0:1,1:0.195,2:0.782,3:1.759,...}. Use area 2 or 3 for main load path members, area 1 for secondary. Estimate stresses by load path and member stiffness proportional to area*length.
