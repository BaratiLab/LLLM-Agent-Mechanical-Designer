Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Current max stress 35.17 > 20 limit; mass 11.9 < 30 limit. Need stress reduction.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high tensile stress (-35.17) in member_5 (node_3-node_1) and compressive stress (20.17) in member_4 (node_5-node_4). Member_5 area too small for load. Members mostly low area (1 or 2). Node_5 is at (2.0, 3.8) causing long slender members with high stress. Load at node_3 is pulling diagonally down-left, inducing tension in member_5 and compression in member_4. Current layout lacks adequate triangulation and stiffness near load node_3.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, increase cross-sectional areas in critical members or add members to better distribute forces. Moving node_5 upward and left closer to node_3 may reduce member lengths and stresses. Adding member between node_5 and node_2 can help triangulate. Avoid increasing mass excessively by using moderate areas (1-3).",\n  \n  "proposal": "Maintain nodes_1,2,3 fixed. Adjust node_4 slightly left and down to (3.5, 3.0) for better force path. Move node_5 closer to node_3 at (2.5, 2.5). Add member between node_5 and node_2 to improve triangulation. Increase areas on critical members: node_3-node_1, node_5-node_4, node_1-node_4 to area_id \'3\' (1.759) or \'4\' (3.128). Use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for others to control mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Shortening members and adding triangulation reduces bending and stress concentrations. Increasing area on members with highest stress reduces stress. Node_5 reposition reduces member length and stress. Additional member node_5-node_2 shares load path. Areas chosen balance stress and mass constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths recalculated with new node positions. Areas assigned to keep mass below 30. Expected max stress below 20 due to better load distribution and member sizing.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Lengths approx: node_1-node_4 ~4.27m, node_4-node_2 ~2.69m, node_3-node_5 ~2.12m, node_5-node_4 ~1.58m, node_3-node_1 ~2.69m, node_3-node_2 ~4.0m, node_5-node_2 ~2.12m.
