Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current max stress 51.5 and mass 23.5 exceed stress limit.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high compressive stress on member_6 (node_3-node_1) at -51.5, exceeding ±20 limit. Mass is below max. Members with area 1 or 2 mostly. Load is at node_3 near bottom chord, causing high stress in bottom chord member_6. Top nodes (node_4, 5, 6) added but not effective in reducing stress. Need to redistribute forces, add bracing to reduce long compressive member stress and optimize areas.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce stress in bottom chord members by adding vertical and diagonal members to distribute load. Increase area in critical compression members to reduce stress. Possibly add intermediate node above node_3 to form a truss triangle for load path. Keep mass under 30 by using smaller areas where possible.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node above node_3 at (2.0, 2.0) to form a vertical member and connect it with diagonals to node_4 and node_5. Remove or reduce area of highly stressed member_6, replace with two members via new node. Assign areas to keep stresses within ±20 and mass <30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Introducing a vertical node above node_3 creates a truss panel that reduces long compression in bottom chord by splitting it into shorter members. Diagonal members from new node to node_4 and node_5 provide load path to supports. This reduces buckling risk and stress magnitude. Area selection balances mass and strength. Existing load and support nodes fixed, new node added to improve geometry. Avoid duplicate members.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculations: node_3 to new_node: 2.0m vertical; new_node to node_4 (~1.8m diagonal); new_node to node_5 (~0.7m diagonal). Assign moderate areas (2 or 3) to these to reduce stress. Remove member_6 or reduce its area to minimum (1) or remove if redundant. Check total mass sum and max stress estimate.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Estimate mass: members lengths times area. Old member_6 (node_3-node_1) length 2.0m, area 1 (0.195) mass=0.39. New vertical member same length, area 2 (0.782) mass=1.56. Diagonals ~1.8m * area 2 mass=1.4 each, ~0.7m * area 2 mass=0.55. Total added ~3.5 mass, old member_6 removed 0.39, net +3.1 mass. Total mass ~26.6 < 30. Stress redistributed, expect max stress <20. Use areas 1-3 for members to control mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Check no duplicate nodes or members.
