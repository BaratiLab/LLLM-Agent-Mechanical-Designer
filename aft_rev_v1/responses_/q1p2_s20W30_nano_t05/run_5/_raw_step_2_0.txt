Max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current max stress 58.36 exceeds limit. Current mass 22.3 under limit but member_4 highly stressed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High compressive stress in member_4 (node_3-node_1) due to direct load transfer. Member_4 area is small (area_id=1 => 0.195) causing overstress. Members connecting load node to supports need reconfiguration and possibly adding nodes to better distribute forces and reduce stress concentration.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing area of member_4 alone increases mass. Adding a new node above node_3 can create a triangle to better carry load. Reassign member areas strategically to reduce max stress. Consider removing member_5 (node_3-node_2) or reducing its area if redundant.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add one node above node_3 at (2.0, 2.5). Connect node_3 to new node_5 and node_5 to node_4 and node_1. Keep existing supports and load nodes fixed. Remove member_5 (node_3-node_2). Assign areas to balance stress and mass: Use area_id=3 for main load paths, smaller areas for others.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 creates additional load path, reducing stress on member_4.
