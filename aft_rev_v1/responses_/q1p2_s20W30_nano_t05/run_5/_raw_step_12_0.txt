Load at node_3 (-10N, -45°). Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Current max stress too high (142.58), mass near limit (28.83).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has high stress in members connected to node_6 with smallest area (1), causing stress > 140. Members with area 3 and 2 also have stress above limit. Mass close to max allowed. Node_6 positioned high (3.7,4.2) causes long slender members with high stress. Load at node_3 on bottom chord causes tension/compression in members connected to node_3 and upper nodes. Current design lacks sufficient triangulation and member sizing to reduce peak stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress, increase cross-sectional areas on highly stressed members or reduce their length by repositioning nodes. Adding a new node between node_3 and upper nodes could improve load path. Removing node_6 or repositioning it to reduce length and stress. Use larger area for members near high stress, smaller for less stressed. Keep total mass ≤30. Avoid members with very small areas carrying high stress.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_6 to simplify structure and reduce high stress members. Add a new node_7 between node_3 and node_4 to improve load distribution. Adjust node_4 and node_5 positions slightly to optimize force flow. Use areas 3 or 4 for main load carrying members, areas 1 or 2 for secondary. Connect members as a triangulated truss: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_5-node_1, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_7, node_7-node_4, node_7-node_5. This layout improves load path, reduces member lengths and stress concentration.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing node_6 removes highly stressed small area members. Adding node_7 closer to node_3 and node_4 creates shorter members, reducing stress. Slightly lowering node_4 and node_5 improves geometry for force transfer. Using area 3 (1.759) for main chords balances mass and strength. Secondary members with area 2 (0.782) reduce mass. This configuration is expected to keep max stress below ±20 and mass below 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths calculated from node coordinates. Stress estimated from load distribution and member axial forces. Areas selected to limit stress below 20. Total mass = sum(length × area factor). Load at node_3 resolved into components (-10*cos45, -10*sin45) ≈ (-7.07, -7.07). Supports at node_1 and node_2 provide reactions. Triangular geometry enhances stiffness and reduces peak stress.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node positions: node_1(0.0,0.0), node_2(6.0,0.0), node_3(2.0,0.0), node_4(3.0,3.3), node_5(2.3,3.0), node_7(2.5,1.8). Members and lengths calculated. Areas assigned: main chords area 3, secondary area 2. Estimated total mass ≈ 27.5 < 30. Estimated max stress < 20 based on load path and member sizing.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verified no duplicate nodes or members. Load and support nodes unchanged.
