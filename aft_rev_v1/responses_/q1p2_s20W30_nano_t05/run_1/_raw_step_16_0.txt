Stress peaks on member_2 (node_7-node_4, area 1) and member_8 (node_4-node_3, area 1) with opposite signs near ±31. Member_4 (node_5-node_2) has zero stress but large mass (7.82). Members with large areas (3 and 4) contribute to mass but stress is low. Load path seems indirect with nodes 6 and 7 placed low, causing stress concentrations. Need to reduce stress by improving load path and redistributing forces, possibly by adding a node higher than node_4 to reduce bending and redistribute forces, and adjust member areas to reduce stress and mass. Keep load/support nodes fixed. Remove or reduce oversized members with low stress to save mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider a triangular truss with nodes at supports and load, plus a new node elevated above node_4 (2,2.2) to reduce bending. Connect load node_3 directly to this new node and supports to create direct load paths. Reduce areas of highly stressed members. Remove members with zero or negligible stress but high mass. Use moderate areas (1-3) to balance stress and mass. Keep node_7 for lateral stability but reposition to reduce stress.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node_8 above node_4 at (2.0, 3.0). Remove node_7 and node_6 to simplify. Connect members: node_1-node_8, node_2-node_8, node_3-node_8, node_4-node_8, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_3-node_5. Assign areas to reduce stress: larger areas on high-stress members, smaller on low-stress. Aim to keep mass <30 and max stress <20.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "A higher node_8 creates a more direct load path from node_3 (load) to supports, reducing bending moments and stress concentration. Removing nodes 6 and 7 reduces complexity and mass. Connecting node_3 to node_8 and node_4 shares load paths. Using moderate areas balances mass and strength. Member_4 (node_5-node_2) area reduced from 4 to 2 to save mass as it had zero stress. Member_3 (node_4-node_5) area 2 to carry moderate stress. Members directly carrying load have area 3 for safety. This layout reduces max stress and keeps mass under limit.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths for mass: length(node_1-node_8)=3.0, area 3=1.759; mass=3*1.759=5.277; similarly for other members.
