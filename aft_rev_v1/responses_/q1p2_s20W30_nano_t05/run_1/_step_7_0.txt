  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to meet stress ±20 and mass ≤ 30 under given load and supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 (-10N, -45°), supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller). Current max stress 209.68 > 20, mass 7.73 < 30. Need to reduce stress drastically.",
  "analysis": "Current structure has high tensile and compressive stresses mainly in members connected to node_5 and node_4. The load at node_3 causes large stress in members 4,5,6. Member areas are small leading to overstress. The structure lacks sufficient triangulation near load to distribute forces effectively.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding nodes near load and redistributing members with larger areas can reduce stress. Avoid increasing mass beyond 30. Use efficient triangulation and shorter members to reduce stress and mass. Areas must be chosen carefully from given set.",
  "proposal": "Add one node above node_3 to form a truss triangle with nodes 3,4 and new node. Connect new node to nodes 3,4,5. Increase cross-sectional areas on critical members. Remove less effective members to save mass. Keep supports and load nodes fixed.",
  "reasoning": "Adding node_6 at (2.0, 3.0) creates a vertical bracing near load node_3. This helps reduce bending and stress in members 4,5,6. Increase areas on members carrying load to reduce stress below ±20. Remove direct long members with high stress and replace with multiple smaller members for better load distribution. This balances mass and stress effectively.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and assign area ids to keep stress ≤ 20. Use higher areas for members near load and moderate areas for others. Check total mass sum(length*area_density) ≤ 30. Use area densities from given set: area_id '4' = 3.128, '3' = 1.759, '2' = 0.782, '1' = 0.195.",
  "calculation": "Node_6 at (2.0, 3.0).

Total mass approx = sum(length*area_density) = 2.828*0.782 + 4.472*0.782 + 3.0*3.128 + 1.414*1.759 + 1.118*1.759 + 2.5*0.782 + 2.5*0.195 ≈ 2.21 + 3.5 + 9.38 + 2.49 + 1.97 + 1.95 + 0.49 = 22.0 < 30.
