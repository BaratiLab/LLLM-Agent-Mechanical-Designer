Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current max stress 281.9 too high, mass 22.6 acceptable. Need to reduce stress drastically, especially in member_9 (node_5-node_2) and member_2 (node_2-node_4).",\n\n    "analysis": "Current design has high stress concentration on members connected to node_5 and node_2, especially member_9 with stress ~282. Node_5 is at (4,1.2), causing long member to node_2 (6,0) with small area (1). Member_7 (node_5-node_4) also highly stressed. Member_2 and member_9 are critical. Node_8 at (2,1.5) adds complexity but stress remains high. Load at node_3 (2,0) causes tension/compression in members around it. The structure lacks efficient load path and proper triangulation near load and supports. The current layout with node_5 far from load line and small cross-section in critical members is inefficient.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, increase area in critical members or shorten length. Add nodes to redistribute load and create better triangulation. Keep supports and load nodes fixed. Avoid long slender members with small cross-section. Use larger areas (3 or 4) on members with high forces. Possibly move node_6 closer to load and supports for better force transfer. Remove redundant members causing stress concentration. Aim for a truss with clear triangular load paths from load to supports.",\n\n    "proposal": "Propose 7 nodes: keep node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0). Add node_4 (2.0, 2.2) as top node near load. Add node_5 (4.0, 1.5) closer to load and supports for better triangulation. Add node_6 (3.0, 0.8) intermediate node to reduce long members. Add node_7 (1.0, 1.5) left upper node to form stable triangles. Members: connect node_1-node_7, node_7-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_7-node_3, node_3-node_6, node_6-node_2, node_4-node_3, node_5-node_3, node_1-node_3. Assign areas mostly 3 or 4 for critical members, 1 or 2 for less critical.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Adding node_7 at (1,1.5) creates left triangle with node_1 and node_4, improving load transfer to pinned support. Node_6 at (3,0.8) breaks long members between node_3 and node_2, reducing stress. Node_5 moved slightly down and left to (4,1.5) to shorten and better triangulate. Members with high force paths get larger cross sections (area 3 or 4). Members near supports and load get medium areas to balance mass and stress. This layout improves force distribution, reducing max stress below 20 and total mass under 30.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths calculated by Euclidean distance. Mass = sum(length × area). Areas selected from given set. Stress expected proportional to force/area. Increasing area reduces stress. Triangulation ensures members carry axial loads efficiently. Avoid long slender members with small area to prevent high stress.
