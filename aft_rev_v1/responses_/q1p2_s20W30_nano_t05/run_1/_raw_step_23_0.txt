Current max stress is 19.57, mass is 21.44, both within limits.",\n  "analysis": "Current structure uses 6 nodes with load/support fixed nodes unchanged. Member areas and node positions are optimized to keep max stress just below limit. Mass is well below max allowed. Stress distribution is balanced with no member overstressed.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further node position tweaks may reduce mass slightly but risk increasing stress. Member areas are chosen from allowed discrete set. Current design is a stable truss with no zero-force members.",\n  "reasoning": "Stress near limit indicates efficient material usage. Moving internal nodes may reduce stress marginally but likely increases mass or violates constraints. Current node positions and member areas provide a sound balance between stress and mass. Load and support nodes fixed per instructions. Member connectivity forms a closed 2D truss with triangulation for stability.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Max stress = 19.57 < 20 limit; total mass = 21.44 < 30 limit. Areas selected from given set. No nodes duplicated. Load at node_3 unchanged. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) unchanged. Member areas mostly 3 (1.759) and 2 (0.782) with some 1 (0.195) for lower stress members, balancing mass and strength.",\n  "calculation": "No violations of constraints found. Marginal gains from further repositioning unlikely given proximity to stress limit. Mass has margin for safety. Stress values on members show no critical overload.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints satisfied. No zero or negligible stress members to remove. Structure is closed and stable.
