Need to reduce stress, especially member_4 (-55.57).",\n  \n  "analysis": "High stress on member_4 (node_1-node_3), tensile stress beyond limit. Members connecting load node_3 to supports carry excessive load. Current design has direct long members from load node_5 causing stress concentration. Current node_5 at (2.0,3.0) and members from node_3 to node_5 and node_1 to node_5 cause high mass and stress. Simplify structure, add intermediate node to better distribute forces and reduce stress in critical members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove members causing high tensile stress, add node between node_3 and node_4 to reduce length and redistribute forces. Use smaller areas where stress is low, increase area in critical members but within limits. Avoid members directly connecting node_1 and node_5 or node_2 and node_5 to reduce mass and stress.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Use nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2,1.5), node_5(3.5,1.0).

Members from load node_3 to node_4 and node_5 split load paths. Using moderate areas (area_id 2 or 3) for main load paths, smaller areas (1) for less stressed members. Avoid direct long members from load to supports which cause high stress.
