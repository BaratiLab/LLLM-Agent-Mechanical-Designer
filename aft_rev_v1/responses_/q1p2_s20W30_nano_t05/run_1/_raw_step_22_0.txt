Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current max stress 1285 (too high), mass 8.7 (ok). Areas limited to given discrete set.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high stress in members 4 and 6 (over 1200), indicating insufficient stiffness or poor load path. Mass is low but stress far exceeds limits. Members with area 1 (0.195) or 2 (0.782) insufficient. Need to redistribute forces, increase areas strategically, and improve geometry for better load transfer. Existing load/support nodes fixed; can add or move intermediate nodes. Current design is minimal but fails stress constraints badly, so redesign is needed.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding more nodes to create triangular substructures can improve force distribution. Increase cross-sectional areas on critical members. Avoid long slender members with small area. Use higher areas on load-carrying members. Keep total mass under 30. Try to keep structure symmetric and triangulated for stability.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add one intermediate node between node_3 and node_5 to split load path. Move node_5 slightly upward to reduce compression in member_4. Increase areas on members connecting supports to intermediate nodes. Use areas 3 or 4 on critical members. Maintain triangular connectivity. Members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_3-node_5, node_3-node_6, node_6-node_4 with suitable areas.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular geometry improves load path and reduces stress concentrations. Increasing area reduces stress by increasing stiffness and load capacity. Adding node_6 between node_3 and node_5 creates better force distribution. Using area 3 (1.759) or 4 (3.128) on main load members balances stress and mass. Keep members close to vertical or diagonal to handle compressive and tensile forces efficiently.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths and approximate stresses. Member length ~ sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2). Mass = length * area. Initial guess: node_4 at (2.0,1.5), node_5 at (3.0,2.0), node_6 at (2.5,1.0). Assign area 3 to main load members, area 1 or 2 to secondary members. Check stress by rough proportionality to inverse of area and length.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_4 ~1.5, node_2-node_4 ~1.8, node_3-node_4 ~1.5, node_4-node_5 ~1.12, node_5-node_2 ~1.41, node_3-node_5 ~2.24, node_3-node_6 ~1.12, node_6-node_4 ~0.71. Assign areas: members connected to supports and node_4 area=3 (1.759), node_3-node_5 and node_5-node_2 area=2 (0.782), node_3-node_6 and node_6-node_4 area=1 (0.195). Approximate mass sum ~ (1.5+1.8+1.5)*1.759 + (2.24+1.41)*0.782 + (1.12+0.71)*0.195 + 1.12*0.195 ~ 8.3+2.6+0.6+0.2=11.7 < 30.
