Max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current design max stress 41, mass 19.4. Need to reduce max stress below 20 and keep mass ≤ 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current max stress (member_4: 41) exceeds ±20 limit. Mass is acceptable but can be optimized. Members with high stress are around node_4 and node_6. The current node_6 at (1.5,1.0) creates long slender members with high stress. Members with area 1 are overloaded. The structure lacks sufficient triangulation near the load at node_3. Member_4 (node_6-node_4) is highly stressed (41).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress, increase triangulation and redistribute load paths. Possibly move node_6 closer to node_4 and node_3 to reduce member lengths and stresses. Use higher area for highly stressed members, reduce areas where stress is low. Add a new node to improve load path and reduce stress concentration. Keep load/support nodes fixed.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_7 near load node_3 at (2.5, 1.0) to improve triangulation. Reposition node_6 slightly upwards to (1.8, 1.5) for better force distribution. Members: connect node_1-node_6, node_6-node_7, node_7-node_3, node_7-node_4, node_6-node_4, node_5-node_4, node_5-node_2, node_3-node_5, node_2-node_4, node_1-node_4. Assign areas to keep stress within limits: use area 3 for longer/high stress members, area 1 or 2 for shorter/low stress members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_7 near the load creates a better force path, reducing stress in members near node_3 and node_4. Moving node_6 upwards shortens critical members and improves load transfer. Using area 3 on main load-carrying members balances mass and stress. Smaller areas on bracing members reduce mass. This triangulation ensures all members share load, reducing peak stresses below ±20. Total mass estimated under 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate approximate lengths and assign areas: node_1-node_6 ~1.8^2+1.5^2=2.25+2.25=3.0, length=1.732; node_6-node_7 ~0.7; node_7-node_3 ~1.12; node_7-node_4 ~1.12; node_6-node_4 ~1.0; node_5-node_4 ~0.5; node_5-node_2 ~3.2; node_3-node_5 ~1.58; node_2-node_4 ~4.47; node_1-node_4 ~2.83.
