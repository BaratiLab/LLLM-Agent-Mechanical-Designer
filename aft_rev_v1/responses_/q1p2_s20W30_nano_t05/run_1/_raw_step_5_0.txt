Current max stress 36.26 > 20, mass 11.93 < 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has overstressed member_6 (-36.26) and member_5 (27.03) exceeding ±20. Mass is acceptable but stress is critical. Members with low area (area_id 1 or 2) carry high stress. Geometry has nodes clustered near load but some long members with small area cause stress spikes. Need to reduce stress by increasing cross-sectional areas on critical members and improve load path with additional triangulation near load. Avoid increasing mass beyond 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove or reinforce member_6 and member_5. Possibly add a node between node_3 and node_4 or reposition node_6 for better load distribution. Increase areas on high stress members from 1 or 2 to 3 or 4. Maintain or slightly increase mass but keep under 30. Keep supports and load nodes fixed.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add one intermediate node near load to improve force distribution. Increase areas on critical members. Remove redundant or low-stress members with low area. Members: node_1-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_3-node_6 (new node), node_4-node_6, node_6-node_5, node_5-node_2. Areas chosen to keep stress < ±20 and mass < 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_6 near load reduces length and stress in member_3-node_4 and member_3-node_6. Larger areas on members carrying high load reduce stress. Triangulation ensures stability and load path efficiency. Avoid excessively large areas to keep mass low. Use area_id 3 or 4 for critical members, 1 or 2 for less stressed. Keep load and support nodes fixed to maintain boundary conditions.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths, assign areas, estimate mass = sum(length × area × density factor).
