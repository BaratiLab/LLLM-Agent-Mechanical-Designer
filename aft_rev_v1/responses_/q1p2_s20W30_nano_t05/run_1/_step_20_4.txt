  "preamble": "Optimize truss to satisfy max stress ±20 and mass ≤ 30 under given load and supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3: 10 units at -45°. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Current max stress 68.5 > 20, mass 5.13 < 30. Need to reduce max stress by improving force distribution.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design has high tensile/compressive stress in members between node_1-node_3 and node_2-node_4. The truss is minimal with one top node (node_4) at y=1.5. Members directly connecting support and load nodes carry excessive load. Adding intermediate nodes and diagonal bracing can reduce stress concentrations and redistribute forces effectively.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a node above node_3 to form a triangular truss shape can reduce bending moments and stress. Use larger cross-sectional areas for critical members and smaller for others to keep mass low. Maintain existing support and load nodes fixed.",
  
  "proposal": "Add one new node (node_5) above node_3 at (2.0, 3.0). Connect node_5 to node_1, node_2, node_3, and node_4. Use areas to balance stress and mass. Members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_5, node_4-node_5, node_1-node_5, node_2-node_5. This forms multiple load paths and triangulation.",
  
  "reasoning": "Triangulation with node_5 redistributes load from node_3 downward and sideways to supports. This reduces stress in direct members from node_1 and node_2 to node_3. Using moderate areas for longer members and smaller areas for shorter members optimizes mass. The new layout respects fixed nodes and load/support conditions.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Estimate member lengths and assign areas from given set {0:1,1:0.195,2:0.782,3:1.759,4:3.128,5:4.887,...}. Calculate approximate mass = Σ length*area. Check stress reduction by triangulation. Ensure max stress ≤20 and mass ≤30.",
