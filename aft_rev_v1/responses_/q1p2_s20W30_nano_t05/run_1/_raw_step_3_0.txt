Current max stress 34.19 > 20, mass 11.2 < 30. Need to reduce max stress by better geometry and/or member sizing.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has 4 nodes with node_4 at (2,2). High stresses on members 4 (34.19) and 5 (27.03) exceed limit. Member areas are small on critical members (area_id \'1\' or \'2\'). Lengths and connectivity cause stress concentration. Adding nodes or changing geometry can improve force distribution. Member 4 and 5 connect top node_4 to supports, possibly overloaded. Current mass is acceptable but stress too high.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding an intermediate node above node_4 to create a more triangular bracing system. Increase area on high stress members. Possibly remove or replace member_5 with better angle. Keep load and support nodes fixed. Avoid excessive mass increase.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (3.0, 3.0) above node_4 to form a stiffer top frame. Connect node_5 to node_4, node_2, and node_3 to form triangulated bracing. Increase area of members connected to node_4 and node_5 to reduce stress. Remove member_5 (node_2-node_4) to reduce stress concentration and replace with members to node_5. Use area_id \'3\' or \'4\' for critical members. Keep member_3 (node_3-node_1) with area_id \'1\' to save mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 creates a triangular truss top chord reducing bending and stress in members 4 and 5. Triangulation improves load path and stiffness. Increasing cross-sectional area on critical members reduces stress. Removing member_5 avoids stress concentration between node_2 and node_4. Connections from node_5 to node_2, node_3, and node_4 distribute load better. Areas chosen balance stress and mass constraints. Node positions fixed for load/support, new node placed to optimize geometry and minimize member length increase.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Members: node_1-node_2 (area 2), node_2-node_3 (area 2), node_3-node_1 (area 1), node_1-node_4 (area 1), node_3-node_4 (area 2), node_4-node_5 (area 3), node_5-node_2 (area 3), node_5-node_3 (area 3).
