Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current max stress 44.3 > 20 limit. Total mass 7.67 < 30 limit. Need to reduce max stress below ±20.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current max stress is at member_3 (-44.3 compressive), which is node_3-node_1. This member is overloaded. Members 4 and 5 are highly stressed in tension (34.2 and 27.0). The structure is a triangle with an internal node_4 at (2,2). The load at node_3 is pulling diagonally down-left. The current member areas are mostly small (area ids 1,2). Increasing cross-sectional areas on critical members can reduce stress but increases mass. Alternatively, adding a new node to create more load paths and reduce stress concentration is viable. Node_3 is between node_1 and node_2 on the base line, which may cause high compression in member_3. Moving node_4 or adding a node above node_3 can better distribute forces.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing stress in member_3 by adding a node above node_3 to form two triangles sharing the load. Increase areas on critical members within mass limits. Keep supports and load nodes fixed. Use areas from given set.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node_5 above node_3 at (2.0, 3.0) to form two triangles: node_1-node_4-node_5 and node_2-node_4-node_5. Connect node_5 to node_3, node_4, node_1 and node_2 to distribute load. Adjust areas to reduce stress below 20 and keep mass < 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 above node_3 creates a stiffer vertical structure to carry load. This reduces compressive stress on member_3. Members connected to node_5 will carry vertical load better. Increase area of members carrying higher load but keep others minimal to control mass. Use area ids 3 to 5 for critical members and 1 or 2 for others. This approach distributes forces and reduces peak stresses.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_3 to node_5 vertical 3m, node_4 to node_5 vertical 1m, node_1 to node_5 diagonal sqrt(2^2 + 3^2)=3.6056m, node_2 to node_5 diagonal sqrt(4^2 + 3^2)=5m. Assign areas: members from node_5 to node_3 and node_4 area 3 (1.759), to node_1 and node_2 area 4 (3.128). Other members area 1 or 2 as needed. Estimate mass = sum(length * area). Verify max stress < 20 by reducing compressive load on member_3.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths and areas: \\n- member_3 (node_3-node_1): length=2m, area=1 (0.195) reduced to minimal to reduce mass; \\n- new member_7 (node_3-node_5): length=3m, area=3 (1.759); \\n- new member_8 (node_4-node_5): length=1m, area=3 (1.759); \\n- new member_9 (node_1-node_5): length=3.6056m, area=4 (3.128); \\n- new member_10 (node_2-node_5): length=5m, area=4 (3.128); \\n- keep members 1,2,4,5 with areas 1 or 2; \\nTotal estimated mass ~ sum(length*area) ≈ under 30.
