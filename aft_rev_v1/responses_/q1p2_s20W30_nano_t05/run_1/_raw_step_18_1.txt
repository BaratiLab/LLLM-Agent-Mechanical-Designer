Current max stress 193.6 > 20, mass 23.8 < 30. Need to reduce stress drastically, especially in member_5 with -193.6 stress. Areas range 0=1 to 10=19.548. Current design has many small members with high stress. Nodes fixed at load/support points; can add/move internal nodes.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High compressive stress in member_5 (node_5-node_2) indicates load path concentration. Members connecting load node_3 to support node_2 are overstressed. Current node_6 near load insufficient to distribute forces. The truss lacks adequate triangulation and load path redundancy. The structure is somewhat asymmetric and has members with very small areas (1, 2, 3) leading to high stress. Mass is below limit but stress constraints are violated.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, increase area in highly stressed members or add nodes to redistribute forces. Adding internal nodes closer to load node_3 and between load and supports can create better force paths. Use larger area members in critical load paths. Maintain triangular geometry for stability. Avoid very long slender members that cause buckling or high stress.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add an internal node closer to node_3 and between node_4 and node_5 to redistribute load. Connect node_3 to new node, new node to node_4 and node_5, and node_5 to node_2. Increase areas in members from load to supports. Remove or reduce area of low-stressed members to save mass. Use areas mostly in range 3-5 for critical members to keep stress below 20 and mass under 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangulated geometry with additional internal node near load reduces stress concentration. Larger cross-sectional areas in critical members reduce stress. Keeping node_1 and node_2 fixed as supports, and node_3 fixed for load, adding node_6 at (2.3,1.2) creates shorter members and better load transfer. Members from node_3 to node_6, node_6 to node_4, node_6 to node_5, and node_5 to node_2 form a stable load path. Use area=4 (3.128) or 5 (4.887) for these members to reduce stress. Other members with low stress can have smaller areas to keep mass low.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and estimate mass: e.g. length(node_3-node_6) ~ sqrt((2.3-2)^2+(1.2-0)^2)=1.204, mass=length*area. Sum masses to check ≤30. Estimate stress reduction by increasing area and shortening members. Remove members with negligible force to save mass. Verify max stress ≤20.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node positions: node_6 at (2.3,1.2).
