Constraints: max stress Â±20, max mass 30. Current max stress 36.26 > 20, mass 25.68 < 30. Need to reduce max stress by redesign or member sizing.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has a high tensile stress (-36.26) in member_8 (node_1-node_3) and zero stress in some members. Load is eccentric causing high stress in direct member from node_1 to node_3. Members with large cross-section areas (area_id 3 and 4) add mass. Current layout has nodes near load but stress concentration remains high. Member from node_1 to node_3 is critical and overstressed. Need to redistribute forces by adding intermediate nodes or triangulation to reduce stress. Avoid increasing mass beyond 30. Current mass is acceptable, so can add some members but keep lightweight. Areas can be optimized by reducing large areas to smaller where stress is low.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a node between node_1 and node_3 or between node_3 and node_4 can redistribute forces. Triangulate the region around node_3 and node_5 to share load. Use smaller areas on less stressed members to reduce mass. Use area_id 2 or 1 for less stressed members, keep area_id 3 or 4 only where necessary. Remove member_8 (node_1-node_3) which is highly stressed and replace with a triangulated path.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_6 at (1.5,1.0) to create a triangulated path from node_1 to node_3 to node_6 to node_4. Remove direct member node_1-node_3. Connect node_6 to node_4 and node_3. Connect node_6 to node_5 (3.0,1.5) to help transfer load. Keep node_5 at (3.0,1.5). Members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_6, node_6-node_4, node_6-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_5-node_2, node_3-node_5. Assign areas to reduce mass and stress: area_id 3 for main load carrying members, area_id 1 or 2 for secondary.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Direct member node_1-node_3 caused high stress due to load direction. Adding node_6 at (1.5,1.0) creates a triangulated path to redistribute forces and reduce stress in any single member. Triangulation is a classical method to reduce bending and high axial stress. Using smaller cross-section areas where stress is low reduces mass. Keeping load and support nodes fixed as per instructions. Member connections avoid duplication.
