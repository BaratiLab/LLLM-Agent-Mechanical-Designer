  "preamble": "Optimized 2D truss to meet stress and mass constraints with given loads and supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: Max stress ≤ ±20, total mass ≤ 30. Load at node_3 (-10N, -45°). Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Current max stress 38.7 > 20, mass 41.6 > 30. Need lighter, less stressed design.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design has excessive mass and stress mainly in members connected to node_5 and member_3. Node_5 adds heavy members with large areas. Members 9 and 10 have very large areas and mass, contributing to total mass >30. Member_3 is highly stressed in compression (-38.7).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_5 and its heavy members to reduce mass. Reconfigure members to form stable triangular truss between node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4. Use moderate area sizes to reduce stress and mass. Avoid long slender members with large cross-sections.",
  
  "proposal": "Remove node_5 and members connected to it. Use nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (2,2). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_2. Assign areas to keep stresses within ±20 and total mass ≤ 30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Removing node_5 reduces mass significantly. The simpler trapezoidal truss with diagonal (node_3-node_4) provides good load transfer. Areas selected to balance stress and mass. Member_3 (node_3-node_1) area reduced to reduce compressive stress. Member_1 and member_2 moderate areas to carry tension/compression. Diagonal member_6 (node_3-node_4) area moderate to stabilize structure.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths and assign areas from given set. Check stresses roughly proportional to force/area. Aim max stress ≤20, total mass ≤30. Lengths: node_1-node_2=6, node_1-node_3=2, node_3-node_2=4, node_1-node_4=√(2²+0²)=2, node_2-node_4=√(4²+2²)=4.472, node_3-node_4=2.0. Assign areas: member_1=2 (0.782), member_2=2 (0.782), member_3=1 (0.195), member_4=1 (0.195), member_5=1 (0.195), member_6=2 (0.782). Calculate mass = sum(length * area).",
  
  "calculation": "Mass = 6*0.782 + 2*0.195 + 4*0.782 + 2*0.195 + 4.472*0.195 + 2*0.782 = 4.692 + 0.39 + 3.128 + 0.39 + 0.871 + 1.564 = 10.135 < 30. Estimated max stress reduced due to increased area on main members and removal of heavy node_5 members. All stresses expected ≤20.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Structure simpler, lighter, stable triangular truss with diagonal. Mass well below limit, stress reduced by area selection. No duplicate nodes or members. Load and support nodes fixed. Areas selected from allowed set. Node positions precise floats.",
