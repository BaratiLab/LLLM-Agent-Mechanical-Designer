Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current max stress 98.4 > 20, mass 19.2 < 30. Need to reduce stress drastically and keep mass under 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high stresses in members 2,4,5,6, exceeding ±20. Mass is acceptable. Members with large stress have small areas, causing overstress. Complex node layout with nodes 6 and 7 near load. Load is eccentric and diagonal, requiring good triangulation near node_3 and load path to supports. Current members with small areas near load cause stress concentration.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, increase cross-sectional areas on critical members, add triangulation to distribute load, reposition internal nodes for better load path. Avoid long slender members. Keep mass under 30 by limiting large-area members. Use areas 1 or 2 for low-stress members, 3 or 4 for high-stress members. Remove redundant members with low force or high stress. Maintain load/support nodes fixed.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Propose a truss with 7 nodes: fixed nodes 1,2,3; internal nodes 4,5,6 placed to form strong triangulation. Members connecting supports to load node and internal nodes with areas selected to keep stress ≤ 20 and mass < 30. Add diagonal members from load node to supports and internal nodes. Increase areas on members carrying load. Remove overstressed small area members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Load at node_3 is diagonal down-left, so members from node_3 to node_1 and node_4 should carry tension/compression efficiently. Node_4 placed above node_3 to form triangle with node_1 and node_2. Node_5 near mid-span between node_2 and node_4 to distribute load. Node_6 near node_3 and node_4 to improve triangulation. Use larger areas (3 or 4) on members near load and supports to reduce stress. Use smaller areas (1 or 2) on less stressed members to control mass. Remove members with zero or negligible force to simplify structure.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths and estimate mass = sum(length * area). Use area values: \'1\':0.195, \'2\':0.782, \'3\':1.759, \'4\':3.128. Target mass < 30. Calculate approximate stress by considering load path and member stiffness. Adjust node positions slightly to optimize angles and reduce bending moments.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node positions: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0) fixed. Internal nodes: node_4(2,2.2), node_5(4,1.2), node_6(2.5,1.5). Members and areas: m1(node_1-node_4, area 3), m2(node_2-node_4, area 3), m3(node_3-node_4, area 4), m4(node_3-node_6, area 3), m5(node_6-node_4, area 2), m6(node_6-node_5, area 1), m7(node_5-node_4, area 2), m8(node_5-node_2, area 1), m9(node_1-node_3, area 1), m10(node_5-node_3, area 1).
