  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to satisfy max stress ±20 and mass ≤30 under given loads and supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 (-10N, -45°), supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller. Current max stress 44.64 > 20 limit, mass 19.5 < 30 limit. Need to reduce max stress by better load path and member sizing.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design has a long member_7 (node_1-node_3) with high compressive stress (-44.64). This member is critical and oversized but overstressed. Members around node_4 and node_5 carry moderate stress. Load at node_3 creates bending and high compression in member_7. Current node_5 position at (3.0,1.5) is low, causing inefficient force transfer. Member areas are mostly medium to large (areas 1-3).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress, redistribute forces by adding a node above node_3 to create triangular load paths. Increase stiffness near load and supports. Use smaller areas on low-stress members. Avoid large area on member_7; reduce length or split load path.",
  
  "proposal": "Add node_6 above node_3 at (2.0, 3.0). Connect node_3-node_6, node_6-node_4, node_6-node_5. Remove direct large area member_7 (node_1-node_3). Use smaller areas on direct members from node_1 to node_3. Increase area on members forming triangles near load to spread stress. Adjust member areas to keep mass ≤30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Introducing node_6 creates a truss triangle above node_3, effectively transferring load to supports via multiple paths, reducing max stress on any single member. Smaller area on direct node_1-node_3 reduces overstressed member mass and stress. Using areas 3 or 4 on critical members near load and supports balances strength and mass. Triangular configurations are structurally efficient for 2D trusses.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_6, node_6-node_4, node_6-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_5-node_2, node_1-node_3. Areas selected from {1,2,3,4}. Node_6 at (2.0,3.0) adds vertical height to improve force distribution. Estimate member lengths and areas to keep total mass ≤30.",
