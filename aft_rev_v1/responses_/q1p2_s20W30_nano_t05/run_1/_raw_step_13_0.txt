Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current max stress 281.9 > 20 limit, mass 26.94 < 30 limit. Need to reduce max stress drastically, especially member_8 (node_5-node_2) and others with high stress. Areas range from 0.195 to 19.548. Nodes fixed at supports and load; can add/move internal nodes.",\n  "analysis": "Current design has high stress concentration on member_8 (area=1, mass=0.4548) with 281.9 stress, exceeding Â±20. Members near load and roller support are overstressed. Member areas are mostly small; increasing area selectively or changing topology needed. Member_8 is short but overstressed, indicating load path issue. Current nodes are clustered near load but insufficient bracing near roller node_2. Mass is under limit but stress is critical. Need to improve load transfer from node_3 to supports.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Options: add internal nodes between node_3 and node_2 to distribute load; increase area of critical members; add diagonal braces to reduce bending; keep mass under 30. Avoid long slender members with small area. Use larger areas for highly stressed members. Possibly remove member_9 and member_10 which have high compressive stresses and low areas, replacing with stiffer bracing. Maintain node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_4 at (2,2.2) and node_5 at (4,1.2) can be adjusted slightly.",\n  "proposal": "Add a new node between node_3 and node_2 at (3.5,0.8) to create a stiffer load path. Modify members to include this node and increase areas of members connecting load node_3 to supports. Remove members with very high stress and low area (member_8, member_9, member_10). Use areas 3 or 4 for main load-carrying members. Final topology: members from node_1 to node_4, node_2 to node_4, node_4 to node_5, node_5 to new node_7, node_7 to node_3, node_3 to node_6, node_6 to node_4. Increase areas on members connected to node_3 and node_7 to reduce stress.",\n  "reasoning": "Adding node_7 at (3.5,0.8) creates shorter members between node_3 and node_2, reducing stress in long members. Increasing cross-sectional areas on members carrying high stress reduces stress by increasing capacity. Removing overstressed small area members avoids failure. Triangulating structure improves stability and load path. Node_6 remains at (2.5,1.5) to support load transfer to node_4 and node_5. Areas selected from given set to balance mass and stress. Total mass estimated below 30 after increasing some areas and removing redundant members.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and areas to estimate mass: e.g., member node_3-node_7 length ~ sqrt((3.5-2)^2 + (0.8-0)^2) = ~1.8, area=3.128, mass ~ 5.6. Sum all member masses to ensure <30. Check max stress by distributing load through multiple paths with increased areas. Remove members with stress >20 by topology change and area increase. Use pinned and roller supports to prevent rigid body motion. Ensure no duplicate members or nodes.",\n  "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_4 ~ 2.2, node_2-node_4 ~ 2.5, node_4-node_5 ~ 2.0, node_5-node_7 ~ 1.5, node_7-node_3 ~ 1.8, node_3-node_6 ~ 1.12, node_6-node_4 ~ 1.1. Areas assigned: 3 for node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4 (mass ~ 3.9 + 4.4), 2 for node_4-node_5 and node_6-node_4 (mass ~ 1.56 + 0.86), 1 for node_5-node_7 and node_7-node_3 (mass ~ 0.29 + 0.34), 1 for node_3-node_6 (mass ~ 0.21). Total mass ~ 12.5, well below 30. Stress reduced by increased areas and better load paths. Max stress expected < 20 due to better triangulation and larger areas on critical members.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate members or nodes. Node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed.
