Current design has max stress 321.36 (member_6) exceeding limit and mass 16.45 under max. Load is -10 at node_3 at -45°. Supports fixed. Nodes 1,2,3 fixed, can add/move others. Need to reduce stress in member_6 and balance forces, possibly adding diagonal bracing near node_3 and redistributing members.",\n  "analysis": "Current design stress is concentrated in member_6 (node_3-node_6) with very high stress 321.36, well above ±20 limit. This member is short and carries large load, area is minimal (area_id=1). Other members have low or zero stress. Mass is acceptable. The structure lacks sufficient bracing near node_3 to distribute load effectively. The load direction (-45°) induces tension/compression diagonally. The design uses node_6 at (2.5,1.5) and node_7 at (3.5,0.8) which may not optimally support load. Need to add nodes and members to create stable triangular substructures to reduce stress concentration. Use larger areas for high stress members and smaller areas for others to keep mass low.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding a node above node_3 to form a triangle with node_4 and node_3. Connect node_3 to node_4 directly and via new node. Also add diagonal from node_3 to node_5 or node_4. Increase area of critical members. Remove unnecessary members with zero stress. Avoid long slender members. Use areas 3 or 4 for key load paths. Keep total mass under 30.",\n  "proposal": "Add a new node_8 at (2.0, 1.5) above node_3, connect node_3-node_8, node_8-node_4, node_8-node_6. Connect node_3-node_5. Remove node_7 and its members to simplify. Use area 3 (1.759) for critical members (node_3-node_8, node_8-node_4, node_8-node_6), area 2 (0.782) for node_3-node_5 and node_5-node_4, area 1 (0.195) for others. This creates multiple load paths and reduces stress concentration on member_6 equivalent.",\n  "reasoning": "Adding node_8 creates a triangular bracing system near node_3, distributing load more evenly. Connecting node_3 to node_5 adds a direct load path reducing stress on node_3-node_6. Increasing area of critical members reduces stress. Removing node_7 and its members reduces unnecessary mass and complexity. Using smaller areas for less stressed members keeps mass low. This design should keep mass under 30 and max stress under ±20.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_3(2,0), node_8(2,1.5) length=1.5; node_8(2,1.5)-node_4(2,2.2) length=0.7; node_8(2,1.5)-node_6(2.5,1.5) length=0.5; node_3-node_5(4,1.2) length=~2.28; node_5-node_4(4,1.2)-(2,2.2) length=~2.28.
