Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Max stress ±20 and max mass ≤30. Current max stress 22.94 > 20 and mass 34.23 > 30, redesign needed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has overstressed member_8 (-22.94) and total mass exceeds limit. Member_8 connects node_3 to node_4 with area 2. Large stress indicates load path inefficiency. Reducing member areas and reconfiguring nodes to improve load distribution and reduce mass is necessary. Nodes for load and supports fixed, but intermediate nodes can be repositioned or added.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider simpler truss with fewer members, shorter members, and lower area indices. Introduce a single intermediate node above node_3 to create a triangular load path, reducing bending and high stress. Use smaller cross-sectional areas for members under low stress and larger areas only for critical load paths.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep nodes 1, 2, 3 fixed. Add node_4 at (2.0, 1.5) above node_3. Connect members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3. Assign areas to balance stress and mass: smaller areas for longer members, moderate areas for load path members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular configuration with node_4 above node_3 creates efficient load transfer from node_3 to supports. Shorter members reduce member length and mass. Using area 2 (0.782) for load carrying members and area 1 (0.195) for others reduces mass. Avoid overstressing by limiting area sizes and member lengths. This structure is statically determinate and stable.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_1-node_4 ≈ sqrt(2^2 + 1.5^2) = 2.5; node_2-node_4 ≈ sqrt(4^2 + 1.5^2) = 4.27; node_3-node_4 = 1.5; node_1-node_3=2; node_2-node_3=4. Areas chosen to keep mass ≤30 and stress ≤20.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Mass = sum(length × area). Members and areas: m1(node_1-node_4, area 2): 2.5×0.782=1.955; m2(node_2-node_4, area 1): 4.27×0.195=0.83; m3(node_3-node_4, area 2):1.5×0.782=1.173; m4(node_1-node_3, area 1):2×0.195=0.39; m5(node_2-node_3, area 1):4×0.195=0.78; Total mass approx 5.13 <30.
