Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current design mass 21.7, max stress 25.3 (exceeds stress). Need to reduce stress by better load path and member sizing.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has multiple members from node_3 to node_6 and node_5, and node_2 to node_5 with high stresses. Member_7 (node_2-node_5) has stress 25.3 > 20. Mass is under limit but stress is not. Nodes 5 and 6 are close, causing inefficient load transfer. The force at node_3 is diagonal down-left, so a truss path transferring load to supports at node_1 and node_2 is needed with well-oriented members. Current layout has redundant members and oversized areas causing stress concentration.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_6 to simplify. Move node_5 slightly left and down to better align members. Add diagonal members from node_3 to supports and node_5 to supports. Use smaller member areas where stresses are low, larger where stresses high. Avoid long slender members. Use area IDs 2 or 3 for primary load paths, 1 or 0 for secondary. Aim for mass ~20-25 and max stress ≤ 20.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Nodes: Keep node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0). Move node_4 to (2,2). Move node_5 to (3,1.5) for better load transfer. Remove node_6. Members: node_1-node_4 (area 3), node_2-node_4 (area 3), node_3-node_4 (area 2), node_3-node_5 (area 3), node_5-node_4 (area 2), node_5-node_2 (area 1), node_1-node_3 (area 1). This creates a stable triangulated truss with direct load paths and reduced member length.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Moving node_5 down reduces eccentricity and bending. Removing node_6 removes redundant member and stress concentration. Using moderate areas balances mass and strength. Triangulation ensures stability. Members from load node_3 to node_4 and node_5 carry load efficiently to supports at node_1 and node_2. Smaller areas on less stressed members minimize mass.
