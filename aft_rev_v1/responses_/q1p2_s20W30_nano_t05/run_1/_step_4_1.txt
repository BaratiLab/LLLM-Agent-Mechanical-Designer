  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to meet stress ±20 and mass ≤30 constraints.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current load at node_3 with -10N at -45°. Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Existing nodes fixed for load/support. Max stress 34.19 > 20 limit. Mass 25.84 < 30 limit. Need to reduce stress mainly in member_4 and member_3.",
  
  "analysis": "High stress in member_4 (node_1-node_4) and member_3 (node_3-node_1) indicates load path concentration. Member_4 is tensile at 34.19, member_3 compressive at -30.85. Current geometry has node_4 and node_5 added but member_5 (node_2-node_4) removed in last iteration, reducing load redistribution. Member_1 (node_1-node_2) large area but still stressed. The structure lacks sufficient triangulation around load node_3 to distribute stresses.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Add member from node_2 to node_4 to improve triangulation and reduce member_4 stress. Possibly add a node above node_4 to spread load. Use smaller areas on low-stress members to reduce mass. Increase area on critical members but keep total mass ≤30. Keep node_5 but reposition for better load path.",
  
  "proposal": "Add member_5: node_2-node_4 with area 1 (0.195). Add node_6 at (3.0, 2.5) to form better triangulation with node_4 and node_5. Connect node_6 to node_4 and node_5 with smaller area members. Adjust areas: member_4 and member_3 to area 2 (0.782), member_1 area 2 (0.782), other members area 1 or 0 as per stress. Remove member_9 (node_5-node_3) to reduce redundancy and mass.",
  
  "reasoning": "Adding node_6 creates more triangles to distribute load. Connecting node_2 to node_4 restores triangulation lost in iteration 3. Reducing area on low-stress members saves mass. Increasing area on high-stress members reduces stress. Removing member_9 reduces mass and complexity without losing stability. This balances stress and mass constraints.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approx: node_1-node_2=6m, node_1-node_3=2m, node_2-node_3=4m, node_1-node_4=~2.828m, node_2-node_4=~4.472m, node_4-node_5=~1.414m, node_5-node_2=~3.162m, node_4-node_6=~1.118m, node_5-node_6=~1.118m. Area assignments: member_1=2(0.782), member_3=2(0.782), member_4=2(0.782), member_5=1(0.195), members to node_6=1(0.195). Calculate mass sum and check <30. Expected stress reduction due to better triangulation and load path.",
  
  "calculation": "Mass = sum(length × area_factor). Approximate: member_1:6×0.782=4.692, member_3:2×0.782=1.564, member_4:2.828×0.782=2.212, member_5:4.472×0.195=0.872, member_2:4×0.195=0.78 (reduce area), member_6-node_4:1.118×0.195=0.218, member_6-node_5:1.118×0.195=0.218, member_7(node_4-node_5):1.414×0.195=0.276. Total ≈ 10.53 well under 30. Stress expected <20 with improved triangulation and moderate areas.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "All members have unique connections, no duplicates. Load/support nodes fixed. Node_6 added for better load distribution. Areas chosen from given set. Mass under 30, stress expected under 20. Ready to finalize.",
