Load at node_3 (-10N, -45°). Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Current max stress 38.7 > 20, mass 41.6 > 30. Need lighter, less stressed design.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has excessive mass and stress mainly in members connected to node_5 and member_3. Node_5 adds heavy members with large areas. Members 9 and 10 have very large areas and mass, contributing to total mass >30. Member_3 is highly stressed in compression (-38.7).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_5 and its heavy members to reduce mass. Reconfigure members to form stable triangular truss between node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4. Use moderate area sizes to reduce stress and mass. Avoid long slender members with large cross-sections.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_5 and members connected to it. Use nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (2,2). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_2. Assign areas to keep stresses within ±20 and total mass ≤ 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing node_5 reduces mass significantly. The simpler trapezoidal truss with diagonal (node_3-node_4) provides good load transfer. Areas selected to balance stress and mass. Member_3 (node_3-node_1) area reduced to reduce compressive stress. Member_1 and member_2 moderate areas to carry tension/compression.
