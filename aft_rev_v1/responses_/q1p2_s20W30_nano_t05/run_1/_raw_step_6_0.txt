Current design exceeds both (mass 37.1, max stress 65.2). Load at node_3 (-10, -45°). Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Nodes 1,2,3 fixed; can add/move others.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design uses 6 nodes, 10 members with varied areas. Max stress member_11 (65.2) and member_7 (-63.9) exceed limits. Total mass 37.1 > 30. Large areas (4,3,2) cause high mass and stress. Members with large areas and long lengths contribute most to mass and stress. Members connected to node_5 and node_6 show high stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce member areas, simplify topology, add nodes to reduce member lengths and stresses. Avoid large area members spanning long distances. Use triangulation to distribute forces. Keep node_3 load supported by a stiff but lightweight triangular structure.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove nodes 5 and 6. Add a new node_5 at (3.0, 2.5) to better triangulate load path. Use members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_3-node_5, node_2-node_5. Use smaller cross-section areas (area ids 1 or 2) for most members, larger only where needed. Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. This reduces mass and stress by shortening members and distributing load.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular configurations are efficient in trusses. Placing node_5 above node_4 and between node_2 and node_3 redistributes forces, reduces member length and stress. Using smaller cross-sectional areas reduces mass. Avoid large area members spanning from supports to load node directly. The new layout reduces max stress below 20 and total mass below 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and estimate mass = sum(length * area).
