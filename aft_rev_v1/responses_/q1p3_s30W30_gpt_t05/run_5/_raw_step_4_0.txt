Current max stress on member_3 tension 23.15, member_6 compression 10.98. Areas mostly small to medium.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current max stress is under limit but member_3 tension is high. Member_5 area was increased to 2 from 1 last iteration reducing stress on member_5 but increasing mass. Member_6 and 7 stresses are moderate but could be reduced by slight node_5 repositioning. Node_5 currently at (2.0, 1.0). Load at node_3 fixed at (2.0, 0.0). Supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. Members connect node_5 to node_1, node_2, and node_3. Member_5 connects node_3 and node_4 with area 2, member_1 area 3, member_2 area 2, others mostly 1.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try lowering node_5 slightly below 1.0 to reduce tension in member_3 and compression in member_6. Possibly reduce area of member_5 back to 1 or 0.782 to reduce mass without increasing stress beyond limit. Member_1 and member_2 areas seem appropriate. Member_3 area 1 is minimal, increasing it could reduce stress but increase mass. Balance needed.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Reducing node_5 y-coordinate slightly (e.g. 0.8-0.9) may reduce bending effects and redistribute forces, lowering max stress. Reducing member_5 area from 2 to 1.759 or 0.782 will reduce mass but may increase stress. Since max stress is 23.15 < 30, small increase allowed. Member_6 and 7 can keep area 1 to maintain stiffness. Member_1 area 3 and member_2 area 2 are effective for load transfer. Member_3 area 1 is minimal; increasing it may reduce stress but increase mass. Prioritize node repositioning first then area adjustment.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_5 new y = 0.85 (from 1.0). Member_5 area from 2 to 1.759.
