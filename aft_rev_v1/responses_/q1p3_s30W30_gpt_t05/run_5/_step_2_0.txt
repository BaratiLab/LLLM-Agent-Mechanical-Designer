  "preamble": "Optimize node_5 position to reduce max stress while maintaining constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Goal is to minimize max stress <= 30 and mass <= 30. Current max stress is 21.05, mass 10.52, both within limits. Load at node_3, supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. Node_5 added improves mass and stress from iteration_0. Areas mostly small (1 or 2).",
  "analysis": "Max stress is dominated by member_5 (-21.05) and members connected to node_5 have moderate stress. Node_5 is currently at (2.0, 1.5). Moving node_5 vertically or slightly horizontally can redistribute forces in members 5,6,7,8 to reduce peak stress. Node_3 and supports fixed. Mass is well below limit, so area can be adjusted slightly if needed. The truss is closed with 5 nodes and 8 members.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_5 slightly upwards to reduce compression in member_5 and tension in members 6,7,8. Try node_5 at (2.0, 1.8). This may reduce stress in member_5 and balance forces better. Keep member areas same initially. Check if stress reduces. If stress reduces, can consider minor area reduction in low-stress members to reduce mass further.",
  "reasoning": "Member_5 has highest compressive stress (-21.05). Increasing the height of node_5 increases its length to node_4 and node_3, potentially reducing force concentration. Members 6,7,8 connect node_5 to supports and node_3; adjusting node_5 position redistributes load paths. Keeping node_3 fixed preserves load application point. Areas are mostly minimal; no need to increase areas which increase mass.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_5: (2.0,1.5). Move to (2.0,1.8). Length member_5 increases, reducing stress. Check member lengths and verify mass. Areas remain same: member_5 area=1, member_6=1, member_7=1, member_8=1. Mass should remain under 30. Stress expected to reduce max from 21.05 to ~18-20. If successful, continue optimization or stop if no better improvement.",
  "calculation": "Node_5 new position: (2.0, 1.8). Member lengths recalculated: member_5 length ~ sqrt((2.0-2.0)^2 + (3.0-1.8)^2)=1.2 (was 1.5). Actually length decreases, so stress might increase. Try moving node_5 slightly horizontally: (2.2,1.8). Member_5 length ~ sqrt((2.0-2.2)^2 + (3.0-1.8)^2)=sqrt(0.04+1.44)=1.204, slightly less than 1.5. Need to increase length to reduce stress. Try (2.0,1.2) instead. Length member_5 = sqrt(0+1.8^2)=1.8 >1.5, so stress reduces. Members 6,7,8 length adjust accordingly. This should reduce max stress. Mass recalculated with same areas remains ~10.5 <30. Proceed with node_5 at (2.0,1.2).",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Move node_5 vertically down from 1.5 to 1.2 to increase length of critical member_5, reducing compressive stress. Maintain member areas. Mass and max stress constraints satisfied. Stop only if next iteration shows no improvement.",
