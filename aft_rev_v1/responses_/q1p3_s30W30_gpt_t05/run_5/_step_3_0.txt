  "preamble": "Optimize node_5 position to reduce max stress while maintaining constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Goal: reduce max stress (23.57) under 30, mass under 30. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Areas mostly low (1 or 2 or 3). Node_5 moved from 1.5 to 1.2 lowered mass and stress slightly.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress member_5 (-23.5674) and member_6 (16.4491) are critical. Member_5 connects node_3-node_4, member_6 connects node_5-node_1. Both have area '1' (0.195 area). Lengths and geometry influence stress. Node_5 vertical position impacts stress distribution in members connected to it and node_3. Current node_5 at (2.0, 1.2) reduced stress from previous iteration (1.5).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try lowering node_5 slightly below 1.2 or shifting horizontally a bit to reduce stress in member_5 and member_6. Keep node_5 above 0 to avoid collapse. Also consider increasing area of high-stress members if mass allows.",
  
  "reasoning": "Shifting node_5 down to ~1.0 or 1.1 reduces vertical component of forces in members 6 and 8, potentially reducing member_6 stress. Horizontal shift may help balance forces. Member_5 stress is compressive and high; increasing its area from '1' to '2' (0.782) can reduce stress but increases mass. Current mass is 10.4122, well below limit 30, so small area increase is acceptable. Prioritize geometry optimization first to minimize stress before increasing area to save mass.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_5 at (2.0, 1.0) or (2.1, 1.1) tested in mind. Member lengths roughly: m6 (node_5-node_1) length ~ sqrt((2-0)^2 + (1-0)^2)=~2.236, m8 (node_3-node_5) length ~ sqrt((2-2)^2 + (0-1)^2)=1.0. Reducing vertical height reduces axial force in m6. Keep member areas as is except consider increasing member_5 area from '1' to '2' if stress still high.",
  
  "calculation": "Set node_5 to (2.0, 1.0). Keep member areas same. Expect member_6 stress to reduce due to shorter vertical length and better force distribution. Member_5 area from '1' to '2' to reduce stress from -23.5674 closer to limit. Mass increase estimated: member_5 length ~3.162, area increase from 0.195 to 0.782 adds ~3*0.587=1.76 mass approx, total mass ~12.2 still under 30. Max stress expected to reduce below 23.57.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_5 moved vertically down to 1.0, member_5 area increased to 2. Other nodes fixed. Members unchanged. Constraints satisfied. Mass under 30, max stress expected reduced. Further optimization possible but diminishing returns.",
