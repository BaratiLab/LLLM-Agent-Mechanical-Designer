Member_3 stress high at 24.92 tensile, member_4 moderately stressed. Node_5 lowered to 0.85 y to reduce stress in member_5, but mass increased due to area 3 in member_5. Members with area 3 and 2 contribute significantly to mass. Load at node_3 causes tension in member_3 and compression in member_5. Node_3 and node_4 fixed, only node_5 movable. To reduce max stress, better distribute forces by adjusting node_5 y upwards slightly and reducing cross-sectional area of some members if possible.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_5 area 3 (1.759) is large, its length ~3.2 (between node_3 and node_4). Member_3 area 1 (0.195) is small but stress high. Member_1 and 2 have areas 3 and 2 respectively, with moderate compression. Consider reducing member_5 area from 3 to 1 or 2 to save mass and reduce stress. Node_5 y can be raised from 0.85 to about 1.1 to reduce stress in members connected to it. This may redistribute load better.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Raising node_5 y will reduce compression in member_5 and tension in member_8, balancing stresses. Reducing member_5 area from 3 to 2 reduces mass and stress capacity, but stress is low (-3.4478), so it can handle smaller area. Member_3 area 1 is sufficient. Member_1 area 3 is needed due to compression -6.4498. Member_2 area 2 is adequate. Members 6,7,8 area 1 is fine given stresses. Recalculate lengths and masses to verify total mass <30. Check max stress after changes.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: member_5 length = dist(node_3, node_4) = sqrt((2-2)^2 + (3-3)^2)=3.0 (fixed). Actually node_3 at (2,0), node_4 at (2,3), length=3.0. Member_5 length fixed. Member_8 length = dist(node_3, node_5). Move node_5 from y=0.85 to y=1.1 increases length slightly. Member masses proportional to length × area. Total mass recalculated after area and node_5 y change.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Change node_5 y from 0.85 to 1.1. Change member_5 area from \'3\' (1.759) to \'2\' (0.782). Member_5 mass reduces approx by half (from 5.277 to ~2.34). Node_5 to node_3 length increases from sqrt((2-2)^2+(0-0.85)^2)=0.85 to sqrt((2-2)^2+(0-1.1)^2)=1.1, member_8 length increases slightly. Total mass recalculated: sum previous mass - old member_5 mass + new member_5 mass + small increase in member_8 mass. New total mass ~ 14.988 - 5.277 + 2.34 + (0.1658 * 1.1/0.85) ~ 12.2 < 30.
