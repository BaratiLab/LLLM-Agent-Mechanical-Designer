Current max stress 52.38 > 30 limit, mass 14.38 < 30 limit. Need to reduce max stress by redesign or member sizing.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has a large stress in member_1 (-52.38 compressive) due to small area (0.195) and geometry. Member_2 is large area (3), but low stress. Members connecting top node_4 have moderate stress. The load induces high compression in member_1. The layout is asymmetric with node_3 between supports on baseline. The load is at node_3 at baseline, with node_4 above node_3. To reduce stress, better load path and member sizing needed. Possibly add node(s) to distribute forces and reduce member length/stress. Current member_1 is short and highly stressed; increasing area or adding intermediate nodes to reduce stress is needed. Mass is acceptable, so we can increase areas selectively.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding one node above node_3 to form a triangular truss with supports, improving force distribution. Increase areas on highly stressed members. Remove or reduce areas on low-stress members to keep mass low. Avoid moving fixed nodes. Use precise float coordinates.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node (node_5) above node_3 at (2.0, 1.5) to create two triangular sub-trusses. Connect node_5 to node_1, node_2, and node_3. Increase area of member_1 from 0.195 to 1.759 (area_id \'3\'), reduce member_2 area to 0.782 (area_id \'2\'), assign moderate areas to new members. Remove or reduce area of member_5 to reduce mass. This should balance compressive stresses and reduce max stress below 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 creates two triangles sharing the load at node_3, distributing forces better and reducing compression in member_1. Increasing area of member_1 reduces stress by increasing capacity. Reducing area of member_2 reduces mass since its stress is low. New members from node_5 to supports and node_3 provide alternative load paths. Member areas selected from given discrete area set to satisfy stress and mass constraints.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3: 2.0m; node_3-node_5: 1.5m; node_5-node_1: sqrt(2^2 + 1.5^2)=2.5m; node_5-node_2: sqrt((6-2)^2+1.5^2)=4.27m; node_3-node_2: 4m; node_5-node_3: 1.5m. Calculate mass = sum(length*area). Target max stress <=30. Use areas: member_1(3), member_2(2), member_3(1), member_4(1), member_5(1), new members (1). Estimated total mass ~ under 30. Expected max stress reduced by load sharing.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Mass approx: member_1: 2.0*1.759=3.52; member_2:4*0.782=3.13; member_3: node_1-node_4=3m*0.195=0.585; member_4: node_2-node_4=3m*0.195=0.585; member_5: node_3-node_4=3m*0.195=0.585; new members: node_5-node_1=2.5*0.195=0.49; node_5-node_2=4.27*0.195=0.83; node_3-node_5=1.5*0.195=0.29; Total ~9.5 < 30.
