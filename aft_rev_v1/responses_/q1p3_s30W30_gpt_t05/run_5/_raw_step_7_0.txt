Node_5 is only free node to move. Member_5 stress is -29.31 (compressive), critical member. Area sizes chosen mostly minimal except member_1 and member_2 have larger areas.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_5 (node_3-node_4) has stress -29.31 close to compressive limit. To reduce stress, can increase length of member_5 or redistribute forces by adjusting node_5 position. Node_5 currently at y=0.9, moving it vertically affects internal force distribution. Load applied at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Mass is acceptable, so focus on stress reduction. Areas mostly minimal except members 1,2,3. Member_3 area=2, member_1=3, member_2=2. Member_5 area=1 minimal, increasing area would increase mass unnecessarily. Better to optimize geometry.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try lowering node_5 closer to node_3 (y=0) or slightly increasing y to redistribute forces. Also consider slight horizontal shift of node_5 to reduce compressive stress in member_5. Must keep node_5 inside truss polygon to maintain closed structure. Avoid increasing mass by keeping areas same.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Moving node_5 down from 0.9 to ~0.7-0.8 may reduce compressive stress on member_5 by changing force paths. Horizontal shift of node_5 slightly right (x>2.0) could reduce member_5 compression by increasing member_8 length and changing force distribution. Keep member areas same to keep mass low. Member_3 area is 2, can keep. Members 6,7,8 area=1 minimal. Member_1 area=3 and member_2 area=2 are large to handle main tension/compression forces. Node_5 movement must not violate constraints or cause instability.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_5 = (2.0, 0.9). Try node_5 = (2.1, 0.75) to increase member_8 length and reduce member_5 compression. Check member lengths and estimate stress impact. Member_5 length = distance(node_3, node_4) fixed (2,0)-(2,3)=3. Member_8 length = distance(node_3, node_5) = currently sqrt((2-2)^2 + (0-0.9)^2)=0.9, new length sqrt((2-2.1)^2+(0-0.75)^2)=sqrt(0.01+0.5625)=~0.75. Actually shorter, so better to move node_5 left? Moving node_5 left to (1.9,0.75) makes member_8 length = sqrt((2-1.9)^2+(0-0.75)^2)=sqrt(0.01+0.5625)=0.75 shorter again. So vertical move down reduces member_8 length, may increase stress there. Alternatively, move node_5 up slightly to 1.0 or 1.1 to increase member_8 length, reduce stress on member_5. But previous iterations showed max stress increased at 1.1. So try node_5 = (2.0, 0.8), a slight reduction from 0.9, to reduce member_5 compression by adjusting force path. Member_3 area increased from 1 to 2 in last step reduced stress from 24.92 to 5.85, so keep area 2 for member_3. Member_1 and member_2 areas are large enough. Mass will remain under limit.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Set node_5 = (2.0, 0.8). Member areas unchanged. Member_5 length fixed 3. Member_8 length = 0.8. Member_5 stress expected to reduce from -29.31 to ~-25 to -27. Max stress targeted under 28. Total mass estimated ~12.0-12.5. Constraints met. Closed truss maintained. No duplicate nodes or members. Load/support nodes unchanged. No increase in member areas to keep mass low. This should improve stress distribution and keep max stress below limit.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Final node positions: node_1 (0.0,0.0), node_2 (6.0,0.0), node_3 (2.0,0.0), node_4 (2.0,3.0), node_5 (2.0,0.8).
