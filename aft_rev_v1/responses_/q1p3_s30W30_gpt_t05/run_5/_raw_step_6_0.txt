Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_5 moved in previous steps, member areas mostly small to medium.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress is mainly on member_3 (node_1-node_4) tension 22.32 and member_6 (node_5-node_1) compression 11.62. Member_3 area is minimal (area_id=1, 0.195). Increasing area there may reduce stress. Node_5 vertical position affects stress distribution; currently at y=1.1. Members connected to node_5 show moderate stress. Node_3 and node_4 fixed in x=2.0, y=0 and y=3.0 respectively. Node_1 and node_2 fixed at base supports. Member_5 (node_3-node_4) area 2 with moderate compression stress -6.95. Member_1 and member_2 large areas (3 and 2) with low stresses. The structure is stable but stress can be better balanced by adjusting node_5 y-position and slightly increasing area of critical members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider increasing area of member_3 from 1(0.195) to 2(0.782) to reduce stress. Also, move node_5 down slightly from 1.1 to around 0.9 to reduce tension in member_3 and compression in member_6. Check mass impact. Possibly reduce area of low stress members (member_5) if mass allows.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Increasing member_3 area reduces stress by increasing cross-section. Moving node_5 down reduces lever arm effect on member_3 and redistributes forces, lowering max stress. Member_5 area can be reduced from 2(0.782) to 1(0.195) to save mass and offset increase from member_3. Member_6 and member_7 areas kept to 1 to maintain stability. Node_5 y-position is free to move as per instructions. All other nodes fixed due to loads/supports. This approach balances stress, keeps mass under limits, and maintains closed truss topology.", \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member_3 length approx sqrt((2-0)^2 + (3-0)^2) = sqrt(4+9)=3.605. Area increase from 0.195 to 0.782 increases mass by factor ~4. Member_5 length ~3.0 (node_3 to node_4 vertical). Reducing its area saves mass. Node_5 y from 1.1 to 0.9 reduces member_3 tension and member_6 compression. Total mass estimated after changes ~12.5 < 30, max stress expected < 22.",\n\n  "calculation": "Change member_3 area from \'1\' to \'2\'. Change member_5 area from \'2\' to \'1\'. Move node_5 from (2.0, 1.1) to (2.0, 0.9). Member lengths: member_3 ~3.605, member_5 ~3.0. Mass member_3 new approx 3.605*0.782=2.82 (up from 0.7031). Mass member_5 new approx 3.0*0.195=0.585 (down from 2.346). Net mass increase ~ +0.6, total ~12.7 still within limits.
