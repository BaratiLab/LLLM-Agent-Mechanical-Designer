Max stress ±30, max mass 30. Current max stress 30.53 slightly exceeded, mass 12.397 well below limit. Need to reduce stress on member_5 (-30.5251).",\n\n  "analysis": "Current design has stress exceeding limit on member_5 (node_3-node_4). Member_5 area is 1 (smallest). Increasing area on that member will increase mass but reduce stress. Alternatively, redistribute load by adding a node higher than node_4 to reduce force in member_5. Current node_5 at (2,0.8) is low; raising it or adding a node above node_4 can help. Also, member_3 area is 2, member_1 area is 3, member_2 area 2. Member_5 area 1 is minimal but stressed. Mass is low, so some increase in cross-sectional areas is acceptable.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_6 above node_4 at (2.0, 4.0) to create a better load path. Connect node_6 to node_4, node_1, and node_2 to form a truss triangle. Increase area of member_5 to 2 or 3 to reduce stress. Possibly increase area of members connected to node_6 to 1 or 2 to balance. This should reduce stress on member_5 and keep mass under 30.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add node_6 at (2.0, 4.0). Connect node_6 to node_4, node_1, and node_2. Increase member_5 area to 2. Adjust areas of new members to 1 or 2. Keep other members as is or slightly increase if needed. This will redistribute load and reduce stress on member_5.",\n\n  "reasoning": "By adding node_6 above node_4, the load path from node_3 to supports is improved, reducing stress on member_5. Increasing member_5 area reduces its stress. New members from node_6 provide alternate load paths, reducing peak stress. The mass increase is acceptable as total mass remains below 30. This approach balances stress and mass constraints effectively.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_4-node_6 = 1.0, node_1-node_6 = sqrt(2^2 + 4^2) = 4.4721, node_2-node_6 = sqrt((6-2)^2 + 4^2) = 5.6569. Areas chosen to keep mass reasonable. Expect stress reduction on member_5 from increased area and alternate paths.",\n\n  "calculation": "Mass estimate: Existing mass 12.397 + new members mass. New members: member_9 (node_4-node_6): length 1.0 × area 1 = 1.0, member_10 (node_1-node_6): length 4.4721 × area 1 = 4.4721, member_11 (node_2-node_6): length 5.6569 × area 1 = 5.6569. Total new mass = 11.129. Total estimated mass = 12.397 + 11.129 = 23.526 < 30. Stress on member_5 reduced by doubling area to 2, expected max stress ~15. Max stress now below 30.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "New node and members added, areas adjusted to reduce max stress below 30 and keep total mass under 30. Load path improved.
