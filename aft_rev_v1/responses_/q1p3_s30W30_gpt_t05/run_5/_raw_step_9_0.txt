Current max stress 12.89, mass 16.33, well within constraints.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress is significantly below ±30 limit, and total mass is about half the maximum allowed. Members have moderate areas, nodes fixed for load/support, and added node_6 improves load distribution. Stress distribution is balanced with no member near limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further reducing stress would likely require increased mass or complex geometry changes. Current design uses efficient member layout and areas, with no overstressed members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Given constraints and current results, further optimization would yield diminishing returns. Mass is moderate; reducing stress more would increase mass or complexity. Node positions for load/support fixed, and additional node_6 added to improve load path. Member areas are chosen to balance stress and mass. No members exceed stress limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress and mass calculated from member lengths and assigned areas. Member areas selected from given discrete set. Node_5 and node_6 placed to optimize force flow. Current max stress at 12.89 is less than half allowable. Total mass 16.33 is much less than max 30.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Verify member stresses and masses sum correctly. Member_5 area 2 (0.782) and length yields 2.346 mass, consistent. Total mass sum 16.3282 < 30. Max stress 12.89 < 30. No violations. Node_6 added at y=4.0 improves stability and decreases max stress compared to previous iteration. Member connections maintain closed truss. No duplicate nodes or members. Load/support nodes fixed.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints satisfied. Max stress well below limit.
