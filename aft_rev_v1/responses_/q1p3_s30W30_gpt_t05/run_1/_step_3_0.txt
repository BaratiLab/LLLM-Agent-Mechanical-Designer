  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under given load/supports, respecting stress ±30 and mass ≤30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 (-10N, -45°), supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller. Current max stress slightly exceeds 30 (30.16), mass 12.9 well below 30. Need to reduce max stress in member_4 slightly.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design has node_4 at y=1.75m with members mostly area 3 and 1. Member_4 stress is 30.1565, just over limit. Mass is low, so slight area increase or geometry tweak can reduce stress. Node_3 is fixed at x=2.0, y=0.0, nodes 1 and 2 fixed at base. Member_4 (node_4 to node_2) is critical. Increasing node_4 height slightly or increasing area of member_4 can reduce stress.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Slight increase in node_4 y (e.g. 1.85) can reduce member_4 axial stress. Keep member_1,3,5 area=3, member_2 area=1 (lowest). Increase member_4 area from 1 to 2 or 3 to reduce stress. Check mass impact. Avoid adding nodes to keep simplicity.",
  
  "proposal": "Move node_4 from y=1.75 to y=1.85, increase member_4 area from 1 to 2. Keep other members same areas. This reduces stress on member_4 and keeps mass below 30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Increasing height of node_4 reduces axial force in member_4 by increasing its length and changing force angles, reducing stress. Increasing member_4 area reduces stress by increasing cross-sectional area. Other members are within limits. Mass increase is small and total mass stays under 30.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate new length member_4: sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0 - 1.85)^2) = sqrt(16 + 3.4225) = sqrt(19.4225) ≈ 4.407 m. Old length: sqrt(16 + 3.0625)= sqrt(19.0625)=4.366 m. Slight length increase. Member_4 mass = length × area. Area 2 = 0.782. Mass member_4 = 4.407 × 0.782 = 3.446 kg approx (old mass was 0.8514 at area 1). But previous area 1 mass was 0.8514, but length was 4.366, so area 1 is 0.195, so mass = 4.366×0.195=0.8514 matches. So new mass is 4.407×0.782=3.446 kg. Increase in mass ~2.6 kg. Total mass old 12.9022 + 2.6 - old member_4 mass 0.8514 = approx 14.65 kg total, still under 30. Stress reduction expected from geometry and area increase.",
  
  "calculation": "Member lengths: member_1: 2.0m, member_2: 4.0m, member_3: node_1 to node_4: sqrt(2^2 + 1.85^2) = sqrt(4+3.4225)=2.71m, member_5: node_3 to node_4: 1.85m. Areas: member_1=3 (1.759), member_2=1 (0.195), member_3=3 (1.759), member_4=2 (0.782), member_5=3 (1.759). Masses: m1=2×1.759=3.518, m2=4×0.195=0.78, m3=2.71×1.759=4.768, m4=4.407×0.782=3.446, m5=1.85×1.759=3.252. Total mass=3.518+0.78+4.768+3.446+3.252=15.764 kg <30. Stress expected to drop below 30 due to increased area and geometry.",
