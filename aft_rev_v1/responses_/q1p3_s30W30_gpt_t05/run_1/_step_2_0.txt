  "preamble": "Optimize truss by reducing max stress, adjusting node_4 vertically to balance forces.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 27.03 < 30, total mass 13.66 < 30; node_4 moved down from y=3 to y=2 reduced stress but mass increased; member areas mostly 3 or 1.",
  "analysis": "Max stress is from member_4 (27.028) near limit; member_2 also high compression (-24.17). Lowering node_4 reduced member_4 stress but increased mass. Need to reduce stress on member_4 and member_2 while keeping mass under 30. Node_4 can only move vertically; load/support nodes fixed. Members connect node_4 to node_2 and node_1, and node_3 to node_4. Member_4 is long diagonal from node_4 to node_2. Shortening or changing geometry to reduce tension in member_4 is key.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try lowering node_4 slightly below 2.0 to reduce member_4 tension, but not too low to increase member_3 or member_1 stress. Possibly shift node_4 to ~1.7-1.8 y to balance. Keep node_3 at (2,0). Maintain member areas as is or reduce area for high stress members if stress reduces.",
  "reasoning": "Member_4 stress is tensile and high; lowering node_4 reduces length and tension. Member_2 compression is high; geometry change may reduce compression force. Member_1 and member_3 stresses are moderate. Area 3 (1.759) is high; consider reducing area if stress allows. But priority is geometry optimization first. Load at node_3 is downward-left (-10, -45°). Node_4 vertical adjustment affects force path and member stresses.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Check length of member_4: distance between node_4 (2, y4) and node_2 (6,0) = sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0 - y4)^2) = sqrt(16 + y4^2). Lower y4 reduces length and tension force. Member_2 length fixed (node_3 to node_2). Member_5 length depends on node_4 y-position. Lowering y4 may increase member_5 length but stress is moderate. Try y4=1.75 as trial.",
  "calculation": "Set node_4 at (2, 1.75). Length member_4 = sqrt(16 + 1.75^2) = sqrt(16 + 3.0625) = sqrt(19.0625) ≈ 4.366. Previously at y=2 length was sqrt(16+4)=4.472. Slightly shorter. Expect member_4 stress to reduce proportionally. Member_5 length = distance node_3 (2,0) to node_4 (2,1.75) = 1.75, shorter than before (2.0). Member_1 length unchanged (node_1 to node_3). Mass recalculated with same areas: member_4 mass = length * area = 4.366 * 1.759 = 7.68 (previous 0.8721? Seems previous area id 1 for member_4, area=0.195, now area 1). Adjust member_4 area to 1 (0.195) to reduce mass and stress. Member_2 area 1 (0.195) same. Member_1,3,5 keep area 3 (1.759). Total mass approx sum(length × area): member_1 length=2 (0 to 2), mass=2*1.759=3.518; member_2 length=4 (2 to 6), mass=4*0.195=0.78; member_3 length= sqrt(2^2 + 1.75^2) ≈ 2.66, mass=2.66*1.759=4.68; member_4 mass=4.366*0.195=0.851; member_5 length=1.75, mass=1.75*1.759=3.08; total mass approx 3.518+0.78+4.68+0.851+3.08=12.91 < 13.66 previous, under 30 constraint. Expect max stress reduced from 27.03 to ~24-25.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved to (2,1.75), member_4 area reduced to 1 to reduce mass and stress, others unchanged. Geometry change should reduce max stress below previous 27.03, mass reduced. Constraints satisfied.",
