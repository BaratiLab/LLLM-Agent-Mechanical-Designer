Increasing area on member_2 is limited by mass and stress constraints. Member_4 (node_4-node_2) with area 0.782 (area_id=2) has low stress, so increasing its area can help redistribute forces. Node_4 height is 1.5, which is low; increasing height can reduce axial forces in horizontal members. The design can be improved by raising node_4 slightly and adjusting member areas to reduce stress on member_2.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increase node_4 y-coordinate to ~2.0 for better load path.
