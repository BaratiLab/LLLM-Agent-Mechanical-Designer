Stress well balanced, no member near stress limit.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "No member stress close to ±30, no mass limit exceeded. Further reduction in stress may increase mass or complicate geometry. Current simple 4-node truss with 5 members is efficient.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Minimizing stress further would require increasing member areas or changing geometry. Increasing areas increases mass beyond current 21.05 but still under 30. Changing node_4 position or adding nodes risks complexity without clear benefit. Current stress distribution is low and uniform. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_4 at y=2.0 optimal balance between height and member force distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas produce current mass; stress depends on geometry and load.
