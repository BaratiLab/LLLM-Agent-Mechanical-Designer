Current max stress 30.9 exceeds ±30 limit. Total mass 15.1 < 30, so mass is acceptable. Members mostly area_id 3 and 1 or 2. Member_4 stress is 30.9, slightly over limit, needs redesign or area increase.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has node_4 at (2.0,1.7) connected to node_1 and node_2. Member_4 (node_4-node_2) has max stress 30.9, slightly exceeding limit. Member_2 area is 2, member_4 area is 1. Member_4 is shortest member (length ~4.0), but under high stress. Increasing area of member_4 or redistributing forces by node reposition or adding a new node can reduce stress. Current structure is a simple triangular truss with a vertical node_4. The load at node_3 is downward-left, so members connecting node_3 to node_4 and node_4 to node_2 carry significant load. Increasing area of member_4 is limited by mass. Adding an intermediate node between node_4 and node_2 to reduce stress concentration can help. Alternatively, reposition node_4 slightly closer to node_2 to reduce member_4 length and stress. Also, increasing member_4 area from 1 to 2 or 3 may help but adds mass. Member_2 area can be reduced to save mass. Member_5 area can be reduced to 2 or 1 to save mass. Overall, slight node_4 y decrease and member area adjustment can reduce max stress below 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member lengths: node_4-node_2 approx sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-1.7)^2)=sqrt(16+2.89)=~4.22. Reducing node_4 y from 1.7 to 1.5 reduces length to ~4.27. Slightly longer but may redistribute forces. Increase member_4 area from 1 to 2 (0.195 to 0.782) increases mass by ~0.6 but reduces stress. Reduce member_2 area from 2 to 1 to save mass. Reduce member_5 area from 3 to 2 to save mass. Total mass approx recalculated to remain under 30.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep nodes_1,2,3 fixed.

Reducing member_2 and member_5 areas compensates mass increase. This balances stress and mass within constraints. Member_4 stress expected to drop below 30. Member_2 stress reduced by smaller area but load reduced by geometry. Member_5 area reduction saves mass. The triangular truss with these modifications maintains stability and load path. No new nodes added, keeping design simple and efficient.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: member_4 length = sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-1.5)^2) = sqrt(16 + 2.25) = sqrt(18.25) ≈ 4.27.
