  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to satisfy max stress ±30 and total mass ≤ 30 with given loads and supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 downward-left (-10N at -45°). Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current max stress exceeds 30 (member_2: -32.23). Total mass 13.2 < 30, so mass is acceptable. Need to reduce member_2 stress and keep others ≤30.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design puts high compressive stress on member_2 (node_3-node_2) with area 0.195 (area_id=1). Increasing area on member_2 is limited by mass and stress constraints. Member_4 (node_4-node_2) with area 0.782 (area_id=2) has low stress, so increasing its area can help redistribute forces. Node_4 height is 1.5, which is low; increasing height can reduce axial forces in horizontal members. The design can be improved by raising node_4 slightly and adjusting member areas to reduce stress on member_2.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Increase node_4 y-coordinate to ~2.0 for better load path. Increase member_2 area to 0.782 (area_id=2). Increase member_4 area to 1.759 (area_id=3). Keep member_1 and member_3 at 1.759 (area_id=3) for stability. Member_5 (node_3-node_4) area at 0.782 (area_id=2) to balance forces. Check mass and stress after these changes.",
  
  "proposal": "Raise node_4 to (2.0, 2.0). Set member areas: member_1=3, member_2=2, member_3=3, member_4=3, member_5=2. Members: \nmember_1: node_1-node_3 area 3 (1.759)\nmember_2: node_3-node_2 area 2 (0.782)\nmember_3: node_1-node_4 area 3 (1.759)\nmember_4: node_4-node_2 area 3 (1.759)\nmember_5: node_3-node_4 area 2 (0.782)",
  
  "reasoning": "Increasing node_4 height reduces horizontal compression in member_2 by redirecting load through diagonal members. Increasing member_2 area reduces stress in critical member. Increasing member_4 area helps carry more load from node_4 to node_2. Member_5 supports load transfer between node_3 and node_4. Member_1 and member_3 maintain support stability. Total mass remains under 30. Stress expected to be balanced below ±30.",

  "calculation": "Estimated mass 20.946 < 30 OK.\nExpected max stress < 30 due to increased areas and better load path.\nMember_2 stress reduced by area increase and node_4 height.\nMember_4 area increase helps transfer load, reducing stress on member_2.\nNo changes to support and load nodes.\nNo duplicate nodes or members.",
