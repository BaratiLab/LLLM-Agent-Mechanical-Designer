  "preamble": "Current structure meets constraints with low max stress.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives: minimize max stress <= ±30, mass <= 30. Current max stress 9.04, mass 21.05. Constraints satisfied.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design has max stress well below limit (9.04 << 30) and mass below max allowed (21.05 < 30). Members sized mostly at area 3 (1.759) and 2 (0.782). Node_4 moved back to 2.0 height improving stress distribution. Load and supports fixed. Stress well balanced, no member near stress limit.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "No member stress close to ±30, no mass limit exceeded. Further reduction in stress may increase mass or complicate geometry. Current simple 4-node truss with 5 members is efficient.",
  
  "reasoning": "Minimizing stress further would require increasing member areas or changing geometry. Increasing areas increases mass beyond current 21.05 but still under 30. Changing node_4 position or adding nodes risks complexity without clear benefit. Current stress distribution is low and uniform. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_4 at y=2.0 optimal balance between height and member force distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas produce current mass; stress depends on geometry and load. Areas chosen from given set. Further optimization unlikely to reduce max stress significantly without adding mass or complicating structure. Constraints satisfied with margin.",
  
  "calculation": "Member lengths approx: m1 (node1-node3): 2.0, m2 (node3-node2): 4.0, m3 (node1-node4): 2.828, m4 (node4-node2): 4.472, m5 (node3-node4): 2.0. Areas per member: m1=3 (1.759), m2=2 (0.782), m3=3 (1.759), m4=3 (1.759), m5=2 (0.782). Mass sum ~21.05 < 30. Max stress 9.04 well below 30. Load and support fixed. Node_4 at (2.0, 2.0).",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met with margin, no violation. Further optimization risks complexity or mass increase. Stop optimization here.",
