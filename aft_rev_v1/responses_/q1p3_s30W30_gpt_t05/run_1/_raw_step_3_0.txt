Current max stress slightly exceeds 30 (30.16), mass 12.9 well below 30. Need to reduce max stress in member_4 slightly.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has node_4 at y=1.75m with members mostly area 3 and 1. Member_4 stress is 30.1565, just over limit. Mass is low, so slight area increase or geometry tweak can reduce stress. Node_3 is fixed at x=2.0, y=0.0, nodes 1 and 2 fixed at base. Member_4 (node_4 to node_2) is critical. Increasing node_4 height slightly or increasing area of member_4 can reduce stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Slight increase in node_4 y (e.g. 1.85) can reduce member_4 axial stress. Keep member_1,3,5 area=3, member_2 area=1 (lowest). Increase member_4 area from 1 to 2 or 3 to reduce stress. Check mass impact. Avoid adding nodes to keep simplicity.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Move node_4 from y=1.75 to y=1.85, increase member_4 area from 1 to 2. Keep other members same areas. This reduces stress on member_4 and keeps mass below 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing height of node_4 reduces axial force in member_4 by increasing its length and changing force angles, reducing stress. Increasing member_4 area reduces stress by increasing cross-sectional area. Other members are within limits. Mass increase is small and total mass stays under 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate new length member_4: sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0 - 1.85)^2) = sqrt(16 + 3.4225) = sqrt(19.4225) ≈ 4.407 m. Old length: sqrt(16 + 3.0625)= sqrt(19.0625)=4.366 m. Slight length increase. Member_4 mass = length × area. Area 2 = 0.782. Mass member_4 = 4.407 × 0.782 = 3.446 kg approx (old mass was 0.8514 at area 1). But previous area 1 mass was 0.8514, but length was 4.366, so area 1 is 0.195, so mass = 4.366×0.195=0.8514 matches. So new mass is 4.407×0.782=3.446 kg. Increase in mass ~2.6 kg. Total mass old 12.9022 + 2.6 - old member_4 mass 0.8514 = approx 14.65 kg total, still under 30.
