Need closed truss (all nodes connected). Constraints: max stress ±30, mass ≤30. Areas discrete from 0:1 to 10:19.548. Load is downward-left at node_3. Node_3 is on base line, so adding nodes above to form stable truss is beneficial.",\n  \n  "analysis": "To form closed truss with 3 nodes, all connected, simplest closed shape is triangle. Current nodes are colinear along x-axis (0,0), (2,0), (6,0). Triangular truss requires non-colinear third node. Must add at least one new node above baseline to form triangle and distribute load. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) fix boundary. Load at node_3 is downward-left, so truss must resist bending and shear. Adding node_4 above node_3 creates two triangles: node_1-node_4-node_3 and node_3-node_4-node_2, forming closed shape. Use minimal area members to keep mass low, increase area in high stress members. Approximate stress by method of joints; assume axial forces only. Mass = sum(length × area).",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) above node_3 for stability.
