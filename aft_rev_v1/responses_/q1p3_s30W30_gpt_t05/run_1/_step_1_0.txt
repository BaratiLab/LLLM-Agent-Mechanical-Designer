  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position and member areas to reduce max stress under 30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress is 29.05 (member_3), close to limit. Mass 6.3681 well below 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 can move vertically/horizontally to reduce stress in member_3 and others.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_3 (node_1-node_4) has max tensile stress near limit, likely due to vertical position of node_4 at 3.0. Members around node_4 also under moderate stress. Member_5 (node_3-node_4) compressive stress is moderate. Member_1 and member_2 compressive stresses moderate. Member_4 tensile stress moderate. Areas currently: member_1=2(0.782), member_2=1(0.195), member_3=1(0.195), member_4=1(0.195), member_5=2(0.782).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing area of member_3 or reducing length by lowering node_4 might reduce stress. Also, adjusting node_4 horizontally closer to node_2 or node_3 could balance forces better. Mass budget is large, so increasing areas is feasible if it reduces stress.",
  
  "reasoning": "To reduce max stress in member_3, either reduce force or increase area. Increasing area from 1(0.195) to 2(0.782) or 3(1.759) will reduce stress by factor of area ratio. Alternatively, moving node_4 down from 3.0 to ~2.0 reduces member length and force. Moving node_4 horizontally towards node_2 (6,0) may reduce bending moments and redistribute forces. Also, increasing area of member_5 and member_1 can help reduce compressive stresses. Member_2 area is small, but stress is moderate. Keep mass under 30 is easy; current mass 6.3681 is low.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculations: member_3 length = distance(node_1,node_4) = sqrt((0-2)^2 + (0-3)^2)=3.605. Reducing node_4 y to 2 reduces length to sqrt(4+4)=2.828. Stress inversely proportional to area. Current area for member_3 is 0.195. Increasing to 0.782 reduces stress roughly by factor 4. Member_5 length ~ sqrt((2-2)^2 + (3-0)^2)=3.0. Adjusting node_4 will affect member_5 length and stress.",
  
  "calculation": "Move node_4 from (2.0, 3.0) to (2.0, 2.0). Increase member_3 area from '1' (0.195) to '3' (1.759). Increase member_5 area from '2' (0.782) to '3' (1.759) to reduce compressive stress. Keep other members same or slightly adjust member_1 area from '2' to '3' to reduce compressive stress. Member_2 and member_4 can remain at area '1' (0.195). Estimate new mass: member_3 length 2.828 * 1.759 = 4.97, member_5 length ~3.0 *1.759=5.28, member_1 length ~2.0 *1.759=3.5, member_2 length ~4.0 *0.195=0.78, member_4 length ~6.32 *0.195=1.23. Total mass ~15.77 < 30, acceptable.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 lowered reduces length and force in member_3, increasing area reduces stress further. Increasing member_5 and member_1 areas reduces compressive stresses. Member_2 and member_4 remain small area to save mass. All constraints met. Max stress expected below 30. Stop=False to allow next iteration if needed.",
