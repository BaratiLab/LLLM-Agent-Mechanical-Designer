Load at node_3, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_4 moved upward to 2.4 improves stress. Areas mostly 2 or 3. Objective is to reduce max stress further by small nodal adjustments and area optimization.",\n\n  "analysis": "Max stress is low and balanced in tension and compression. Member_3 is highest compression (-9.28), members_1 and 5 tension (8.8 and -6.87). Current areas are 2 for most members except member_5 area 3. Mass is moderate. Node_4 at (2.55, 2.4) is above node_3 (2,0). Small vertical shifts or slight horizontal shifts of node_4 might reduce stress. Reducing area of member_5 from 3 to 2 may reduce mass without increasing stress beyond limits. Member connections form a closed truss with 4 nodes and 5 members, minimal but stable.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try lowering node_4 slightly to reduce compressive stress in member_3 and tension in member_1. Consider reducing member_5 area from 3 to 2 to reduce mass. Member_4 and 2 are at area 2, possibly increase member_4 to area 3 to redistribute forces if needed. Check if slight horizontal shift of node_4 right/left improves stress. Avoid moving load/support nodes.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Lowering node_4 reduces length of members connected to it, potentially reducing stress. Member_5 area can be reduced to 2 since its stress is moderate (-6.87). Member_1 and 3 are critical, keep areas at 2 to maintain strength. Member_4 area can be increased to 3 for better load transfer. Node_4 horizontal position near 2.55 is good; small adjustments ±0.1 m might help. Balancing tension and compression through area distribution and nodal position is key.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approx: m1 ~ sqrt((2.55)^2 + (2.4)^2)=3.51m, m3 ~ sqrt((0.55)^2 + (2.4)^2)=2.47m, m5 = 2m. Areas: current 2 or 3. Mass = sum(length * area). Max stress target < 9. Current max 9.28, try to reduce to ~8. Node_4 move down to ~2.3 y, keep x ~2.55.
