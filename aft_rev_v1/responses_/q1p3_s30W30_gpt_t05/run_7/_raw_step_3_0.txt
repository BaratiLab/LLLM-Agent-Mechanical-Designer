Member_3 tensile stress 10.13. Member_2 and member_4 stresses low. Total mass 19.67 is moderate. Node_4 moved from (3.0,2.5) to (2.7,2.0) decreased max stress from ~18.88 to 17.18. Further reducing compressive stress in member_1 and member_5 is key. Load node_3 and supports fixed.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try moving node_4 slightly left and down to reduce compressive stress in member_1 and member_5.

Increasing their cross-sectional area reduces stress. Moving node_4 closer to node_1 reduces length and force in member_1. Moving node_4 downward reduces axial force in member_5. Keep member_2 and member_4 areas moderate to save mass. Node_3 fixed at (2.0,0.0). Node_4 position should be optimized within y=[1.5,2.0] and x=[2.5,2.7] to balance forces.
