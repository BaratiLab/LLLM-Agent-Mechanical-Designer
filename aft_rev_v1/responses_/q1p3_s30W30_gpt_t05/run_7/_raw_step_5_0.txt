Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved slightly in previous iterations to reduce stress and mass.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Stress distribution is quite balanced with max stress ~9.77. Member areas mostly \'2\' except member_5 with \'3\'. Node_4 at (2.55, 2.0) seems reasonable, but small vertical adjustment may reduce stress further. Member_2 and member_1 have tensile stresses ~6-9.7, member_3 and member_4 compressive ~-5 to -9.4. Member_5 compressive ~-7.4. Mass is low, so increasing area selectively to reduce stress may help. The structure is closed and stable.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try slightly raising node_4 to reduce compression in member_3 and tension in member_1. Use area \'3\' for member_1 and member_3 to reduce stress. Consider reducing area of member_5 from \'3\' to \'2\' to save mass and compensate by slightly increasing member_1 and member_3 areas.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing node_4 height increases member_1 and member_2 lengths, potentially reducing tensile stress in member_1 and member_2 due to better force distribution. Increasing area of members with high stress reduces stress by increasing cross-sectional area. Reducing area of low stress members saves mass. Constraints allow mass up to 30, currently 13.9, so we can increase areas to reduce stress further. Node_3 and supports fixed. Node_4 can be moved vertically between 2.0 and 2.3 safely.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: member_1 ~ sqrt((2.55)^2 + (2.0)^2) ~ 3.28; member_3 ~ sqrt((0.55)^2 + (2.0)^2) ~ 2.07. Increasing node_4 y from 2.0 to 2.2 increases length and reduces stress. Area changes: member_1 and member_3 from \'2\'(0.782) to \'3\'(1.759) doubles area, stress halves approximately. Member_5 area from \'3\' to \'2\' saves mass ~1.36 units.",\n  \n  "calculation": "New node_4 = (2.55, 2.2). Update areas: member_1 and member_3 to \'3\', member_5 to \'2\', others remain \'2\'. Estimated mass increase for member_1 and member_3: (1.759 - 0.782) * length ~ (0.977) * 3.28 = 3.2 and (0.977) * 2.07 = 2.02 total ~5.22 increase. Mass decrease member_5: (1.759 - 0.782) * length(member_5) ~ 0.977 * length_1-3(4 units approx) = 3.9 mass saved. Net mass ~ 13.92 + 5.22 - 3.9 = 15.24 < 30 max. Stress reduction approx half for members_1 and 3, max stress reduces from 9.77 to ~5. This is favorable.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved up 0.2 units.
