Member_4 also high stress (20.15). Member_2 and 5 have low stress. Mass budget allows increasing area in critical members or repositioning node_4 to reduce stress. Currently, node_4 is at (2.0, 3.0). Moving node_4 slightly horizontally and vertically can improve force distribution and reduce stress in member_3 and 4. Increasing area in member_3 from 1.759 to 3.128 (area_id \'4\') will reduce stress but increases mass. To compensate, reduce area in low stress members or shorten members by repositioning node_4 closer to node_2 horizontally and slightly lower vertically.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_4 from (2.0,3.0) to approx (3.0,2.5) to redistribute forces.

Check stress balance after changes.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_3 highest tensile stress likely due to node_4 vertical position causing large axial force. Moving node_4 closer to node_2 reduces lever arm, lowering force in member_3 and 4. Increasing cross-sectional area of member_3 reduces stress. Reducing area in member_5 (low stress) saves mass.
