  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to reduce max stress while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 18.88 < 30, mass 23.68 < 30, load at node_3, supports fixed. Goal: reduce stress further by adjusting free node_4 position and member areas.",
  "analysis": "Member_4 has highest tensile stress (18.88) with smallest area (0.195). Increasing its area can reduce stress. Member_1 has high compressive stress (-16.28). Node_4 moved from y=3.0 to 2.5 increased mass but reduced max stress from 29.05 to 18.88. Further optimization possible by repositioning node_4 to balance force paths and adjusting member areas.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Increase area of member_4 from '1' (0.195) to '2' (0.782) or '3' (1.759) to reduce stress. Move node_4 slightly left and down to reduce member_4 stress and balance stresses in members 3 and 5.",
  "reasoning": "Increasing member_4 area reduces its stress by increasing capacity. Moving node_4 closer to node_3 and slightly lower reduces lever arm, reducing stress in member_4 and member_3. Maintaining closed truss with 5 members is key. Avoid increasing mass over 30. Adjust member areas for optimal stress distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current areas: member_1=2(0.782), member_2=3(1.759), member_3=4(3.128), member_4=1(0.195), member_5=2(0.782). Proposed: member_4 area to 3(1.759), node_4 from (3.0,2.5) to approx (2.7,2.0). Recalculate member lengths and estimate mass and stress reduction.",
  "calculation": "Node_4 moved to (2.7, 2.0). Member lengths: m4 (node_4-node_2) length ~ sqrt((6-2.7)^2 + (0-2)^2)=sqrt(3.3^2+2^2)=~3.87. Mass m4=3.87*1.759=6.8 (was 0.76). Increase in mass offset by reducing member_3 area from 4(3.128) to 2(0.782), mass m3 length ~ sqrt((2.7-0)^2+(2-0)^2)=~3.4, m3 mass=3.4*0.782=2.66 (was 12.2). Net mass change reduces total mass. Stress in member_4 reduces due to larger area and shorter lever arm. Member_3 stress slightly increases but within limits.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New design keeps total mass ~23 (below 30), max stress expected < 18.88, closed truss maintained, no changes to load/support nodes, no duplicate nodes or members, areas selected from allowed set.",
