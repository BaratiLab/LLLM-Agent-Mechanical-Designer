Member_5 has highest compressive stress (-16.03). Aim to reduce stress by adjusting node_4 y-position and member areas.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Node_4 is free to move; increasing height tends to reduce compressive stress on bottom chord (member_5). Current member_5 area is 2 (0.782), relatively small. Increasing area on member_5 could reduce stress. Members 1 and 3 have area 3 (1.759). Member 2 and 4 have area 2 (0.782). Current configuration has balanced stresses but member_5 is critical. Increasing node_4 y slightly could reduce load on member_5. Also consider increasing member_5 area to 3 (1.759) to reduce stress further. Check mass impact.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try node_4 y=2.4 (increase from 2.2) to reduce bottom chord stress. Increase member_5 area to 3. Keep other areas same or reduce member_1 and 3 areas from 3 to 2 to compensate mass. This keeps total mass within limit and reduces max stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing node_4 height increases triangle height, reducing axial force in bottom chord (member_5). Increasing member_5 cross-section reduces stress directly. Reducing member_1 and 3 areas slightly compensates mass increase from member_5. Member_2 and 4 areas remain same to maintain stiffness. This balances mass and stress. Member lengths: member_1 and 3 are longer, so reducing their area reduces mass effectively.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member areas: member_5 from 2 (0.782) to 3 (1.759), member_1 and 3 from 3 (1.759) to 2 (0.782). Node_4 from (2.55, 2.2) to (2.55, 2.4). Calculate approximate mass change: member_5 length ~2.236, delta area = +0.977, mass increase ~2.236*0.977=2.18. member_1 length ~sqrt(2.55^2+2.4^2)=~3.5, area decrease 0.977, mass decrease ~3.5*0.977=3.42. member_3 similar length ~3.5, mass decrease similar. Total mass change ~2.18 - 3.42 - 3.42 = -4.66, net mass reduction. Max stress expected to reduce from 16.03 to ~12-14.",\n  \n  "calculation": "New node_4: (2.55, 2.4).
