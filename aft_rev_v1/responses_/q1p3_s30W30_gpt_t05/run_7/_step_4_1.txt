  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position and member areas to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 27.35 near limit Â±30; total mass 18.09 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed at nodes 1 and 2. Node_4 movable to optimize stress distribution.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_2 has highest tensile stress (27.35) with smallest area (area_id=1, 0.195). Increasing area here or adjusting geometry to reduce force in member_2 is needed. Members 1 and 5 have larger areas but moderate stress. Node_4 is low at y=1.7, increasing y may reduce stress in member_2 by better force path. Member_4 area is large (3) but low stress (-2.7), area can be reduced to save mass. Member_1 area is 3 with low stress (4.8), can reduce area to save mass. Member_3 area 2 moderate stress (-9.5), member_5 area 3 moderate stress (-8.0).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on increasing node_4 y-coordinate to reduce tensile stress in member_2 and redistribute forces. Reduce area of low-stress members (member_1, member_4) to save mass. Possibly increase area of member_2 to reduce stress. Maintain closed truss with 5 members and 4 nodes.",
  
  "reasoning": "Increasing node_4 y will increase length of member_2 reducing axial force and stress. Reducing area of members with low stress will reduce mass, allowing area increase in critical member_2. Area selection from provided discrete set. Must keep node_1 and node_2 fixed due to supports, node_3 fixed due to load. Move node_4 only. Member connections remain same for closed truss.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas: member_2 length = distance(node_4, node_2). Increasing node_4 y from 1.7 to ~2.0 should help. Area changes: member_2 area from 1 (0.195) to 2 (0.782) or 3 (1.759) to reduce stress. Reduce member_1 and member_4 area from 3 (1.759) to 1 (0.195) or 2 (0.782) due to low stress. Check mass sum after area changes to keep <30. Estimate stresses proportional to force / area.",
  
  "calculation": "New node_4: (2.55, 2.0). Member_2 length ~ sqrt((6-2.55)^2 + (0-2)^2) = sqrt(3.45^2 + 2^2) ~ 4.0. Area increased from 0.195 to 0.782 (area_id=2). Member_1 and member_4 area reduced from 1.759 to 0.782 (area_id=2). Member_3 and member_5 areas unchanged. Estimated mass: member_1 length ~ sqrt((2.55)^2 + (2)^2) ~ 3.25 * 0.782 = 2.54; member_2 length 4.0 * 0.782 = 3.13; member_3 length ~ sqrt((2-2.55)^2 + (0-2)^2) ~2.07 * 0.782=1.62; member_4 length sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-0)^2)=4*0.782=3.13; member_5 length 2*0.782=1.56; Total mass ~ 11.98, well below 30. Stress in member_2 reduced by ~factor of 4 (area increase), from 27.35 to ~6.8, improving max stress. Other members stress adjusted accordingly but expected lower max stress.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved up to 2.0 y. Increased member_2 area to 2 (0.782), reduced member_1 and member_4 area to 2 (0.782). Other areas unchanged. Mass < 30, max stress < 30. Structure closed with 5 members and 4 nodes. Supports and load nodes fixed. This step should improve max stress significantly. Continue next iterations for fine tuning.",
