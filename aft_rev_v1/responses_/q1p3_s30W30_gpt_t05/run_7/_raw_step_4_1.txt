Increasing area here or adjusting geometry to reduce force in member_2 is needed. Members 1 and 5 have larger areas but moderate stress. Node_4 is low at y=1.7, increasing y may reduce stress in member_2 by better force path. Member_4 area is large (3) but low stress (-2.7), area can be reduced to save mass. Member_1 area is 3 with low stress (4.8), can reduce area to save mass. Member_3 area 2 moderate stress (-9.5), member_5 area 3 moderate stress (-8.0).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on increasing node_4 y-coordinate to reduce tensile stress in member_2 and redistribute forces.
