Load and supports fixed. Node_4 moved progressively to optimize stress.",\n  "analysis": "The current truss with node_4 at (2.55, 2.22) and members with area ids mostly 2 and 3 yields max stress ~9.3 and total mass ~14.3. All stresses are well within limits. The structure is stable with pinned and roller supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. Load at node_3 fixed. No constraint violations.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further moving node_4 or changing member areas risks increasing stress or mass. Current member areas are moderate. Stress distribution is balanced between tension and compression. Minimal mass usage below limit suggests no need for larger areas.",\n  "reasoning": "Given constraints, moving node_4 further risks unstable or higher stress. Current stress distribution is low and mass is well below max. Member areas are chosen to balance stress and mass. No redundant members or nodes added, structure is closed. Optimization has converged.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas yield member masses summing to 14.2866. Max stress 9.32 is low safety factor 3.2 relative to limit 30. Node_4 position is optimal for load transfer and stress minimization.
