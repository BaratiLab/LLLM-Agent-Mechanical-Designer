Goal: reduce stress further by adjusting free node_4 position and member areas.",\n  "analysis": "Member_4 has highest tensile stress (18.88) with smallest area (0.195). Increasing its area can reduce stress. Member_1 has high compressive stress (-16.28). Node_4 moved from y=3.0 to 2.5 increased mass but reduced max stress from 29.05 to 18.88. Further optimization possible by repositioning node_4 to balance force paths and adjusting member areas.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increase area of member_4 from \'1\' (0.195) to \'2\' (0.782) or \'3\' (1.759) to reduce stress. Move node_4 slightly left and down to reduce member_4 stress and balance stresses in members 3 and 5.",\n  "reasoning": "Increasing member_4 area reduces its stress by increasing capacity. Moving node_4 closer to node_3 and slightly lower reduces lever arm, reducing stress in member_4 and member_3. Maintaining closed truss with 5 members is key. Avoid increasing mass over 30.

Member lengths: m4 (node_4-node_2) length ~ sqrt((6-2.7)^2 + (0-2)^2)=sqrt(3.3^2+2^2)=~3.87. Mass m4=3.87*1.759=6.8 (was 0.76). Increase in mass offset by reducing member_3 area from 4(3.128) to 2(0.782), mass m3 length ~ sqrt((2.7-0)^2+(2-0)^2)=~3.4, m3 mass=3.4*0.782=2.66 (was 12.2). Net mass change reduces total mass.
