Must connect all nodes in closed loop.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current nodes are colinear on x-axis: node_1(0,0), node_3(2,0), node_2(6,0). To form closed truss, add at least one node above or below x-axis to form triangle(s). Load at node_3 downward-left (-45°). Supports at ends. To reduce stress, triangular geometry is ideal. Add node_4 above node_3, say at (2.0, 3.0) to form stable triangle. Connect members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3. This forms closed polygon with 5 members. Choose member areas to keep stress ≤30, mass ≤30. Use basic truss statics and length calculations for mass and stress approximations.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "New node_4(2.0,3.0) added to form triangle with node_1 and node_2.

Check stress by simple load path assumption: load at node_3 is -10N at -45°, resolve into vertical and horizontal components ~ -7.07 N each. Assume members carry axial forces accordingly. Approximate stress = force/area. Adjust areas to keep stress ≤30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_4 at (2.0,3.0) creates stable triangular geometry reducing bending and stress. Members connecting node_4 distribute load efficiently. Areas selected to balance stress and mass: higher area for members carrying higher forces, lower for others. Use given discrete areas.

Stress = force/area ≤30 → area ≥ force/30. For 7.07N, area ≥0.236. Choose area=0.782 (id 2) for safety. For other members with less force, area=0.195 (id 1) or 1 (id 0).
