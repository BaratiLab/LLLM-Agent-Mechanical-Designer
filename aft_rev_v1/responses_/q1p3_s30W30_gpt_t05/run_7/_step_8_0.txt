  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress and maintain constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 15.73 well below limit 30. Mass 16.38 below 30. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_4 movable. Member areas mostly 2 and 3. Members under tension and compression distributed.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_5 (-15.73), tensile/compressive stress well within limits. Mass is moderate. Member_4 area is 3 (7.036 mass), possibly large for low stress (-2.01). Members 1,2,3 areas are 2 (0.782 area). Member 5 area 2. Member_4 area can be reduced to lower mass without increasing stress beyond limits. Node_4 vertical position at 2.3; previous steps show slight stress reduction by adjusting node_4 height around 2.2-2.4. Horizontal position fixed to 2.55 in last iterations. Member_4 connects node_3(2,0) to node_2(6,0), a long member with low stress, so area can be reduced. Member_5 (node_1 to node_3) has highest stress -15.73, area 2; increasing area here may reduce stress. Member_1,3,2 have moderate stress around 9 and 5.4. Node_4 vertical position can be slightly adjusted to balance forces better. Overall, optimize by slight node_4 vertical shift down to ~2.2-2.25, reduce member_4 area from 3 to 2, increase member_5 area from 2 to 3 to reduce max stress. This keeps mass within limit and reduces max stress.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member areas: {'0':1, '1':0.195, '2':0.782, '3':1.759, ...}. Current areas: member_4 area=3 (1.759), member_5 area=2 (0.782). Changing member_4 area to 2 reduces mass by ~3.128. Increasing member_5 area to 3 adds ~0.782 mass. Net mass reduction ~2.3, total mass ~14.1 < 30 limit. Max stress expected to reduce from 15.7 to ~12-13 by increasing area on highest stressed member. Node_4 vertical position adjustment to 2.2 expected to balance stresses better.",
  
  "reasoning": "Increasing cross-sectional area on highest stressed member reduces stress proportionally. Reducing area on low stress member reduces mass. Moving node_4 vertically affects member lengths and angles, redistributing internal forces. Keep load/support nodes fixed. Areas chosen from allowed discrete set. No duplicate nodes or members. Maintain closed truss topology. Mass and max stress constraints satisfied.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member_4 area from 3 to 2: mass reduction ~3.128. Member_5 area from 2 to 3: mass increase ~0.782. Net mass ~16.3772 - 3.128 + 0.782 = 14.03 approx. Max stress on member_5 expected to reduce from 15.73 to ~9.7 (approximate inverse proportionality). Node_4 y from 2.3 to 2.22 to improve force distribution. Node_4 x fixed at 2.55. Other nodes fixed.",
  
  "calculation": "Update node_4 position to (2.55, 2.22). Update member_4 area to '2'. Update member_5 area to '3'. Other members keep area as is. Recalculate expected mass: sum member lengths * area. Member lengths approx: member_4 length ~4 (between (2,0) and (6,0)), member_5 length ~2 (between (0,0) and (2,0)). New mass approx under 15. Max stress expected reduced below 15. Constraints met.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no nodes overlap, no duplicate members. Node_4 position changed only. Areas from allowed set. Mass < 30. Max stress < 30. Load/support nodes fixed. Closed truss maintained. Proceed with new design.",
