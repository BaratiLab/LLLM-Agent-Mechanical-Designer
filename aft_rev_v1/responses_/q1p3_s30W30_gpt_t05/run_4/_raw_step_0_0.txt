Load at node_3 (-10, -45°) implies force magnitude ~10 at 45° down-left. Supports fix reactions at node_1 and node_2. Aim to minimize stress by distributing load through triangular members.

Use smaller areas on longer members to keep mass low, larger areas on high-stress members.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangular geometry with node_4 elevated reduces bending moment and distributes load efficiently. Members near load node_3 carry higher stress, so assign moderate area. Base members can be smaller area. Calculate approximate member forces using static equilibrium (sum forces and moments zero). Use truss assumption: axial forces only. Approximate stress = force / area. Check max stress ≤ 30 and total mass ≤ 30. Adjust areas accordingly.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: truss members only axial forces, load applied only at node_3, supports ideal pinned and roller.
