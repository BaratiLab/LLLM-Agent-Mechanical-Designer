  "preamble": "Current design satisfies constraints with low max stress and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 10.55 < 30 allowed; total mass 22.71 < 30 allowed; load on node_3; supports fixed at node_1 and node_2; node_5 moved to (3.5, 2.5).",
  "analysis": "Stress is well below allowable limits; mass is significantly below max; members have appropriate areas; node_5 positioned to balance load and reduce stress; no member exceeds Â±30 stress limit.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further reducing stress would require increasing member areas or repositioning node_5; increasing areas would increase mass above current; repositioning node_5 closer to line between supports reduces load transfer efficiency.",
  "reasoning": "Current node placement and member sizing balance stress and mass effectively; member_5 with highest stress (-10.545) is within limits; all members within stress and mass constraints; load is well supported by pinned and roller supports.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member areas chosen from allowed set; members with higher stress have larger areas; no excessive stress concentration; geometry is stable and closed; no duplicate nodes or members.",
  "calculation": "No changes needed; node_5 at (3.5, 2.5) optimizes force distribution; member areas 2 and 3 chosen to balance mass and stress; total mass 22.71 < 30; max stress 10.55 < 30.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met; structure is closed; no further improvements without increasing mass or violating constraints; stop optimization.",
