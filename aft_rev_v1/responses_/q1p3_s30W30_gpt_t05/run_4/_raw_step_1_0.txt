Constraints: |stress| ≤ 30, mass ≤ 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current max stress 34.19 > 30 (member_3), total mass 20.15 < 30. Member_3 area too small for load. Member_5 large area but low stress. Structure has node_4 at (3,3) connecting to nodes 1,2,3. Load at node_3 creates high stress in member_3 (node_1 to node_4).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce member_3 stress, either reduce its load or add alternative load path. Adding a node above node_3 to distribute load better. Adjust member areas to balance stress and mass. Avoid increasing mass beyond 30.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 above node_3 at (2.0, 4.0). Connect node_5 to nodes 1, 2, and 3 to create a truss triangle above node_3. Remove member_3 (node_1-node_4). Adjust member areas to reduce stress in critical members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 creates a more direct load path from node_3 to supports via node_5, reducing stress on member_3. Removing node_4 and its members reduces mass and complexity. Using moderate areas to keep stresses under limits and mass under 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and assign areas from given discrete set. Estimate stresses with new geometry.
