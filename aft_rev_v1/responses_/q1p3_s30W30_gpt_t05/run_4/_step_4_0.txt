  "preamble": "Optimize truss to minimize stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max stress ±30, max mass 30. Current max stress 16.08 < 30, mass 25.57 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_5 moved from (2,2.5) to (3.5,3). Members use areas 2 and 3 mostly. Objective: reduce max stress further while keeping mass and constraints satisfied.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design satisfies constraints with max stress 16.08 and mass 25.57. Stress concentrated in member_1 (-16.08) and member_5 (-4.49). Members connecting node_5 to node_1, node_2, and node_3 have relatively large areas (3). Node_5 placement at (3.5,3) shifts load path. Member_2 stress is low (-2.51), member_4 very low (1.74).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing stress in member_1 and member_5 is key. Member_1 connects node_1(0,0) to node_3(2,0). Member_5 connects node_5(3.5,3) to node_3(2,0). Possibly moving node_5 slightly closer to node_3 horizontally to reduce tension/compression forces, or adjusting member areas. Member_1 area currently 2, member_5 area 3. Consider reducing member_5 area to 2 to reduce mass if stress allows. Possibly move node_5 down slightly to reduce member lengths and stresses.",
  
  "reasoning": "Minimizing stress involves balancing geometry and member sizing. Moving node_5 closer to the line between node_1 and node_2 may reduce bending effects and stress concentration. Reducing member areas where stress is low can reduce mass without increasing stress beyond limits. Member_1 stress is compressive and high, so increasing its area from 2 to 3 may reduce stress. Member_5 is less stressed, area 3 may be reduced to 2. Node_5 vertical position can be lowered slightly to reduce member lengths and thus mass and stress. Node_3 and supports fixed.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: member_1 length = 2.0 (node_1 to node_3), member_5 length ≈ sqrt((3.5-2)^2 + (3-0)^2) ≈ sqrt(2.25 + 9) = sqrt(11.25) ≈ 3.354. Moving node_5 down to ~2.5 reduces length to sqrt(2.25 + 6.25) = sqrt(8.5) ≈ 2.915. This reduces mass and stress. Member areas: increase member_1 area from 2 (0.782) to 3 (1.759) reduces stress by increasing capacity. Reduce member_5 area from 3 to 2 reduces mass, stress impact minimal due to low stress. Member_3 and member_4 areas can remain 3 for stability.",
  
  "calculation": "Adjust node_5 from (3.5,3.0) to (3.5,2.5). Change member_1 area from '2' to '3', member_5 area from '3' to '2'. New member lengths and masses recalculated: member_1 length 2.0 × 1.759 = 3.518, member_5 length ~2.915 × 0.782 = 2.279. Mass reduction in member_5 compensates area increase in member_1. Expected max stress decrease in member_1 due to larger area, slight stress increase possible in member_5 but still under limit. Total mass estimated ~25.57 - (5.8999 - 2.279) + (3.518 - 1.564) ≈ 25.57 - 3.62 + 1.954 = 23.9 approx, under max mass 30.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_5 lowered vertically to reduce member lengths and stresses. Member_1 area increased to reduce compressive stress. Member_5 area reduced to save mass. Other members unchanged. All constraints met. Further optimization possible but marginal improvements expected. Continue optimization next iteration.",
