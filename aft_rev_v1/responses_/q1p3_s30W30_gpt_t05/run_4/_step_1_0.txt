  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under given load/support with stress and mass limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 (-10N, -45°), supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Constraints: |stress| ≤ 30, mass ≤ 30.",
  
  "analysis": "Current max stress 34.19 > 30 (member_3), total mass 20.15 < 30. Member_3 area too small for load. Member_5 large area but low stress. Structure has node_4 at (3,3) connecting to nodes 1,2,3. Load at node_3 creates high stress in member_3 (node_1 to node_4).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce member_3 stress, either reduce its load or add alternative load path. Adding a node above node_3 to distribute load better. Adjust member areas to balance stress and mass. Avoid increasing mass beyond 30.",
  
  "proposal": "Add node_5 above node_3 at (2.0, 4.0). Connect node_5 to nodes 1, 2, and 3 to create a truss triangle above node_3. Remove member_3 (node_1-node_4). Adjust member areas to reduce stress in critical members.",
  
  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 creates a more direct load path from node_3 to supports via node_5, reducing stress on member_3. Removing node_4 and its members reduces mass and complexity. Using moderate areas to keep stresses under limits and mass under 30.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and assign areas from given discrete set. Estimate stresses with new geometry. Ensure no duplicate members/nodes. Keep support/load nodes fixed. Areas chosen to keep stress ≤30 and sum mass ≤30.",
  
  "calculation": "Nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_5(2,4). Members: m1(node_1-node_3), m2(node_3-node_2), m3(node_1-node_5), m4(node_5-node_2), m5(node_5-node_3). Lengths: m1=2m, m2=4m, m3=4.472m, m4=4.472m, m5=4m. Assign areas: m1=3(1.759), m2=3(1.759), m3=4(3.128), m4=4(3.128), m5=2(0.782). Total mass approx: 2*1.759 + 4*1.759 + 4.472*3.128*2 + 4*0.782 = approx 24 < 30. Stress expected reduced due to load redistribution.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no member stress >30 or < -30, total mass <30, no duplicate nodes/members, supports/loads unchanged. Node_5 added to improve load path and reduce peak stress.",
