  "preamble": "Optimize truss to meet stress ±30 and mass ≤30 constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 (-10, -45°), supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current max stress 58 exceeds ±30 limit. Mass 7.7 under max 30, so mass is acceptable. Need to reduce stress by redesign or member sizing.",
  
  "analysis": "Current structure has 7 members with small cross-sections (area_id=1 mostly) but high stresses up to 58. Members near load and top nodes are overstressed. The low mass suggests we can increase member areas selectively. Geometry with nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), (2,2.5), (3,2.5) creates a trapezoidal shape. The load is on node_3 at (2,0). The top nodes (node_4 and node_5) are close, causing short members with high stress. The bottom chord is split by node_3. Member_5, member_6, member_7 have very high stress, indicating top chord and diagonals are overstressed.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, increase areas on top chord and diagonals. Possibly rearrange top nodes for better load path. Consider removing node_4 and use one top node at mid-span for simplicity. Use larger areas on main load path members. Avoid redundant members causing stress concentration.",
  
  "proposal": "Remove node_4. Keep nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_5(3.5,3.0) - move node_5 slightly higher and right for better triangulation. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_5-node_3. Assign areas: bottom chord (node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2) area_id=3 (1.759), top chord (node_1-node_5 and node_5-node_2) area_id=4 (3.128), diagonals (node_5-node_3) area_id=4 (3.128). This reduces complexity, increases member areas on critical paths, and should reduce max stress below 30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Removing node_4 simplifies the structure, reducing stress concentration. Increasing areas on top chord and diagonals strengthens load paths from load at node_3 to supports. Moving node_5 higher and right improves geometry for load transfer and reduces bending. Using moderate area sizes balances mass and strength. Estimated mass remains below 30. This design follows standard triangular truss principles for efficient load transfer.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_2 = 4.0, node_1-node_5 ≈ sqrt(3.5² + 3.0²)=4.609, node_5-node_2 ≈ sqrt(2.5² + 3.0²)=3.905, node_5-node_3 ≈ sqrt(1.5² + 3.0²)=3.354. Mass = sum(length × area). Using areas 1.759, 3.128, total mass = 2*1.759 + 4*3.128 ≈ 3.518 + 12.512 = 16.03 < 30. Stress expected to be reduced by increased areas and better geometry.",
  
  "calculation": "Mass approx: member_1 (2.0*1.759=3.518), member_2 (4.0*1.759=7.036), member_3 (4.609*3.128=14.41), member_4 (3.905*3.128=12.22), member_5 (3.354*3.128=10.49). Total mass = 3.518+7.036+14.41+12.22+10.49=47.67 too high. Reduce bottom chord area to 0.782 (area_id=2): member_1=2*0.782=1.564, member_2=4*0.782=3.128. Top chord and diagonal keep 3.128. New mass=1.564+3.128+14.41+12.22+10.49=41.8 still high. Reduce diagonal to 1.759 (area_id=3): member_5=3.354*1.759=5.9. New mass=1.564+3.128+14.41+12.22+5.9=37.22 still high. Reduce top chord to 1.759: member_3=4.609*1.759=8.1, member_4=3.905*1.759=6.87. Total mass=1.564+3.128+8.1+6.87+5.9=25.56 <30 acceptable. Stress should remain below 30 with these areas.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Final design uses 5 members, 4 nodes (excluding node_4). Areas: bottom chord area_id=2 (0.782), top chord and diagonal area_id=3 (1.759). Mass ~25.56 < 30. Geometry improved for load path. Stress expected below ±30 due to better load distribution and increased areas on critical members.",
