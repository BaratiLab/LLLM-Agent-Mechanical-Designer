Max stress ±30, max mass 30. Current mass 45.37 exceeds limit. Existing nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_5(2,4). Members connect base and top nodes with large areas causing high mass.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design meets stress constraints but mass is 45.37 > 30. Large cross sections on vertical members cause high mass. Node_5 at (2,4) creates long members with large area. Need to reduce mass by optimizing geometry and areas. Load at node_3 at 2,0 causes tension/compression in members around node_3. Current topology is a simple trapezoidal truss with one top node. Adding an intermediate node can reduce member length or redistribute forces. Areas can be reduced on low-stress members. Avoid changing load/support node positions. Aim to reduce vertical height to shorten members and reduce mass. Possibly add a node closer to node_3 horizontally and lower vertically to reduce member lengths.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_5 down from 4.0 to ~2.5 to shorten members. Add node_4 between node_3 and node_5 to create a triangular bracing. Use smaller area IDs on members with low stress. Possibly reduce area on members_3 and _4 from 4 to 2 or 1. Keep members_1 and _2 moderate area. Add diagonal members to improve force distribution and reduce member areas and mass.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_4 at (3.0, 2.5). Nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(3,2.5), node_5(2,2.5). Members: member_1: node_1-node_3 area 2, member_2: node_3-node_2 area 2, member_3: node_1-node_5 area 1, member_4: node_5-node_2 area 1, member_5: node_5-node_4 area 1, member_6: node_4-node_3 area 1, member_7: node_4-node_2 area 1. This creates a more triangulated structure, shorter members, and allows smaller areas while maintaining stiffness and strength. This should reduce mass below 30 and keep max stress within ±30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_4 and lowering node_5 reduces member length and allows smaller cross sections. Using area 1 (0.195) for many members reduces mass significantly. Triangulation improves load path and stiffness, reducing peak stresses. Members between new nodes carry redistributed forces, allowing smaller areas. Member lengths are shorter, reducing mass. Load at node_3 is better supported by multiple paths. Supports unchanged. This design balances mass and stress constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_2=4.0, node_1-node_5= sqrt(2^2 + 2.5^2) ~3.2, node_5-node_2= sqrt(4^2 + 2.5^2) ~4.72, node_5-node_4=1.0, node_4-node_3= sqrt(1^2 + 2.5^2) ~2.69, node_4-node_2= sqrt(3^2 + 2.5^2) ~3.9.
