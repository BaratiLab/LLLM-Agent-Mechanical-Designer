Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_4 moved in previous iterations to reduce stress. Member_4 has highest stress ~19.82, area=1. Consider increasing area or adjusting node_4 to reduce stress in member_4.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_4 (node_2-node_4) has max tensile stress near limit. Area is currently 1 (0.195 area factor). Increasing area here may reduce stress. Node_4 position affects member lengths and angles, influencing stress distribution. Moving node_4 closer to node_2 horizontally or lowering vertically might reduce stress in member_4 but may increase stress elsewhere. Node_3 and supports fixed, so only node_4 can be moved. Current areas for members: member_1(3), member_2(2), member_3(2), member_4(1), member_5(2).",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing area of member_4 from 1 (0.195) to 2 (0.782) or 3 (1.759) could reduce stress. But mass will increase. Node_4 is at (2.1, 3.0). Moving node_4 slightly right and down to reduce member_4 stress. Also consider increasing area of member_4 to 2 to reduce stress. Check if mass remains < 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_4 stress is tensile and highest. Increasing its cross-sectional area reduces stress proportionally. Node_4 position affects member_4 length and angle; moving node_4 closer horizontally to node_2 (6,0) reduces member length and stress. But too close may increase stress in member_3 or member_5. The balance is to slightly move node_4 towards node_2 and lower it to reduce member_4 stress. Increase area of member_4 to 2 (0.782) to reduce stress further. Other members areas remain same to control mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approx: member_4 length = sqrt((6-2.1)^2 + (0-3)^2) = sqrt(3.9^2+3^2)=sqrt(15.21+9)=sqrt(24.21)=4.92. If node_4 moved to (2.4,2.7), length = sqrt((6-2.4)^2+(0-2.7)^2)= sqrt(3.6^2+2.7^2)= sqrt(12.96+7.29)= sqrt(20.25)=4.5. Reduction in length reduces force demand. Area increase from 1 to 2 multiplies area by 4x (0.195 to 0.782). Stress = Force / Area, so stress reduces approx by factor 4. Mass increase: member_4 length * area factor. Current mass member_4=0.9595. New mass=4.5*0.782=3.519, increase about 2.56. Total mass new ~ 12.82 - 0.96 + 3.52 = 15.38 < 30 allowed.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Move node_4 to (2.4, 2.7). Increase member_4 area to \'2\' (0.782). Keep other members same areas. This reduces member_4 stress approx by factor 4 and slightly reduces length. Expected max stress < 10.
