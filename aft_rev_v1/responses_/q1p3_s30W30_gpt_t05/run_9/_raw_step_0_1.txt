Load -10 at node_3 at -45°, i.e. Fx = -10*cos45° ≈ -7.07, Fy = -10*sin45° ≈ -7.07 downward-left. Supports prevent horizontal (pinned) and vertical (roller) displacements at ends. Closed truss with 3 nodes forms a triangle. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_2. Calculate member lengths, estimate forces by static equilibrium, determine areas to keep stress ≤30 and sum of length×area ≤30.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Triangle is simplest closed truss. Load at node_3 creates tension/compression in members. Use areas to reduce stress and mass. Member lengths: n1-n2=6, n1-n3=2, n3-n2=4.47. Mass = sum(length×area). Try smallest areas first, increase if stress >30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Assume axial forces only. Use static equilibrium at node_3: sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0. Calculate member forces from load components. Stress = Force / Area. Select area from given discrete set to keep |stress| ≤30. Mass = sum(length×area). Minimize mass while meeting stress constraint. Choose areas starting low and increase as needed. Use cos/sin of angles for force components.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: L_1-2=6.0, L_1-3=2.0, L_3-2=√((6-2)^2+(0-0)^2)=4.0 (correction: node_3 and node_2 both on x-axis, so 4.0). Load components at node_3: Fx=-7.07, Fy=-7.07. Members n1-n3 horizontal (2 units), n3-n2 horizontal (4 units), n1-n2 horizontal (6 units). Since all nodes on x-axis, vertical load at node_3 will induce bending if only horizontal members. Need to add a vertical node or diagonal member for vertical load path. To keep nodes fixed, add a new node_4 above node_3 to form a triangle for vertical load transfer.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) to form triangle with node_1 and node_2.

Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Use equilibrium at node_3 and node_4 to solve forces. Approximate axial forces, then calculate stress = force/area.
