  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position and member areas to reduce max stress while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 18.57 < 30, total mass 13.298 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved recently to (2.15,3.3). Member_4 stress high at 18.57 with area 1, others lower stress.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_4 shows highest stress (18.57) with smallest area (1). Increasing its area can reduce stress. Node_4 vertical position affects member lengths and stress distribution. Current node_4 at (2.15,3.3) is a compromise from previous iterations. Member_3 and member_5 have moderate stress with area 2 or 3. Member_1 area 3 is large, but stress low (-5.77). Member_2 area 2 is low stress. Constraints allow area up to 10 and max stress ±30. Mass well below max 30. Strategy: Increase member_4 area to reduce stress, slightly adjust node_4 horizontally to balance forces and minimize stress further.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Increase member_4 area from 1 to 2 or 3 to reduce stress. Node_4 x from 2.15 to ~2.25 may reduce stress on member_4 by adjusting geometry. Keep y around 3.3 to maintain vertical support. Check mass impact after area increase.",

  "reasoning": "Member stress inversely proportional to area for given force. Increasing area reduces stress. Node_4 position affects member lengths and force angles, influencing stress distribution. Moving node_4 slightly right can reduce tension in member_4 by balancing geometry. Avoid large moves to keep structure stable and within constraints. Member_4 area increase from 1 to 3 increases mass by ~2× length×(area difference). Current member_4 length ~ sqrt((6-2.15)^2 + (0-3.3)^2) ≈ 4.7. Area increase from 1 to 3 adds ~4.7×(3.128-0.195) ≈ 13.7 mass increase, which is large. Instead, increase area to 2 (0.782) for moderate mass increase (~4.7×(0.782-0.195)=~2.7). Total mass will rise from 13.298 to ~16.0, still under 30.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member_4 length = sqrt((6-2.15)^2 + (0-3.3)^2) = sqrt(3.85^2 + 3.3^2) = sqrt(14.82 + 10.89) = sqrt(25.71) = 5.07 (recalculated). Area increase from 1 (0.195) to 2 (0.782) adds (0.782-0.195)*5.07 = 2.98 mass. New total mass ~ 13.298 + 2.98 = 16.28 < 30. Member_4 stress expected to reduce by ~0.195/0.782 = 1/4, from 18.57 to ~7.5. This is good. Slight node_4 x increase to 2.25 reduces member_4 length slightly, lowering stress further. Node_4 y maintained at 3.3.",
  
  "calculation": "Update member_4 area to '2'. Move node_4 from (2.15, 3.3) to (2.25, 3.3). Keep other nodes fixed. Member connections unchanged. Expect max stress to reduce below current 18.57, mass ~16.3. Stress distribution more balanced. Member_1,3,5 areas unchanged to keep mass low and stress moderate.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Check no duplicate nodes or members. Load and supports nodes unchanged. Node_4 moved only horizontally. Areas valid from given set. Constraints met: stress < 30, mass < 30. Optimization can continue next iteration if needed.",
