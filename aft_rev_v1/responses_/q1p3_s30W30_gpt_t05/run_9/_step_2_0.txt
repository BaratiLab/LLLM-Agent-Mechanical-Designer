  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position and area distribution to reduce max stress further.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 13.35 well below Â±30 limit; total mass 14.691 < 30 limit. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved up and right from previous iteration, stress reduced significantly. All members currently area '2' (0.782).",
  "analysis": "Stress concentrated mostly in member_1 (-13.35) and member_5 (-9.13). Members 3 and 4 have low tensile stresses. Mass is moderate, room to increase area if needed. Node_4 position affects load path and stress distribution. Load and support nodes fixed; only node_4 can be adjusted.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider shifting node_4 slightly left and/or down to balance forces better and reduce compressive stress in member_1 and member_5. Possibly increase area on members with high stress and reduce on low-stress members to optimize mass-stress tradeoff.",
  "reasoning": "Member_1 and member_5 are highly stressed in compression; reducing their length or changing angle may reduce stress. Member_3 and 4 have low stress, area can be reduced there to save mass. Node_4 currently at (2.5, 3.5) is high; lowering it slightly may reduce bending moment on members connected to node_1 and node_3. Area adjustments can fine-tune stress distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: m1 ~ distance(node_1, node_3)=2.0, m5 ~ distance(node_3, node_4)=sqrt((2.5-2)^2+(3.5-0)^2)=~3.54. Reducing node_4 y from 3.5 to ~3.0 reduces m5 length and stress. Area choices: keep '2' (0.782) for high stress members; reduce to '1' (0.195) for low stress members to save mass.",
  "calculation": "New node_4: (2.3, 3.0). Member areas: m1=3 (1.759), m5=3 (1.759), m3=1 (0.195), m4=1 (0.195), m2=2 (0.782). Mass estimate: sum(length*area) ~ (2*1.759)+(3.54*1.759)+(3.605*0.195)+(3.7*0.195)+(4*0.782)=3.518+6.22+0.703+0.722+3.128=14.29 <14.69 previous, slight mass reduction. Expected stress reduction in m1 and m5 due to shorter length and increased area; lower stress in m3 and m4 due to smaller area.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved left and down to reduce compressive stress in critical members. Area adjusted to increase capacity in high stress members and reduce mass in low stress members. Mass and max stress within constraints. Load and supports unchanged. No duplicate nodes or members. Precision maintained.",
