Load at node_3, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Node_4 movable; others fixed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design at iteration 7 has max stress 9.12 and total mass 14.94, both well within constraints. Stress distribution is balanced with no member exceeding ±10. Node_4 positioned at (2.35, 2.6) gives low stress and reasonable mass. Member areas are moderate, avoiding over-sizing.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further small node_4 adjustments unlikely to significantly reduce max stress below current 9.12 without increasing mass or violating constraints. Member areas are already balanced for load path.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Stress is minimized by keeping node_4 near vertical above node_3 to reduce bending moments and distribute forces evenly. Member area assignments reflect force demands, with larger areas on high-stress members (member_1 area 3, member_3,4,5 area 2). Total mass is half the max allowed, providing margin.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Tried moving node_4 slightly higher or lower previously increased max stress or mass. Reducing member areas risks exceeding stress limits. Current design is a good compromise between mass and stress.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths and areas produce total mass 14.9426 < 30.
