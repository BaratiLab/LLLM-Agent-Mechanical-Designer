  "preamble": "Optimize truss by adjusting free node to reduce max stress under constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max stress Â±30, max mass 30. Current max stress 9.07 < 30, mass 16.26 < 30, so feasible. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 movable. Members mostly area 2 or 3.",
  
  "analysis": "Current max stress is low (9.07) with moderate mass (16.26). Stress distribution is fairly balanced, member_5 in compression is highest stress (-9.07). Node_4 moved from 2.15 to 2.25 x and fixed y=3.3. Member areas mostly 2, except member_1 area 3. Member_4 increased area from 1 to 2 in last step, increasing mass. Could reduce member_4 area back to 1 to reduce mass and possibly optimize stress. Also, slight repositioning of node_4 to reduce stress in member_5 and member_3 could help. Member_1 area 3 seems fine for tension. Plan: slightly adjust node_4 coordinates to reduce stress on member_5 and member_3, revert member_4 area to 1 to reduce mass and check stress impact.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_5 highest compressive stress -9.0682, member_3 tension 7.296. Member_4 stress low 4.5625 but area 2 (3.9 mass). Reducing area to 1 will reduce mass ~2.0. Node_4 coordinates affect member_3,4,5 stresses. Move node_4 slightly left and/or down to reduce tension in member_3 and compression in member_5.",
  
  "reasoning": "Reducing member_4 area from 2 to 1 reduces mass by ~1.9 units. Slightly moving node_4 left (x from 2.25 to ~2.1) and down (y from 3.3 to ~3.0) can balance forces better, reducing max stress. Member_1 and 2 remain same. Area selection from given set, keep member_1 area 3 for tension capacity. Member_3 and 5 area 2 sufficient given stresses. This small move should maintain closed truss and constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4 new position ~ (2.1, 3.0). Member_4 area from '2' to '1'. Check mass: member_4 length ~ sqrt((6-2.1)^2 + (0-3)^2) ~ sqrt(15.21 + 9) = sqrt(24.21) ~4.92. Mass member_4 = length * area factor: 4.92 * 0.782 = 3.85 (previous 3.9 close). Total mass reduces by ~0.06 but area reduction helps overall. Stress expected to reduce max stress from 9.07 towards ~7-8 range.",
  
  "calculation": "Update node_4 to (2.1, 3.0). Member_4 area '1'. Keep others same. Total mass estimated ~16.2 - 0.06 = 16.14. Max stress expected < 9.07. Constraints hold.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes or members. Node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_3 fixed. Node_4 moved within allowed range. Member areas valid from set. Structure closed. Stress and mass constraints satisfied.",
