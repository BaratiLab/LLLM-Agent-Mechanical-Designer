  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 19.82 < 30, total mass 12.82 < 30. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_4 moved in previous iterations to reduce stress. Member_4 has highest stress ~19.82, area=1. Consider increasing area or adjusting node_4 to reduce stress in member_4.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_4 (node_2-node_4) has max tensile stress near limit. Area is currently 1 (0.195 area factor). Increasing area here may reduce stress. Node_4 position affects member lengths and angles, influencing stress distribution. Moving node_4 closer to node_2 horizontally or lowering vertically might reduce stress in member_4 but may increase stress elsewhere. Node_3 and supports fixed, so only node_4 can be moved. Current areas for members: member_1(3), member_2(2), member_3(2), member_4(1), member_5(2).",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing area of member_4 from 1 (0.195) to 2 (0.782) or 3 (1.759) could reduce stress. But mass will increase. Node_4 is at (2.1, 3.0). Moving node_4 slightly right and down to reduce member_4 stress. Also consider increasing area of member_4 to 2 to reduce stress. Check if mass remains < 30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_4 stress is tensile and highest. Increasing its cross-sectional area reduces stress proportionally. Node_4 position affects member_4 length and angle; moving node_4 closer horizontally to node_2 (6,0) reduces member length and stress. But too close may increase stress in member_3 or member_5. The balance is to slightly move node_4 towards node_2 and lower it to reduce member_4 stress. Increase area of member_4 to 2 (0.782) to reduce stress further. Other members areas remain same to control mass.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approx: member_4 length = sqrt((6-2.1)^2 + (0-3)^2) = sqrt(3.9^2+3^2)=sqrt(15.21+9)=sqrt(24.21)=4.92. If node_4 moved to (2.4,2.7), length = sqrt((6-2.4)^2+(0-2.7)^2)= sqrt(3.6^2+2.7^2)= sqrt(12.96+7.29)= sqrt(20.25)=4.5. Reduction in length reduces force demand. Area increase from 1 to 2 multiplies area by 4x (0.195 to 0.782). Stress = Force / Area, so stress reduces approx by factor 4. Mass increase: member_4 length * area factor. Current mass member_4=0.9595. New mass=4.5*0.782=3.519, increase about 2.56. Total mass new ~ 12.82 - 0.96 + 3.52 = 15.38 < 30 allowed.",
  
  "calculation": "Move node_4 to (2.4, 2.7). Increase member_4 area to '2' (0.782). Keep other members same areas. This reduces member_4 stress approx by factor 4 and slightly reduces length. Expected max stress < 10. Mass increases but still well below 30. Stress in other members expected to remain similar or slightly reduced due to geometry change. This should improve max stress significantly and maintain mass constraints.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes or members. Node_4 moved, load/support nodes fixed. Areas selected from given set. Mass and stress constraints satisfied. Design remains a closed 2D truss. Optimization can continue if stress still > target, else can stop in next iteration.",
