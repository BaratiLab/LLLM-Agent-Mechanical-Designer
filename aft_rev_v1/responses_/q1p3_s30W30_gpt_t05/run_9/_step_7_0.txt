  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress further within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 9.14 < 30, mass 15.12 < 30, nodes fixed for load/support. Node_4 moved from prior higher positions down to 2.4,2.7. Members use mostly area_id 2 and 3.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is well below limit, mass is acceptable. Stress distribution shows member_5 highest compression (-9.14), member_3 highest tension (8.07). Member_1 tension ~ -6.4, member_2 ~ -4.0, member_4 ~ 5.0. Areas are moderate (2 or 3). Node_4 moved down from 3.0+ to 2.7 reduces stress from prior iterations. Further fine tuning node_4 can reduce stress on member_5 and member_3 by balancing geometry.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_5 compression high, reducing length or changing angle of node_4 could reduce stress. Node_4 can be moved slightly left or down to rebalance forces. Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed per instructions.",
  
  "reasoning": "Stress in truss members depends on geometry and loading. Moving node_4 affects member lengths and angles, redistributing forces. Current node_4 at (2.4, 2.7) is a good compromise but small shifts can lower max stress. Areas are adequate; changing area_id may increase mass unnecessarily. Focus on geometry optimization by adjusting node_4 within a small range to minimize max stress.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Try node_4 at (2.3, 2.6) or (2.5, 2.5) to test stress reduction. Member_5 length changes affect compression. Member_3 tension depends on vertical height of node_4. Balance between height and horizontal position critical to reduce max stress.",
  
  "calculation": "Set node_4 to (2.35, 2.6) to slightly reduce height and shift left, expected to reduce member_5 compression and member_3 tension. Keep member areas same: member_1 area_id=3, member_2 area_id=2, member_3 area_id=2, member_4 area_id=2, member_5 area_id=2. Mass remains under 30, stress expected <9.1.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved slightly left and down to (2.35, 2.6). Member areas unchanged. Expect marginal stress improvement while staying within constraints. Continue optimization if stress reduction observed.",
