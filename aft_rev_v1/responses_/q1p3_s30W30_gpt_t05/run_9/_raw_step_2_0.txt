Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved up and right from previous iteration, stress reduced significantly. All members currently area \'2\' (0.782).",\n  "analysis": "Stress concentrated mostly in member_1 (-13.35) and member_5 (-9.13). Members 3 and 4 have low tensile stresses. Mass is moderate, room to increase area if needed. Node_4 position affects load path and stress distribution. Load and support nodes fixed; only node_4 can be adjusted.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider shifting node_4 slightly left and/or down to balance forces better and reduce compressive stress in member_1 and member_5. Possibly increase area on members with high stress and reduce on low-stress members to optimize mass-stress tradeoff.",\n  "reasoning": "Member_1 and member_5 are highly stressed in compression; reducing their length or changing angle may reduce stress. Member_3 and 4 have low stress, area can be reduced there to save mass. Node_4 currently at (2.5, 3.5) is high; lowering it slightly may reduce bending moment on members connected to node_1 and node_3. Area adjustments can fine-tune stress distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: m1 ~ distance(node_1, node_3)=2.0, m5 ~ distance(node_3, node_4)=sqrt((2.5-2)^2+(3.5-0)^2)=~3.54. Reducing node_4 y from 3.5 to ~3.0 reduces m5 length and stress. Area choices: keep \'2\' (0.782) for high stress members; reduce to \'1\' (0.195) for low stress members to save mass.",\n  "calculation": "New node_4: (2.3, 3.0). Member areas: m1=3 (1.759), m5=3 (1.759), m3=1 (0.195), m4=1 (0.195), m2=2 (0.782). Mass estimate: sum(length*area) ~ (2*1.759)+(3.54*1.759)+(3.605*0.195)+(3.7*0.195)+(4*0.782)=3.518+6.22+0.703+0.722+3.128=14.29 <14.69 previous, slight mass reduction.
