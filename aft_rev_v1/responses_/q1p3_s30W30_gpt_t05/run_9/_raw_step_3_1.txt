Max stress ±30, max mass 30. Current max stress 30.46 slightly exceeded at member_3, mass 13.6 well below limit. Need to reduce stress in member_3 and keep mass low.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_3 (node_1-node_4) has max tensile stress slightly over limit (30.46 > 30). Member areas 1 and 3 used, mass distribution uneven. Member_5 (node_3-node_4) is heavy with area 3 and mass 5.3, possibly oversized. Node_4 position at (2.3,3.0) may cause stress concentration. Current design has 5 members with some redundancy. Slight adjustment of node_4 position and member areas can reduce stress without adding mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_4 slightly higher or more to left to reduce tension in member_3. Possibly reduce area in member_5 from 3 to 2 or 1. Increase area in member_3 slightly to reduce stress. Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Possibly remove member_4 if not critical or reduce its area to save mass.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep 4 nodes same except move node_4 to (2.15, 3.3) to reduce tension in member_3. Member areas: member_1: 3, member_2: 2, member_3: 2, member_4: 1, member_5: 2. This reduces stress in member_3 and member_5 while controlling mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing area in member_3 reduces its stress by increasing capacity. Moving node_4 slightly upward and left reduces axial force in member_3 by changing geometry and load path. Reducing member_5 area reduces mass and stress. Member_4 area kept minimal to maintain support stability. Member_1 and member_2 areas unchanged for support load transfer. This balances stress and mass within constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Length calculations: member_3 length ~ sqrt((2.15-0)^2 + (3.3-0)^2) ≈ 3.91; member_5 length ~ sqrt((2.0-2.15)^2 + (0.0-3.3)^2) ≈ 3.3; member_4 length ~ sqrt((6-2.15)^2 + (0-3.3)^2) ≈ 4.55.
