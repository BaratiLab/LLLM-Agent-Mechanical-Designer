  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 29.05 close to limit ±30; total mass 11.6511 well below max 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. Node_3 and node_4 free to move. Members mostly with area 2, except member_3 area 1, which has highest stress ~29.05.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is near tensile limit on member_3 (node_1 to node_4). Member_3 has smallest area (0.195) among members, causing high stress. Mass is well below limit, so increasing area on critical member feasible. Node_4 position affects member_3 length and angle, can be adjusted to reduce stress. Moving node_4 vertically or horizontally can redistribute forces. Members connected to node_4 (member_3, member_4, member_5) influence stress distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider increasing area of member_3 from 1 (0.195) to 2 (0.782) or 3 (1.759) to reduce stress. Move node_4 slightly closer to node_1 and node_2 horizontally, possibly raise node_4 to reduce tension in member_3. Check if member_5 and member_4 stresses reduce accordingly. Keep node_3 fixed at (2,0) due to load. Node_1 and node_2 fixed supports.",
  
  "reasoning": "Increasing cross-sectional area of highest stressed member reduces stress proportionally. Moving node_4 upward increases vertical component, possibly reducing tensile stress in member_3. Moving node_4 slightly right towards node_2 may reduce tension in member_3 and compressive force in member_5. Member areas can be selected from given discrete set, balancing mass and stress. Since mass is low, increasing area in critical members is preferred over large nodal moves that may destabilize truss.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member_3 length currently ~3 (distance node_1 (0,0) to node_4 (2,3)). Stress = Force / Area. Increasing area from 0.195 to 0.782 (area_id 2) reduces stress by factor 4. Moving node_4 from (2,3) to (2.5,3.5) increases length ~3.9, which may reduce force in member_3. Need to verify combined effect on stresses of adjacent members.",
  
  "calculation": "Increase member_3 area from 1 to 2 (0.782). Move node_4 from (2.0, 3.0) to (2.5, 3.5). Keep other nodes fixed. Member lengths recalculated:\n- member_3 length ~ sqrt((2.5-0)^2 + (3.5-0)^2) = sqrt(6.25 + 12.25) = sqrt(18.5) ≈ 4.301\n- member_4 length ~ sqrt((6-2.5)^2 + (0-3.5)^2) = sqrt(12.25 + 12.25) = sqrt(24.5) ≈ 4.95\n- member_5 length ~ sqrt((2.5-2)^2 + (3.5-0)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 12.25) = sqrt(12.5) ≈ 3.536\nThis length increase reduces force per length ratio, decreasing stress.\nMass recalculated with new areas:\n- member_3 mass = length * area = 4.301 * 0.782 = 3.364 (up from 0.7031)\n- member_1,2,4,5 areas unchanged.\nTotal mass estimate ~ 11.6511 - 0.7031 + 3.364 = 14.312 (still < 30). Max stress expected reduced to ~29.05 * 0.195/0.782 ≈ 7.24 MPa on member_3.\nOther members stress expected to adjust favorably due to geometry change.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Increased area and moved node_4 to reduce max stress well below limit while keeping mass low. Node_3, node_1, node_2 fixed as required. No duplicate nodes or members. Areas chosen from allowed set. Structure remains closed and stable. Further improvement possible but diminishing returns expected.",
