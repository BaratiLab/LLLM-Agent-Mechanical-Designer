Constraints: stress ±30, mass ≤30. Current mass 30.65 exceeds limit slightly. Max stress 10.62 within limit.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design nearly meets stress constraints but exceeds mass. Member_3 is very heavy (area_id 4). Members have mostly area_id 2 or 4. Node_5 added to reduce stress but adds mass. Some members can be reduced in area or replaced by more efficient triangulation. Current node_4 at (3,4) and node_5 at (4.5,2) create longer members adding mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce member_3 area from 4 (3.128) to 2 (0.782) or 1 (0.195). Add a new node between node_3 and node_2 to create better load path. Remove node_5 to reduce complexity and mass. Keep node_4 but move slightly to optimize force path. Use smaller areas where possible without exceeding stress. Add diagonal members to reduce bending and distribute forces.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_5. Shift node_4 slightly to (3.0, 3.5) for better triangulation. Add new node_6 at (4.0, 1.5) to create shorter members. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_6, node_6-node_2. Assign areas to minimize mass: mostly area_id 2 or less, with critical members area_id 3 or 4 if needed.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing node_5 reduces mass and complexity. Adding node_6 allows shorter members and better force distribution. Moving node_4 down reduces member length and mass. Using smaller cross sections in low force members reduces mass. Triangulation ensures stability and reduces bending stresses. This layout balances mass and stress constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and assign areas: node_1-node_3 length=2.0, node_3-node_2 length=4.0, node_1-node_4 length≈4.031, node_4-node_2 length≈3.201, node_3-node_4 length≈3.201, node_4-node_6 length≈2.121, node_6-node_2 length≈0.707. Assign area_id 2 (0.782) to shorter members, area_id 3 (1.759) to longer critical members. Total mass estimated below 30. Stress expected to be within limits due to improved triangulation.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Mass approx = sum(length × area). For example, node_1-node_3: 2.0×0.782=1.564, node_3-node_2:4.0×1.759=7.036, node_1-node_4:4.031×1.759=7.092, node_4-node_2:3.201×0.782=2.503, node_3-node_4:3.201×0.782=2.503, node_4-node_6:2.121×0.195=0.414, node_6-node_2:0.707×0.195=0.138.
