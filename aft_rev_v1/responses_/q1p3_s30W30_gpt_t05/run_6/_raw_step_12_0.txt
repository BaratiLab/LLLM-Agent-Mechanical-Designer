Current max stress ~14.12 and mass ~25.09 meet constraints.",\n  "analysis": "The current design has well-distributed stresses with no member exceeding half the allowable stress limit. Mass is well below the maximum allowed. Load and support nodes remain fixed. Minor nodal adjustments in past iterations yielded marginal improvements only.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress in highly loaded member_1 remains the highest compression (~-14.12). Members with zero stress (6,7) indicate efficient load paths. Areas are chosen from allowed set. No violations in constraints.",\n  "reasoning": "Further stress reduction below current max stress (~14.12) would require significant redesign or increased member areas, risking mass increase or constraint violation. Current nodal positions for load/support fixed; only node_4 and node_6 adjusted previously with limited benefit. Current design balances stress and mass optimally.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member areas: member_1 area_id=2 (0.782), member_2=3 (1.759), member_3=3 (1.759), member_4=2 (0.782), member_5=2 (0.782), member_6=1 (0.195), member_7=1 (0.195).
