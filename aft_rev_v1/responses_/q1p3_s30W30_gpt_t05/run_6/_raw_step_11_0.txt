Goal: reduce max stress further while maintaining constraints.",\n\n  "analysis": "Max compressive stress at member_1 (-14.55) and tensile at member_3 (3.63). Member_1 is critical. Node_4 and node_6 positions influence stress distribution. Current node_4 at (3.2,3.5), node_6 at (4.0,1.7). Mass is moderate, so reducing stress by slightly adjusting node_4 upward and node_6 closer to node_4 may improve load path and reduce stress concentration on member_1.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try increasing node_4 y-coordinate to raise the truss arch, improving force distribution. Move node_6 slightly right and down to better support node_2. Check if these changes reduce member_1 stress and keep mass under 30.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Raising node_4 increases triangle height, reducing axial force on member_1. Adjusting node_6 closer to node_4 and node_2 improves load transfer. Keep node_3 and supports fixed. Maintain connectivity and no duplicate members. Areas remain same.
