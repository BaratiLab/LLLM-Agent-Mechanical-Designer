Load at node_3 fixed, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Areas mostly set; consider minor geometry changes to reduce stress.",\n  "analysis": "Member_1 (node_1-node_3) has highest compressive stress; member_5 (node_3-node_4) also high compressive. Node_4 elevation increase previously reduced stress but increased mass. Node_6 position affects load path between node_4 and node_2. Current geometry yields balanced stress but room to reduce stress in member_1 by slightly raising node_4 and adjusting node_6 closer to node_4 to improve force distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try increasing node_4 y from 4.0 to ~4.2 to reduce compression in member_1 by increasing triangulation height. Move node_6 slightly left and up to (4.0, 2.0) to shorten member_6 and member_7, reducing mass and stress. Keep all other nodes fixed per instructions.",\n  "reasoning": "Increasing node_4 y increases vertical stiffness, reducing compression in member_1. Adjusting node_6 closer to node_4 shortens diagonal members, reducing their stress and mass. Areas remain same to keep mass within limit. Stress in member_2 is low, so no need to reduce area. Maintaining closed truss with current members is feasible with these small nodal moves.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4 from (3.2,4.0) to (3.2,4.2); node_6 from (4.1,1.9) to (4.0,2.0). Recalculate approximate member lengths and masses: member_6 length reduced from ~2.1 to ~1.8, member_7 length similar but slightly shorter. Expect slight mass decrease or stable. Max stress expected to reduce by ~5-10% in member_1 and member_5.",\n  "calculation": "Member lengths: member_1 length fixed (node_1-node_3): 2.0; member_5 (node_3-node_4) length increases slightly, but improved angle reduces stress. Member_6 length reduces from sqrt((4.1-3.2)^2+(1.9-4.0)^2)=~2.1 to sqrt((4.0-3.2)^2+(2.0-4.2)^2)=sqrt(0.8^2+2.2^2)=~2.34 (slightly longer, but better angle). Member_7 length reduces slightly. Mass roughly stable, stress expected to reduce due to better force path.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Adjust node_4 y to 4.2, node_6 to (4.0, 2.0), keep all other nodes fixed. Maintain member areas.
