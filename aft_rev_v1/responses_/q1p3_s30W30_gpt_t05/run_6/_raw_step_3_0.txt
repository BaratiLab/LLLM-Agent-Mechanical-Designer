Member_2 area increased to 3, member_1 area is 2. Node_3 fixed at (2,0), node_1 and node_2 fixed supports. Node_4 at (3,3.5), node_6 at (4,1.5). Members connected to node_4 and node_6 carry significant stress. Adjusting node_4 and node_6 upwards and slightly right can reduce compression in member_1 by redistributing forces. Slightly increasing height of node_4 increases truss depth, improving stress distribution. Node_6 can be moved closer to node_2 horizontally to reduce length and stress in members 6 and 7.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try node_4 y from 3.5 to 3.8, x from 3.0 to 3.2; node_6 y from 1.5 to 1.7, x from 4.0 to 4.3.

Moving node_6 closer to node_2 shortens members 6 and 7, reducing their stress and mass. Area assignments remain same as they meet constraints and mass budget. The structure remains statically determinate and closed. This should reduce max stress below 14.21 while keeping mass under 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths recalculated: member_1 length unchanged (2.0), member_6 length reduced from sqrt((4-4)^2+(1.5-3.5)^2)=2.0 to sqrt((4.3-4)^2+(1.7-3.8)^2)=approx 2.12, slight increase but offset by reduced stress. Member_7 length reduced from sqrt((6-4)^2+(0-1.5)^2)=approx 2.5 to sqrt((6-4.3)^2+(0-1.7)^2)=approx 2.2. Overall mass impact minimal.",\n  \n  "calculation": "New node positions: node_4 (3.2, 3.8), node_6 (4.3, 1.7). Members unchanged: member_1 to member_7 with same areas as iteration 2.
