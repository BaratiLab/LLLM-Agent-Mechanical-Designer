Current max stress 13.53, mass 26.57. Load at node_3 fixed. Support nodes fixed. Node_4 and node_6 can be moved to optimize stress distribution.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_1 (-13.53) and member_5 (-9.39). Members near node_4 and node_6 carry notable stress. Member areas are reasonable; areas 2 and 3 dominate. Mass is below limit but close. Node_4 is relatively high (y=4.3), node_6 near (4.0,1.7). Member_1 (node_1-node_3) has high compressive stress, possibly due to load transfer path. Reducing eccentricity or improving load path by adjusting node_4 and node_6 may reduce stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider lowering node_4 slightly to reduce bending moment and compressive stress on member_1. Adjust node_6 to optimize force flow between node_4 and node_2. Possibly reduce height of node_4 to around 3.8-4.0 and shift node_6 slightly right and lower to reduce stress on members 1 and 5.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Lowering node_4 reduces lever arm for load at node_3 transferred through node_4, reducing compressive stress in member_1. Shifting node_6 slightly right and down improves axial force distribution in members 6 and 7, reducing local stress. Area assignments are kept same as they are efficient. Mass may slightly reduce due to shorter members. Avoid changing load/support nodes. No new members or nodes are added to keep structure closed and simple.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4: y from 4.3 to ~3.9; x fixed at 3.2 for stability. Node_6: from (4.0,1.7) to approx (4.2,1.5).
