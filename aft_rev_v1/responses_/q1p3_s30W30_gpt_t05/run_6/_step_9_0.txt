  "preamble": "Current structure meets constraints; aim to reduce max stress further.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max stress Â±30, max mass 30. Current max stress 13.53, mass 26.57. Load at node_3 fixed. Support nodes fixed. Node_4 and node_6 can be moved to optimize stress distribution.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_1 (-13.53) and member_5 (-9.39). Members near node_4 and node_6 carry notable stress. Member areas are reasonable; areas 2 and 3 dominate. Mass is below limit but close. Node_4 is relatively high (y=4.3), node_6 near (4.0,1.7). Member_1 (node_1-node_3) has high compressive stress, possibly due to load transfer path. Reducing eccentricity or improving load path by adjusting node_4 and node_6 may reduce stress.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider lowering node_4 slightly to reduce bending moment and compressive stress on member_1. Adjust node_6 to optimize force flow between node_4 and node_2. Possibly reduce height of node_4 to around 3.8-4.0 and shift node_6 slightly right and lower to reduce stress on members 1 and 5.",
  
  "reasoning": "Lowering node_4 reduces lever arm for load at node_3 transferred through node_4, reducing compressive stress in member_1. Shifting node_6 slightly right and down improves axial force distribution in members 6 and 7, reducing local stress. Area assignments are kept same as they are efficient. Mass may slightly reduce due to shorter members. Avoid changing load/support nodes. No new members or nodes are added to keep structure closed and simple.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4: y from 4.3 to ~3.9; x fixed at 3.2 for stability. Node_6: from (4.0,1.7) to approx (4.2,1.5). Member lengths recalculated: member_1 length ~2.0, member_5 length reduced slightly, member_6 length slightly increased but area small. Expect max stress to drop below 13.5. Mass should remain < 30.",
  
  "calculation": "Member lengths: member_1: node_1(0,0) to node_3(2,0) = 2.0. Member_5: node_3(2,0) to node_4(3.2,3.9) length = sqrt(1.2^2 + 3.9^2) = ~4.07. Member_6: node_4(3.2,3.9) to node_6(4.2,1.5) length = sqrt(1.0^2 + 2.4^2) = ~2.6. Member_7: node_6(4.2,1.5) to node_2(6,0) length = sqrt(1.8^2 + 1.5^2) = ~2.34. Mass recalculated with areas same as before. Total mass expected ~26.0-26.5. Stress expected to reduce due to better geometry.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Adjust node_4 to (3.2, 3.9), node_6 to (4.2, 1.5). Keep all other nodes same. Keep member areas same. Expect stress reduction and mass within limits. Stop optimization only if further improvements negligible.",
