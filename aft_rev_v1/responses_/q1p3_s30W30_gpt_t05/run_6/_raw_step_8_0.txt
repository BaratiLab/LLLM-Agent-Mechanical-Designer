Load at node_3, supports fixed. Areas fixed. Aim to reduce stress by adjusting node_4 and node_6 positions.",\n  "analysis": "Max stress on member_1 (-13.75) and member_5 (-9.42) are dominant compressive stresses. Members 6 and 7 have zero stress, indicating possible inefficiency or slack. Node_4 and node_6 positions can be adjusted to better distribute forces and reduce peak stresses while keeping mass under 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing height of node_4 slightly may reduce compressive stress in member_1; moving node_6 closer to node_4 and slightly lower may balance forces and activate members 6 and 7 better, reducing stress in main members.",\n  "reasoning": "By increasing node_4 y from 4.1 to about 4.3 and shifting node_6 slightly left and down (x from 4.3 to 4.0, y from 2.0 to 1.7), the truss geometry becomes more triangular and balanced. This should reduce high compressive stress in member_1 and member_5 by redistributing load paths. Members 6 and 7 remain at area 1 to keep mass low. Load and supports remain fixed. Member areas remain same as current iteration to avoid mass increase.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths recalculated approximately. Slight increase in node_4 height increases diagonal lengths but within mass limit. Stress expected to redistribute more evenly, lowering peak compressive stress on member_1 and member_5. Total mass remains near 26, below 30.",\n  "calculation": "Node_4 moved from (3.2,4.1) to (3.2,4.3). Node_6 moved from (4.3,2.0) to (4.0,1.7). Member connections and areas unchanged. Stress expected to reduce from ~13.75 to ~12-13 max. Mass remains under 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no node moves on load/support nodes. No duplicate nodes or members. Areas remain valid.
