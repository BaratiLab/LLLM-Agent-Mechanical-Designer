  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 and node_6 positions to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 14.55 < 30, total mass 24.24 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Nodes 1,2 fixed. Only node_4 and node_6 movable. Members and areas fixed. Goal: reduce max stress further while maintaining constraints.",

  "analysis": "Max compressive stress at member_1 (-14.55) and tensile at member_3 (3.63). Member_1 is critical. Node_4 and node_6 positions influence stress distribution. Current node_4 at (3.2,3.5), node_6 at (4.0,1.7). Mass is moderate, so reducing stress by slightly adjusting node_4 upward and node_6 closer to node_4 may improve load path and reduce stress concentration on member_1.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Try increasing node_4 y-coordinate to raise the truss arch, improving force distribution. Move node_6 slightly right and down to better support node_2. Check if these changes reduce member_1 stress and keep mass under 30.",

  "reasoning": "Raising node_4 increases triangle height, reducing axial force on member_1. Adjusting node_6 closer to node_4 and node_2 improves load transfer. Keep node_3 and supports fixed. Maintain connectivity and no duplicate members. Areas remain same. Node_4 y from 3.5 to ~3.8, node_6 x from 4.0 to ~4.1, y from 1.7 to ~1.6.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "New node_4: (3.2, 3.8), node_6: (4.1, 1.6). Members unchanged. Calculate member lengths and masses roughly: member_1 length ~ distance node_1-node_3 = 2.0, same. Member_3 length node_1-node_4 increases slightly, mass increases slightly but within limits. Expected stress reduction in member_1 from better geometry.",

  "calculation": "Member_1 length unchanged, area_id=2 (0.782). Member_3 length increases from ~4.03 to ~4.36, mass increases by ~0.4 but total mass still < 30. Expected stress in member_1 reduces from 14.55 to ~13.0-13.5. Member_5 and others remain similar. Total mass estimated ~24.5. Constraints satisfied.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 y increased to 3.8, node_6 moved to (4.1,1.6). Members unchanged. Areas unchanged. Expected stress reduction in critical member. Mass within limit. No duplicate nodes or members. Load and supports fixed.",
