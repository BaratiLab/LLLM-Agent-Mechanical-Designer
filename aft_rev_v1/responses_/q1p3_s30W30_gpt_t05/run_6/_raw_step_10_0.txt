Load at node_3, supports fixed. Nodes at load/support fixed; optimize free nodes.",\n  "analysis": "Max stress is dominated by member_1 (-13.99), compression. Members 6 and 7 have zero stress, suggesting possible overcapacity or inefficient layout. Mass is under limit but can be reduced. Node_4 and node_6 positions can be adjusted to better distribute forces and reduce stress in member_1 and others. Areas assigned are moderate; consider if area reduction is possible for low-stress members. The truss is closed and stable.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on moving node_4 and node_6 slightly to reduce member_1 compression. Possibly lower node_4 y-coordinate to reduce bending moment at node_1. Node_6 can be shifted closer to line between node_4 and node_2 to improve force flow. Keep areas as is or reduce area for members 6 and 7 due to zero stress.",\n  "reasoning": "Member_1 is highly compressed; reducing its length or changing geometry to share load can reduce stress. Node_4 is currently at (3.2,3.9) - lowering it toward 3.2,3.5 reduces lever arm effect. Node_6 at (4.2,1.5) can move closer to (4.0,1.7) to improve force path. Members 6 and 7 can have area reduced from \'1\' (0.195) to \'0\' (1) is larger, so keep or reduce if stress zero. However, zero stress suggests area can be reduced to minimum (0.195).",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: approximate for member_1 (node_1 to node_3) fixed at 2.0 units. Member_3 (node_1 to node_4) length ~ sqrt(3.2^2 + 3.9^2)=5.06. Reducing node_4 y to 3.5 reduces length to ~4.3. Member_6 and 7 lengths ~ node_4 to node_6 and node_6 to node_2. Adjust node_6 to (4.0,1.7) reduces member_6 length and possibly stress. Areas: members 6 and 7 area set to \'0\' (1) or \'1\' (0.195) to reduce mass without increasing stress.",\n  "calculation": "Adjust node_4 to (3.2, 3.5), node_6 to (4.0, 1.7). Reduce areas of members 6 and 7 from \'1\' (0.195) to \'0\' (1) is larger area. So reduce from \'1\' to \'0\' is increase area, so better to keep area \'1\' or reduce to \'1\' (0.195) if stress zero. Use \'1\' area for members 6 and 7 to minimize mass. Other members keep areas as is. Estimated mass slightly reduced due to shorter member_3 length. Expected max stress to reduce slightly due to geometry change.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 lowered to reduce bending, node_6 moved closer for better force path.
