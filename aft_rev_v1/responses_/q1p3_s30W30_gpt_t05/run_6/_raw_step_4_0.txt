Nodes node_4 and node_6 can be moved to improve stress distribution. Members with high stress are between node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_4. Increasing vertical height of node_4 slightly could reduce compressive stress in member_1 by improving force path. Adjusting node_6 closer to node_4 may redistribute forces and reduce stress in member_5.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try increasing node_4 y from 3.8 to ~4.0, node_6 y from 1.7 to ~1.9, and x of node_6 slightly left to 4.1 to shorten member_6 and member_7, possibly reducing stress in member_5 and member_1.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Increasing height of node_4 increases lever arm for load transfer, reducing compressive stress in member_1.
