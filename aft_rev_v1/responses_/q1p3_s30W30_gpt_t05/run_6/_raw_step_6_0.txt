Areas mostly fixed; can adjust node_4 and node_6 positions only.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress concentrated in member_1 (-13.635) and member_5 (-9.404). Members with area 3 and 2 dominate mass. Node_4 and node_6 positions influence force distribution. Increasing height of node_4 slightly increased stress; lowering it may reduce stress. Node_6 near node_2 affects load path.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try lowering node_4 from 4.2 to ~3.7-3.9 and move node_6 slightly closer to node_4 and node_2 to optimize force paths.

Moving node_6 closer to node_2 may reduce member_7 length and mass. Avoid large shifts to maintain closed truss and avoid instability.

Member_5 length ~ sqrt((3.2-2)^2+(3.8-0)^2)=~4.0 vs previous 4.4, reduces force and stress. Member_6 and 7 lengths slightly shorter. Total mass estimated ~25.5 (reduced).
