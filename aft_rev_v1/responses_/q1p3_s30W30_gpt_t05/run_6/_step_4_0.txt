  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 and node_6 positions to reduce max stress while keeping mass under 30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 14.12 < 30, total mass 25.077 < 30, load at node_3 fixed, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Areas mostly small to medium.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is primarily compressive on member_1 (-14.1187) and member_5 (-9.4824). Tensile stresses are moderate. Mass is well below max. Nodes node_4 and node_6 can be moved to improve stress distribution. Members with high stress are between node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_4. Increasing vertical height of node_4 slightly could reduce compressive stress in member_1 by improving force path. Adjusting node_6 closer to node_4 may redistribute forces and reduce stress in member_5.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try increasing node_4 y from 3.8 to ~4.0, node_6 y from 1.7 to ~1.9, and x of node_6 slightly left to 4.1 to shorten member_6 and member_7, possibly reducing stress in member_5 and member_1.",

  "reasoning": "Increasing height of node_4 increases lever arm for load transfer, reducing compressive stress in member_1. Moving node_6 closer to node_4 and slightly left reduces length and stress in members connected to node_6. Area assignments remain the same to keep mass stable. Slight node repositioning respects load/support constraints and maintains closed truss geometry.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3=2.0, node_3-node_2=4.0, node_1-node_4 ~3.2-3.3, node_4-node_2 ~3.2-3.3, node_3-node_4 ~3.5-3.6, node_4-node_6 ~1.8, node_6-node_2 ~1.9. Areas: member_1=2(0.782), member_2=3(1.759), member_3=3(1.759), member_4=2(0.782), member_5=2(0.782), member_6=1(0.195), member_7=1(0.195).",

  "calculation": "New node_4: (3.2,4.0), node_6: (4.1,1.9). Recalculate lengths: node_1-node_4=4.0, node_4-node_6=2.26, node_6-node_2=2.07. Mass approx sum(length*area): member_1=2*0.782=1.564, member_2=4*1.759=7.036, member_3=4*1.759=7.036, member_4=3.2*0.782=2.5, member_5=3.6*0.782=2.8, member_6=2.26*0.195=0.44, member_7=2.07*0.195=0.40, total ~23.3 < 25.077 previous, still < 30 max mass. Stress expected to reduce due to better geometry and force distribution.",
