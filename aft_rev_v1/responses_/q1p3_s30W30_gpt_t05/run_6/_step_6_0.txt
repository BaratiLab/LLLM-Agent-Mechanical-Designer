  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 and node_6 positions to reduce max stress and mass within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 13.64 < 30, mass 26.259 < 30, load at node_3, supports fixed. Areas mostly fixed; can adjust node_4 and node_6 positions only.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress concentrated in member_1 (-13.635) and member_5 (-9.404). Members with area 3 and 2 dominate mass. Node_4 and node_6 positions influence force distribution. Increasing height of node_4 slightly increased stress; lowering it may reduce stress. Node_6 near node_2 affects load path.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try lowering node_4 from 4.2 to ~3.7-3.9 and move node_6 slightly closer to node_4 and node_2 to optimize force paths. Keep node_3 fixed at (2,0).",
  
  "reasoning": "Lowering node_4 reduces lever arm, potentially reducing stress in member_1 and member_5. Moving node_6 closer to node_2 may reduce member_7 length and mass. Avoid large shifts to maintain closed truss and avoid instability. Maintain area assignments to keep mass under limit.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths and forces with node_4 at (3.2,3.8), node_6 at (4.1,1.8). Recalculate member lengths, estimate mass and approximate stress reduction by shorter members and better force distribution.",
  
  "calculation": "Member_1 length ~ sqrt((2-0)^2+(0-0)^2)=2.0, stays same. Member_5 length ~ sqrt((3.2-2)^2+(3.8-0)^2)=~4.0 vs previous 4.4, reduces force and stress. Member_6 and 7 lengths slightly shorter. Total mass estimated ~25.5 (reduced). Max stress expected to drop ~5-10%.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New node positions: node_4 (3.2, 3.8), node_6 (4.1, 1.8). Members unchanged. Areas unchanged. Expect max stress ~12.5, mass ~25.5. Constraints met. Further optimization possible but diminishing returns.",
