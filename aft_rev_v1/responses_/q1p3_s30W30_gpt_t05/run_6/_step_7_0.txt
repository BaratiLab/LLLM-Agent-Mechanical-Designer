  "preamble": "Optimize node positions to reduce max stress while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 14.12 well below ±30, total mass 25.084 below 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Nodes node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_4 and node_6 movable. Members use areas mostly 1,2,3.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress concentrated in member_1 (-14.12), a compression member from node_1 to node_3. Member_5 also has notable compression (-9.48). Members 6 and 7 have negligible stress, indicating potential to reduce their area or adjust geometry. Node_4 and node_6 positions can be optimized to reduce stress in critical members by improving force paths. Current design is stable but can be further optimized by slightly adjusting node_4 and node_6 to reduce bending and stress concentration.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing compression in member_1 by slightly raising node_4 to better transfer load, and adjust node_6 to optimize force flow to node_2. Consider decreasing area in low stress members 6 and 7 if possible. Maintain closed truss and no new members.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_1 stress is highest compressive; increasing vertical height of node_4 can reduce axial load in member_1 by distributing load more through node_4. Moving node_6 slightly closer to node_2 and upward can improve load transfer and reduce bending in members 6 and 7. Areas remain same to avoid mass increase. Node_3 fixed due to load, node_1 and node_2 fixed due to supports. Small position adjustments within ±0.5 allowed for node_4 and node_6. Member connectivity unchanged to maintain closed truss.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4 from (3.2,3.8) to ~ (3.2,4.1), node_6 from (4.1,1.8) to (4.3,2.0). Expect member_1 stress to reduce from -14.12 to ~ -12, mass stable ~25.1. Member_6 and 7 stress remain negligible, possibly reduce area in next iteration if stress <1. Current areas kept same for stability.",
  
  "calculation": "Adjusted node_4 y from 3.8 to 4.1 (+0.3), node_6 x from 4.1 to 4.3 (+0.2), y from 1.8 to 2.0 (+0.2). Member lengths slightly increased but better load distribution expected. Areas unchanged: member_1 area '2', member_2 area '3', member_3 area '3', member_4 area '2', member_5 area '2', member_6 area '1', member_7 area '1'. Total mass ~25.1, max stress expected <14.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New node positions maintain load/support nodes fixed, no duplicate nodes/members, closed truss intact. Constraints satisfied. Stress reduction expected. Further optimization possible but diminishing returns. Stop not recommended yet.",
