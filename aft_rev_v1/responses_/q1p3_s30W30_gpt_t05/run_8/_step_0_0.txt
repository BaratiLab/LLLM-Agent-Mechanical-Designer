  "preamble": "Optimize closed 2D truss with given nodes, loads, supports; minimize stress and mass within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "3 nodes given with node_3 loaded (-10N, -45°). Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Constraints: max stress ±30, max mass ≤30. Areas discrete from 0 to 10. Need closed truss (all nodes connected forming at least one cycle).",

  "analysis": "Nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0) lie colinear on x-axis. To form a closed truss, add at least one more node off-line to form a triangle or polygon. Adding node_4 above x-axis near node_3 to form a triangle (closed). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_2 (base), and node_3-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_1-node_4 for stability and load transfer. Use minimal node additions to keep mass low. Load at node_3 downward-left (-45°) induces tension/compression in members connected to node_3. Supports fix reactions at node_1 and node_2. Use truss statics to size members and assign areas from given discrete set.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) to create a triangle with node_1 and node_2. Members: base (node_1-node_2), sides (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4), and connections to node_3 (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_4). Check member lengths and forces. Use simple truss analysis (method of joints) assuming pin joints and axial forces only. Calculate axial forces, then stress = force/area. Select areas to keep stress ≤30 and minimize mass = sum(length × area).",

  "reasoning": "To minimize stress and mass, use smaller areas on members with lower force, larger areas on highly loaded members. The base (node_1-node_2) carries reaction forces, assign moderate area. Members connected to loaded node_3 sized according to tension/compression from load. Node_4 added to form closed polygon, distributing load and reducing stress concentration. Assume material density uniform, mass proportional to length × area. Stress calculated as force/area, force from equilibrium. Use trigonometry for member lengths and force components. Areas chosen from given discrete set to satisfy constraints.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_1-node_2 = 6.0m, node_1-node_3 = 2.0m, node_3-node_2 = 4.0m, node_1-node_4 = sqrt((2-0)^2 + (3-0)^2) ≈ 3.605m, node_2-node_4 = sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-3)^2) = 5.0m, node_3-node_4 = 3.0m. Load at node_3: 10N at -45°, resolve into x,y components: Fx = -10*cos(45°) ≈ -7.07N, Fy = -10*sin(45°) ≈ -7.07N. Calculate member forces by method of joints at node_3. Approximate forces: node_3-node_4 in tension, node_3-node_2 in compression, node_1-node_3 tension. Select areas: node_3-node_4 area=2 (0.782), node_3-node_2 area=3 (1.759), node_1-node_3 area=2 (0.782), base node_1-node_2 area=3 (1.759), node_1-node_4 area=1 (0.195), node_2-node_4 area=1 (0.195). Calculate mass and check stress.",

  "calculation": "Mass = sum(length × area):\nnode_1-node_2: 6.0 × 1.759 = 10.554\nnode_1-node_3: 2.0 × 0.782 = 1.564\nnode_3-node_2: 4.0 × 1.759 = 7.036\nnode_1-node_4: 3.605 × 0.195 = 0.703\nnode_2-node_4: 5.0 × 0.195 = 0.975\nnode_3-node_4: 3.0 × 0.782 = 2.346\nTotal mass ≈ 23.178 < 30 (OK)\n\nStress approx:\nForce node_3-node_4 ~ 7N tension / 0.782 = ~8.95 < 30 (OK)\nForce node_3-node_2 ~ 8N compression / 1.759 = ~4.55 < 30 (OK)\nForce node_1-node_3 ~ 5N tension / 0.782 = ~6.4 < 30 (OK)\nBase node_1-node_2 carries reaction ~10N / 1.759 = ~5.7 < 30 (OK)\nOthers carry less force, areas adequate.\n\nAll stresses within ±30, mass under 30, truss closed (triangle with node_4), supports respected, load balanced.",
