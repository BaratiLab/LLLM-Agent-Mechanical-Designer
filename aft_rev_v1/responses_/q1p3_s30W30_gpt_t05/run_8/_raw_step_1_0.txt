Node_3 at load, node_1 and node_2 fixed supports. Node_4 can move.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_4 has highest stress (29.05) near tensile limit. Members 5 and 6 also high stress. Member_1 low stress (-2.29). Load at node_3 pulls down-left at 45Â°. Current geometry places node_4 at (2,3) causing high stress in members connecting to node_4. Node_4 position influences stress distribution in top members. Areas chosen are moderate to high (1,2,3).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Moving node_4 slightly left and down to reduce tension in member_4 and member_5. Possibly increase area in members 4 and 5 to reduce stress. Reduce area in low stress members like member_1 to save mass. Member_6 compression (-9.04) is moderate.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "By moving node_4 closer horizontally to node_1 and node_2, the length and force distribution in members 4 and 5 can be improved, reducing peak stress. Adjusting cross-sectional areas in high stress members to a higher area while reducing in low stress members balances mass and stress. Node_3 fixed due to load; node_1 and node_2 fixed due to supports. Node_4 movement is only option. Keep closed truss topology. Maintain area selections from given discrete set.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: currently member_4 and member_5 are length ~3.0 and 4.0 approx. Reducing height of node_4 from 3.0 to ~2.5 reduces length and tension. Increase area of member_4 and member_5 from \'1\'(0.195) to \'2\'(0.782) or \'3\'(1.759) to reduce stress. Reduce area of member_1 from \'3\'(1.759) to \'2\'(0.782) to save mass. Member_2 and member_6 moderate area \'2\'(0.782). Member_3 keep as \'3\'(1.759).",\n  \n  "calculation": "New node_4 at (1.8, 2.5).
