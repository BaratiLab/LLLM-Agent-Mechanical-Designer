  "preamble": "Current design meets constraints with low stress and acceptable mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Goal is to minimize stress within max ±30 and mass ≤30. Current max stress 9.72 well below limit, mass 29.27 close to max. Load at node_3, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_4 moved from (2,3) to (1.8,2.5) improved stress significantly.",
  "analysis": "Stress reduced from 29.05 to 9.72 by moving node_4 closer to the base and adjusting areas. Mass increased but still within limit. No member exceeds ±30 stress. Structure is statically determinate and stable with current triangular topology and cross members. Further node movement restricted by fixed load/support nodes.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further movement of node_4 may reduce mass but risks increasing stress. Current stress margin is large, so mass could be reduced by slightly reducing areas but risk is minimal. Given current design, stress is minimized effectively.",
  "reasoning": "Optimizing node_4 position closer to base reduced bending moments and stress. Member areas selected to balance mass and strength. Member_2 and member_6 have highest compressive stress near -9.7, still safe. Member_1 and others have low stress. Mass close to max indicates efficient use of material.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length and area product gives mass. Areas chosen from discrete set. Stress proportional to force and inversely to area. Current area assignments adequate. Further reductions in area risk stress violation. Node_4 position optimized for load path and force distribution.",
  "calculation": "No further node movement possible for load/support nodes. Node_4 at (1.8,2.5) optimal from iteration_1. Member areas: member_1 (area 2), member_2 (2), member_3 (3), member_4 (3), member_5 (3), member_6 (2). Total mass 29.2695 < 30, max stress 9.72 < 30. All constraints met.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Design is optimal given constraints, load, and support conditions. Stress and mass balanced. No duplicate nodes or members. Node positions precise. No further improvements expected.",
