Need closed truss (all nodes connected forming at least one cycle).",\n\n  "analysis": "Nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0) lie colinear on x-axis. To form a closed truss, add at least one more node off-line to form a triangle or polygon. Adding node_4 above x-axis near node_3 to form a triangle (closed). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_2 (base), and node_3-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_1-node_4 for stability and load transfer. Use minimal node additions to keep mass low. Load at node_3 downward-left (-45°) induces tension/compression in members connected to node_3. Supports fix reactions at node_1 and node_2. Use truss statics to size members and assign areas from given discrete set.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) to create a triangle with node_1 and node_2. Members: base (node_1-node_2), sides (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4), and connections to node_3 (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_4). Check member lengths and forces. Use simple truss analysis (method of joints) assuming pin joints and axial forces only. Calculate axial forces, then stress = force/area. Select areas to keep stress ≤30 and minimize mass = sum(length × area).",\n\n  "reasoning": "To minimize stress and mass, use smaller areas on members with lower force, larger areas on highly loaded members. The base (node_1-node_2) carries reaction forces, assign moderate area. Members connected to loaded node_3 sized according to tension/compression from load. Node_4 added to form closed polygon, distributing load and reducing stress concentration. Assume material density uniform, mass proportional to length × area. Stress calculated as force/area, force from equilibrium. Use trigonometry for member lengths and force components.

Load at node_3: 10N at -45°, resolve into x,y components: Fx = -10*cos(45°) ≈ -7.07N, Fy = -10*sin(45°) ≈ -7.07N. Calculate member forces by method of joints at node_3.
