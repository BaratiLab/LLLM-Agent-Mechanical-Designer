  "preamble": "Optimize truss by reducing max stress and redistributing forces.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress near limit (29.05), total mass 23.18 < 30. Node_3 at load, node_1 and node_2 fixed supports. Node_4 can move.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_4 has highest stress (29.05) near tensile limit. Members 5 and 6 also high stress. Member_1 low stress (-2.29). Load at node_3 pulls down-left at 45Â°. Current geometry places node_4 at (2,3) causing high stress in members connecting to node_4. Node_4 position influences stress distribution in top members. Areas chosen are moderate to high (1,2,3).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Moving node_4 slightly left and down to reduce tension in member_4 and member_5. Possibly increase area in members 4 and 5 to reduce stress. Reduce area in low stress members like member_1 to save mass. Member_6 compression (-9.04) is moderate.",
  
  "reasoning": "By moving node_4 closer horizontally to node_1 and node_2, the length and force distribution in members 4 and 5 can be improved, reducing peak stress. Adjusting cross-sectional areas in high stress members to a higher area while reducing in low stress members balances mass and stress. Node_3 fixed due to load; node_1 and node_2 fixed due to supports. Node_4 movement is only option. Keep closed truss topology. Maintain area selections from given discrete set.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: currently member_4 and member_5 are length ~3.0 and 4.0 approx. Reducing height of node_4 from 3.0 to ~2.5 reduces length and tension. Increase area of member_4 and member_5 from '1'(0.195) to '2'(0.782) or '3'(1.759) to reduce stress. Reduce area of member_1 from '3'(1.759) to '2'(0.782) to save mass. Member_2 and member_6 moderate area '2'(0.782). Member_3 keep as '3'(1.759).",
  
  "calculation": "New node_4 at (1.8, 2.5). Member areas: member_1: '2'(0.782), member_2: '2'(0.782), member_3: '3'(1.759), member_4: '3'(1.759), member_5: '3'(1.759), member_6: '2'(0.782). Expect stress in member_4 and 5 reduced due to area increase and node_4 position. Mass estimate: sum(length*area) approx 22-24, within 30 limit. Max stress should reduce below 29.05.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Check no duplicate nodes or members. Node_3, node_1, node_2 fixed. Node_4 moved. Areas selected from allowed set. Closed truss maintained with 6 members. Mass and stress constraints expected met. Proceed with iteration.",
