Current max stress 60.44 > 30, mass 5.3 < 30. Need to reduce stress by better force distribution, possibly adding nodes and members.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high compressive stress (-60.44) in member_1 (node_1-node_3). Members from node_3 to nodes 1,2,4 carry load but member_1 overstressed. Member_3 with largest area (2) still low stress. Mass is low, so can increase area selectively. Node_4 is at (3,3) providing some triangulation but stress in member_4 is 34.2 >30 tensile. Structure lacks sufficient triangulation near node_3 to distribute load. Load at node_3 is near bottom chord, causing high stress in member_1.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress in member_1, add a node above node_3 to create a vertical member and additional triangulation. This will reduce bending and compressive load in member_1. Also, increase cross-sectional areas in critical members but keep mass under 30. Reposition node_4 slightly to optimize angles and add one more node between node_3 and node_4 for better load path.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (2.0, 1.5) above node_3. Connect node_5 to node_1, node_2, and node_4. Increase area of members connected to node_3 and node_5 to reduce stress. Adjust member areas: members from node_3 to node_5 and node_5 to supports use larger area. Keep bottom chord members with moderate areas. Remove member_3 (node_3-node_4) to avoid redundant path and reduce stress concentration.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 above node_3 creates a vertical web member reducing compressive stress in member_1 by transferring load vertically. Additional triangulation with node_5 improves force distribution. Increasing area in critical members reduces stress. Removing member_3 avoids stress concentration and redundant load path. Positioning node_5 midway vertically balances geometry and force transfer. Mass budget allows these changes.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3: 2.0m, node_3-node_2: 4.0m, node_3-node_5: 1.5m, node_5-node_1: sqrt(2²+1.5²)=2.5m approx, node_5-node_2: sqrt(4²+1.5²)=4.27m approx, node_5-node_4: sqrt((3-2)²+(3-1.5)²)=1.8m approx, node_1-node_4: 3.6m approx, node_2-node_4: 3.6m approx.
