Node_5 and node_6 addition improved load path and reduced stress. Areas selected are appropriate for member forces. Mass is under limit.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further node repositioning risks breaking closed topology or increasing stress. Current members and node layout efficiently transfer loads with minimal stress.",\n  "reasoning": "Load is applied at node_3 and supported at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). The added intermediate nodes (node_5, node_6) create a stable triangular substructure distributing forces evenly. Member areas are selected to maintain stresses well below Â±30. Mass is optimized under 30. Moving intermediate nodes further is unlikely to yield significant stress reduction without increasing mass or losing closure.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas produce the given member masses. Stress magnitudes are low, indicating no need for larger areas. Node_5 and node_6 positions at (2.5,1.5) and (2.5,2.25) create efficient force paths. No members exceed stress limits.
