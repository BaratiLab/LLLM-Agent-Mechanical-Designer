  "preamble": "Current 2D truss design meets constraints with minimized stress.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 6.33 < 30, total mass 21.44 < 30, all stresses low and balanced, no overstressed members.",
  "analysis": "The structure has evolved from high stress and uneven distribution to a balanced stress state with low max stress. Node_5 and node_6 addition improved load path and reduced stress. Areas selected are appropriate for member forces. Mass is under limit.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further node repositioning risks breaking closed topology or increasing stress. Current members and node layout efficiently transfer loads with minimal stress.",
  "reasoning": "Load is applied at node_3 and supported at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). The added intermediate nodes (node_5, node_6) create a stable triangular substructure distributing forces evenly. Member areas are selected to maintain stresses well below Â±30. Mass is optimized under 30. Moving intermediate nodes further is unlikely to yield significant stress reduction without increasing mass or losing closure.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas produce the given member masses. Stress magnitudes are low, indicating no need for larger areas. Node_5 and node_6 positions at (2.5,1.5) and (2.5,2.25) create efficient force paths. No members exceed stress limits. Total mass 21.44 < 30 ensures material efficiency.",
  "calculation": "Verifying member stresses and masses: max stress 6.33 < 30, total mass 21.4388 < 30. Member areas from set {0..10} chosen correctly. No node moves allowed at load/support nodes, intermediate nodes well placed. Closed structure maintained with members connecting all nodes without duplication.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints satisfied: max stress and mass limits met, closed topology intact, no duplicate nodes or members, load and support nodes fixed. Optimization converged.",
