Constraints: max stress ±30, max mass 30. Current design exceeds stress and mass limits.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current max stress -64.91 exceeds ±30 limit. Total mass 20.55 is under 30 but member stresses show member_1 highly overstressed. Members with area 3 are heavy and still overstressed. The load at node_3 causes high compression in member_1. Node_5 addition increased mass and did not reduce max stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce high stress in member_1 and member_2 by adding intermediate nodes or redistributing forces. Use smaller cross sections on low-stress members to reduce mass. Possibly add a diagonal member from node_3 to node_4 or node_5 to better distribute load. Avoid member_5,6,7 with large area 3 if possible to reduce mass.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_5 to reduce complexity and mass. Add a new node between node_3 and node_4 to create a triangular truss improving load path. Use smaller cross-sectional areas for members under low stress. Increase area on critical compression members but keep within area 2 or 3 to control mass. Connect nodes: member_1 (node_1-node_3), member_2 (node_3-node_2), member_3 (node_1-node_4), member_4 (node_2-node_4), member_5 (node_3-node_4_new), member_6 (node_4_new-node_4).",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding a node between node_3 and node_4 creates a more efficient load path, reducing stress on member_1. Reducing member areas where possible lowers mass. Using area 2 (0.782) or 3 (1.759) balances strength and mass. Avoid large area 3 members where smaller areas suffice. The triangular geometry formed by nodes 1,3,new node,4,2 distributes forces better under the angled load at node_3.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check length of members for mass calculation.
