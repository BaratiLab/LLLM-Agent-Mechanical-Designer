Current max stress 38.22 (exceeds limit), mass 11.94 (within limit). Load at node_3 downward-left. Need to reduce stress in members 5 and 6.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design places node_5 at (2.5,1.5) with small area members (area_id \'1\') connecting node_3-node_5 and node_5-node_4. These members have stress -38.22 exceeding allowable stress. Members 1-4 use area_id \'2\' with moderate area. The truss is a simple triangular frame with an internal node_5. Stress concentration at members connected to node_5 suggests load transfer inefficiency and insufficient cross-sectional area or suboptimal geometry. Mass is below max, so can increase member areas moderately. Node_5 position can be adjusted to better distribute load. Adding an additional node to create a stiffer structure could help reduce stress. Avoid increasing mass above 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increase area of members 5 and 6 to reduce stress, reposition node_5 slightly upward and closer to node_4 to improve load path. Add one more node above node_5 to triangulate load transfer. Keep supports and load nodes fixed. Use area_id up to \'3\' or \'4\' for critical members. Check member lengths to estimate mass. Remove redundant members if any.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_6 at (2.5, 2.25) above node_5 to form a stiffer internal triangle. Connect node_3-node_6, node_6-node_4, node_5-node_6. Increase area of members connected to node_5 and node_6 to \'3\' or \'4\'. Remove member_6 (node_5-node_4) to reduce redundancy and stress concentration. Keep other members as is, but increase area of members 5 and new members to reduce stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_6 creates a more triangular internal bracing, improving load distribution and reducing stress in members 5 and 6. Increasing cross-sectional area reduces stress while keeping mass under limit. Removing member_6 reduces redundant load path causing stress concentration. Positioning node_6 above node_5 shortens critical members and improves force flow. This approach balances mass and stress constraints effectively.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_3(2,0)-node_5(2.5,1.5) ~1.58, node_5(2.5,1.5)-node_6(2.5,2.25)=0.75, node_6(2.5,2.25)-node_4(3,3)=~0.9. Assign area_id \'3\' (1.759) or \'4\' (3.128) to critical members to reduce stress. Check total mass: sum(length * area). Existing members 1-4 with area_id \'2\' (0.782) remain.
