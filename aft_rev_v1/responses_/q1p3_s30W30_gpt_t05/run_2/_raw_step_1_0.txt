Current max stress 52.38 exceeds ±30 limit; mass 5.19 < 30 limit.

The load at node_3 produces significant force in members connected to node_1. Member_5 (node_3-node_4) is largest area (2) but low stress (-9). The structure is a simple trapezoid with a diagonal. To reduce stress, redistribute force by adding a node above node_3 to create a more triangular truss, improving load path and reducing member lengths and stresses. Keep supports and load nodes fixed. Use smaller areas where possible to reduce mass but ensure stress limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding node_5 above node_3 around y=4.0, connecting node_5 to node_1, node_4, and node_2 to form triangles.

Check lengths and stresses with new geometry.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (2.0, 4.0).

Assign areas to keep stress within ±30 and mass <30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Introducing node_5 above node_3 creates additional load paths, reducing stress in members connected to node_1 and node_3.
