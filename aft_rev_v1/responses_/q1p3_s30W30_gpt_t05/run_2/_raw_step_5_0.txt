Constraints: max stress ±30, max mass 30. Current max stress slightly exceeds limit (30.22).",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current design has max stress at member_7 (30.2182) slightly above limit and total mass 15.35 well below max 30. Members with area_id \'1\' (0.195 area) are highly stressed. Load is at node_3 between supports at node_1 and node_2, nodes 4 and 5 act as upper chord nodes. Slightly adjusting node_4 and node_5 positions and increasing areas on critical tension/compression members may reduce stress peaks. Also, adding a diagonal member from node_1 to node_5 can improve load path and reduce stress concentration on member_7.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing stress in member_7 by adding member_8 (node_1-node_5). Increase area of members under high stress (member_7 from \'1\' to \'2\', member_6 from \'1\' to \'2\'). Slightly raise node_5 to improve geometry. Maintain or slightly reduce areas on low-stress members to keep mass under limit.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Add member_8 from node_1 to node_5 with area \'2\'. Increase area of member_7 and member_6 to \'2\'. Adjust node_5 position to (4.3, 3.1) to improve force distribution. Keep other nodes fixed as per constraints. Remove member_5 (node_4-node_2) to reduce redundant load path and mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Adding member_8 creates a triangulated support between node_1 and node_5, reducing stress on member_7. Increasing cross-sectional areas on members experiencing near-limit stresses reduces stress by increasing capacity. Slightly raising node_5 improves geometry for load transfer. Removing member_5 reduces mass and potential stress concentration. This approach balances mass and stress constraints effectively.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas recalculated.
