Current max stress 36.26 >30, mass 12.918 <30. Load at node_3 downward-left. Supports at nodes 1 (pinned), 2 (roller). Existing nodes mostly on x=2 vertical line causing high stress on member_5.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has excessive compressive stress on member_5 (-36.26) connecting node_3 to node_5 (vertical). Large area (1) and length cause stress concentration. Members connecting node_5 to node_2 and node_1 have large areas (2) and contribute to mass. The vertical alignment of nodes 3,4,5 causes inefficient load path. Need to reduce stress on member_5 and redistribute forces. Also, member_1 area (2) is large; can reduce if forces lower.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Options: move node_5 horizontally to reduce vertical member length; add diagonal members from node_3 to node_2 or node_4; reduce areas on low stress members; remove redundant members to reduce mass. Keep load/support nodes fixed.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node_6 slightly right and up from node_3 to create a triangular load path. Remove node_5 to avoid high compressive stress. Connect node_3 to node_6, node_6 to node_4 and node_2, node_4 to node_2, node_1 to node_4, node_1 to node_3, node_3 to node_2. Adjust member areas to lower levels where stress is low and increase where needed, keeping max stress ≤30 and total mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular truss is statically determinate and efficient for vertical and horizontal loads. Introducing node_6 breaks long vertical member and redistributes load through diagonals, reducing compressive stress. Reducing member areas on low stress members reduces mass. Keeping node_3 and node_4 positions but adding node_6 right and up creates better force flow. Members connecting to supports remain to ensure equilibrium.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Estimate member lengths and assign areas: use areas from {0:1,1:0.195,2:0.782}.
