Node_3 carries load, so members connected to it must resist load with stress ≤30. Mass depends on member lengths × area. Use minimal areas where possible to reduce mass but ensure stress limits. Triangular truss shape is optimal for stability and stress distribution. Place one additional node above node_3 to form two triangles: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_3-node_4-node_2. This creates a stable truss with 4 nodes and 5 members total (including base members).",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding node_4 above node_3 at y>0.
