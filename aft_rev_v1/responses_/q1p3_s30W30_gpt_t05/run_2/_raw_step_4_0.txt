Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_3 and supports fixed, others movable.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress is near limit at members 6 and 7 (±29.05). Mass is moderate. Members 6 and 7 are minimal area (1), but stressed near limit. Members 1 and 4 have larger areas (3) and moderate stress. Members 2 and 3 have area 2 with low stress. Member 5 area 1 has -20 stress, could be optimized. Node_5 moved to (4,3) from (2,4) previously to reduce stress. Need to redistribute forces to reduce stress peaks in members 6 and 7.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Members 6 and 7 connect node_3 to node_5 and node_1 to node_4 respectively. Both at stress limit but opposite sign. Possibly redistribute geometry to reduce tension/compression in these members. Area increase not preferred as mass would increase. Slight node movements (node_4, node_5) to better align load paths may help.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Since node_3 and supports fixed, optimize node_4 and node_5 positions to reduce stress concentration. Member 6 (node_3-node_5) and member 7 (node_1-node_4) at limits suggests these diagonals carry peak load. Moving node_4 slightly closer to node_3 horizontally may reduce member_7 stress. Moving node_5 slightly lower and closer to node_2 may reduce member_6 stress. Maintain closed truss shape with members intact. Areas mostly minimal or moderate; no need to increase areas. Mass is well below max, so small geometry changes allowed.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Keep node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0) fixed. Move node_4 from (2,3) to (2.1, 2.8). Move node_5 from (4,3) to (4.3, 2.7). This reduces diagonal lengths and may balance stresses. Check member lengths and estimate mass: lengths slightly reduced for members 6 and 7, mass may reduce slightly or remain similar. Stress expected to reduce due to better force distribution.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths: m6 (node_3-node_5): from sqrt((4-2)^2+(3-0)^2)=~3.605 to sqrt((4.3-2)^2+(2.7-0)^2)=~3.39. Member 7 (node_1-node_4): from sqrt((2-0)^2+3^2)=3.605 to sqrt((2.1-0)^2+2.8^2)=~3.42. Slight length reduction. Areas unchanged. Mass ~ similar or slightly less. Stress expected to reduce from 29.05 to ~25 max due to geometry improvement. Other members minor changes.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Moved node_4 and node_5 slightly closer to reduce diagonal stresses. Areas unchanged. Mass remains under 16.2 < 30.
