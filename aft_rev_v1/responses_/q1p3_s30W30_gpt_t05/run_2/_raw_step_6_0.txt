Load at node_3, supports fixed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Structure is statically stable and closed with 5 nodes, 7 members. Stress levels are low and well distributed. Mass is under max allowed. No stress near limits to warrant area or geometry changes.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "No member stress exceeds ±30. Mass is below limit. Existing node positions for load/support fixed. Intermediate nodes (4,5) well placed to balance stresses.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Further reducing stress likely requires increased member cross-section or geometry changes. Increasing areas would increase mass beyond current 23.56, risking constraint violation. Moving intermediate nodes slightly may not yield significant stress reduction given current low stress levels. Current closed truss with 8 members is adequate.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress margin is large, so design is robust. Mass can be further reduced but that risks increasing stress. Current trade-off is optimal. No duplicate nodes or members. Areas selected from allowed set. No changes to load/support nodes.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member stresses range -6.4 to +6.0, well below ±30. Total mass 23.56 < 30. Geometry is stable. No need to increase area or reposition nodes significantly. Adding members would increase mass. Removing members risks instability or stress increase.
