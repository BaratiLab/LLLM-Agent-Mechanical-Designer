Members 3 and 4 have stress >500, far exceeding ±30 limit. Mass is low enough to allow larger cross sections or additional members. Current geometry has node_6 at (3.5,2), which may cause stress concentration. Load at node_3 (2,0) creates bending moment on members near node_4 and node_2. Need to redistribute forces, add triangulation to reduce member lengths under high stress, and increase areas selectively.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_6, add node above node_3 to create better load path. Create triangular substructures to minimize bending and reduce member stress. Increase cross section area on members near load and supports. Keep node_1 and node_2 fixed. Use areas up to 3.128 or 4.887 for high stress members. Avoid long slender members. Keep total mass under 30.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Redesign with nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2,3), node_5(4,3).

This creates two triangles (1-3-4 and 4-5-2) and diagonal bracing (3-5). Areas chosen to keep stresses low and mass moderate.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular configurations provide stable load paths and reduce bending moments. Adding node_5 at (4,3) distributes load from node_3 to node_2 via node_4 and node_5, reducing stress on members 3 and 4. Larger cross sections on critical members (1-3, 5-2) reduce stress. Smaller cross sections on diagonals maintain stability with less mass. This layout should reduce max stress below 30 and keep mass below 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and estimate stresses: Members near load have moderate length ~3-4m. Areas 0.782 to 1.759 reduce stress by factor ~4-5 compared to previous iteration. Mass roughly sum(length*area) ~ under 20, well below 30 limit.
