  "preamble": "Optimize closed 2D truss with fixed nodes and given load/support, minimize stress within ±30 and mass ≤ 30.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes fixed at node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Load -10 units at 45° down-left on node_3. Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Need closed truss with all nodes connected, minimal stress, mass ≤30. Areas discrete from given set.",
  
  "analysis": "Truss is linear on x-axis currently; to form closed truss, add at least one node above or below to create triangles for stiffness. Node_3 carries load, so members connected to it must resist load with stress ≤30. Mass depends on member lengths × area. Use minimal areas where possible to reduce mass but ensure stress limits. Triangular truss shape is optimal for stability and stress distribution. Place one additional node above node_3 to form two triangles: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_3-node_4-node_2. This creates a stable truss with 4 nodes and 5 members total (including base members).",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding node_4 above node_3 at y>0. Tentatively place at (2.0, 3.0) for reasonable height. Members: (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), (node_1-node_4), (node_4-node_2), (node_3-node_4). Calculate member lengths and estimate forces by static equilibrium. Use areas from given set to keep stresses ≤30 and mass ≤30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Assumptions: Static equilibrium in 2D, members carry axial forces only, loads are vertical components of applied force. Use simple truss method: sum forces at nodes to find member forces. Stress = force / area. Mass = sum(length × area). Use smallest area that keeps stress ≤30. Member forces estimated by decomposing load at node_3. Node_4 chosen to reduce length of diagonal members, reducing mass and stress. Select area ids accordingly.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: base members (node_1-node_3)=2.0, (node_3-node_2)=4.0. Diagonals: (node_1-node_4)=√((2-0)^2 + (3-0)^2)=√(4+9)=3.6056, (node_4-node_2)=√((6-2)^2 + (0-3)^2)=√(16+9)=5.0, (node_3-node_4)=3.0. Load at node_3 is -10 at -45°, vertical and horizontal components: Fx = -10*cos(45°) = -7.07, Fy = -10*sin(45°) = -7.07. Use method of joints at node_3 to solve member forces approximately.",
  
  "calculation": "At node_3: Forces from members (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), (node_3-node_4) balance applied load. Assume tensile positive. Let forces be F13, F32, F34.\n\nSum Fx = 0: F13 + F32 + F34*cos(θ) = Fx\nSum Fy = 0: F34*sin(θ) = Fy\n\nθ is angle of member node_3-node_4: vertical rise 3, horizontal 0 => θ=90°.
