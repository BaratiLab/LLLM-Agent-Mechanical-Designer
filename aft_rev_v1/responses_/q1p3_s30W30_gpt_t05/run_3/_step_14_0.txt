  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while maintaining constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress is 17.22 < 30, mass 14.83 < 30. Load at node_3 fixed, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_4 position varied historically between (2.0,3.0) to (2.75,3.5). Members and areas fixed. Objective: reduce max stress further.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress occurs in member_4 (17.224) and member_1 (-13.883). Member_4 connects node_2 (6,0) and node_4 (2.65,3.3). Member_1 connects node_1 (0,0) and node_3 (2,0). Member_4 stress is tensile and near max allowed. Member_4 area is 0.195, smallest area. Increasing area of member_4 may reduce stress but increases mass. Node_4 position affects geometry and force distribution. Previous trend shows increasing y of node_4 reduces stress but increases mass. Current node_4 at (2.65,3.3) is a balanced point. Slight horizontal adjustment of node_4 may reduce member_4 stress by changing angle and force path.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try moving node_4 slightly left (reduce x from 2.65 to ~2.5) and slightly up or down near 3.3 to reduce member_4 stress. Keep member areas same. Check mass impact minimal. Avoid increasing member_4 area due to mass constraint.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_4 stress is highest tensile stress. It connects node_2 and node_4. By moving node_4 closer horizontally to node_2, the member length shortens, potentially reducing stress. However, shortening member_4 too much may increase stress in other members. Need a small adjustment to balance forces. Keeping node_4 y near 3.3 maintains vertical support. Member_3 and member_5 have moderate stresses, no need to change their areas or connections. Member_1 and member_2 areas fixed at 0.782 are sufficient for compression. Load and supports fixed, so node_3 and node_1, node_2 fixed.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_4: (2.65,3.3). Try (2.5,3.25) or (2.55,3.35). Member lengths: member_4 length decreases slightly, reducing stress. Member_3 length changes slightly, stress impact minimal. Member_5 length changes slightly, stress impact minimal. Mass recalculated with same areas and approximate lengths - expect minor mass change. Max stress expected to reduce slightly below 17.22.",
  
  "calculation": "Set node_4 to (2.55, 3.25). Member_4 length: sqrt((6-2.55)^2 + (0-3.25)^2) = sqrt(3.45^2 + 3.25^2) = sqrt(11.90 + 10.56) = sqrt(22.46) ~ 4.74 (less than current ~4.53). Member_4 length slightly longer, but angle changes, possibly reducing stress. Member_3 length: sqrt((2.55-0)^2 + (3.25-0)^2) = sqrt(6.5 + 10.56) = sqrt(17.06) ~ 4.13 (close to previous). Member_5 length changes slightly. Mass approx same as before ~14.8. Expect max stress reduction from 17.22 to ~16.5.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Modification is small, keeps constraints satisfied. Max stress below 30, mass below 30. Member areas unchanged. Node_3 and support nodes fixed. No duplicate nodes or members. Structure remains closed. Continue optimization next iteration to confirm improvement or stop if no further gains.",
