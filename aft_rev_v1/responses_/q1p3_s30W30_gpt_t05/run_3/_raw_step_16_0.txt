Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_4 moved last to (2.3,3.0). Areas fixed per members. Objective: reduce max stress (currently member_4 at 19.19).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_4 has highest tensile stress at 19.19, close to 20. It connects node_2(6,0) to node_4(2.3,3.0). Member_4 length and orientation influence stress. Moving node_4 slightly could reduce stress by changing force distribution. Other members have lower stresses. Mass is well below limit, so minor area increase possible if needed. Current design stable but stress can be reduced.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing tensile stress in member_4 by adjusting node_4 position leftwards and slightly upwards to reduce axial load. Keep node_4 inside feasible region (x>2, y>2.5) to maintain truss shape and closure. Avoid increasing member lengths too much to keep mass low.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing height of node_4 slightly can reduce axial force in member_4 by changing load path. Moving node_4 closer to node_3 in x can reduce member_4 length and stress. Current x=2.3, y=3.0. Try x=2.1 to 2.2 and y=3.2 to 3.3 range. Keep other nodes fixed. Member areas remain same: member_1,2 area \'2\', member_3 area \'2\', member_4 area \'1\', member_5 area \'3\'. This balances strength and mass. Expect stress reduction in member_4 and possibly member_3.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member_4 length change: from (6,0) to (2.3,3.0) length ~4.72. Moving to (2.15,3.2) length ~4.48 (shorter). Shorter length reduces stress for same force. Member_3 length from (0,0) to (2.3,3.0) ~3.75. Moving node_4 higher increases member_3 length slightly, but stress there is low (~7.6). Mass impact minor. Overall, expect better stress distribution.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Set node_4 to (2.15, 3.25). Member lengths updated accordingly. Areas unchanged. Expected max stress reduction in member_4 from 19.19 to ~17-18 based on load path. Mass remains ~13.9, well below 30. Verify no member exceeds Â±30 stress.
