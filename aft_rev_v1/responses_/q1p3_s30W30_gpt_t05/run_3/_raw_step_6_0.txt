Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_4 moved from 3.4 to 3.0 in last step, stress increased from 16.97 to 18.57. Need to find a better vertical and horizontal position for node_4 to reduce stress further.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress concentrated in member_4 (18.57) and member_1 (-14.06). Member_4 connects node_2 and node_4, currently with area 1 (0.195). Member_1 connects node_1 and node_3, area 2 (0.782). Node_4 position affects stress distribution significantly. Lowering node_4 too much increased stress, raising node_4 too high increased mass. Horizontal position of node_4 can be adjusted slightly towards node_3 to balance forces and reduce stress in member_4 and member_1.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try node_4 around (2.3 to 2.7) horizontally and (3.0 to 3.6) vertically. Keep member areas same to keep mass low. Check if stress reduces below current 18.57.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 closer horizontally to node_3 reduces lever arm in member_4, potentially reducing stress there. Increasing vertical height slightly can reduce axial forces in members by improving geometry. Keep member_3 area at 3 (1.759) and member_4 at 1 (0.195) to keep mass low. Member_5 area at 3 (1.759) is reasonable to avoid overmass. Member_1 and member_2 areas at 2 (0.782) are consistent with previous steps.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Positions: node_4_x = 2.6, node_4_y = 3.3.
