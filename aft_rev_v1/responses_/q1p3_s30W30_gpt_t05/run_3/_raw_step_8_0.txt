Current max stress ~18.88, mass ~13.93, both within limits. Load at node_3, supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. Only node_4 movable. Areas fixed as per current design. History shows varying node_4 y-position affects stress and mass.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current max stress is on member_4 (18.88) which connects node_2 and node_4. Member_1 also has high compressive stress (-13.86). Member_3 and member_5 have moderate tension and compression. Moving node_4 slightly to reduce stress on member_4 and member_1 could help. Lowering node_4 reduces member_4 length and stress but may increase stress elsewhere. Increasing node_4 y-position previously reduced max stress but increased mass. Current design at iteration 7 is a compromise. Given constraints, slight vertical adjustment of node_4 towards ~3.2-3.3 might reduce stress on member_4 without large mass increase.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_4 stress ~18.88 at y=3.0. Previous y=3.3 had max stress ~17.35 but higher mass. Try node_4 y=3.15 to balance stress and mass. Keep areas same as iteration 7 to maintain mass control. Node_3 fixed at (2.0,0.0). Node_1 and node_2 fixed at (0,0) and (6,0).",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_4 carries highest stress, reducing its length or changing angle can reduce stress. Moving node_4 slightly upwards increases member_4 length but changes force distribution. Member_1 stress also high, adjusting node_4 x-position slightly right might reduce member_1 compression. However, node_4 x-position moves from 2.4 to 2.5 previously increased stress. Keep x=2.4, adjust y to 3.15 for moderate improvement.

Member_1 length = sqrt((2.4-0)^2 + (3.15-0)^2) = sqrt(5.76 + 9.9225) = sqrt(15.6825) ~3.96.
