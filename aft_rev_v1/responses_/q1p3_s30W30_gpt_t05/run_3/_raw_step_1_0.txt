Mass 11.65 well below 30 max. Load at node_3 (-10, -45 deg). Supports fixed. Node_4 can be moved vertically only.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_3 (node_1-node_4) has max tensile stress near limit. Moving node_4 higher increases member_3 length and stiffness, potentially redistributing stresses. Current horizontal nodes fixed. Other members have lower stresses. Mass is low, so increasing area of member_3 is possible but better to reduce stress by geometry adjustment first.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Shift node_4 from y=3.0 to about y=3.5 or 3.6 to reduce stress in member_3. Check member lengths and stresses impact. Keep cross sections same or slightly adjust area ids if needed.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing node_4 height reduces axial force in member_3 by increasing vertical component and changing force distribution. Member_5 (node_3-node_4) with largest area (3) can remain. Members 1 and 2 with area 2 are sufficient. Members 3 and 4 with area 1 can be kept or slightly adjusted if stress changes. Mass is far below max, so slight area increase possible if needed.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: m3 length = sqrt((2-0)^2 + (3.5-0)^2) = sqrt(4 + 12.25) = ~4.03 (was 3.605). Member_3 area 1, mass = length*area = 4.03*0.195=0.79 (was 0.7031). Slight increase acceptable. Anticipate member_3 stress reduction below 29. Member_4 length increases slightly, stress may reduce. Member_1 and 2 unchanged.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node_4 new y=3.55. Node_4 x=2.0 fixed. Member_3 length = ~4.21. Member_3 mass ~0.82. Total mass ~11.8.
