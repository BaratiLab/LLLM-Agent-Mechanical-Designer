  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 17.63 well below 30 limit; mass 14.64 below 30 limit; load on node_3; supports fixed; only node_4 movable.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is mostly in member_4 (17.63) and member_1 (-13.77). Member_4 connects node_2(6,0) to node_4(2.55,3.25). Adjusting node_4's vertical and horizontal position can reduce stress concentration. Lowering node_4 slightly and shifting it horizontally closer to node_3 (2,0) may balance forces better and reduce max stress. Member areas seem reasonable; no change needed now.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_4 stress is highest; move node_4 closer horizontally to node_3 to reduce lever arm effect; slight vertical adjustment to keep truss shape stable; check mass impact minimal.",
  
  "reasoning": "By moving node_4 horizontally from 2.55 to ~2.3 and lowering y from 3.25 to ~3.0, length of member_4 slightly reduces, reducing stress. This also balances tension/compression in members. Member areas kept same to maintain mass and stiffness. This move should reduce max stress without increasing mass beyond limit.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate new lengths and estimate stress reduction: member_4 length reduces, stress ~ proportional to force/area*length; shorter length reduces stress. Member_1 length changes slightly, stress may reduce. Mass change negligible as member areas unchanged.",
  
  "calculation": "New node_4 at (2.3,3.0). Length member_4 reduces from ~3.68 to ~3.35, expected stress drop ~10%. Max stress likely reduces from 17.63 to ~15.9. Mass ~14.5, below 30 constraint. No member area changes.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 move feasible, reduces max stress, mass under limits, no constraint violations, truss remains closed and connected, no duplicate nodes/members.",
