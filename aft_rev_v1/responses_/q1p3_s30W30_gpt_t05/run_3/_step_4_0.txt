  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress currently 16.17 < 30; total mass 15.68 < 30. Load at node_3 fixed, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_4 moved from (2.0,3.8) to (2.8,3.6) in last iteration, which reduced stress and mass. Areas mostly small except member_5 (area 3).",
  
  "analysis": "Member_4 has highest stress 16.17, member_1 compressive stress -13.73 is also significant. Member_3 and member_5 have moderate stresses. Current node_4 position (2.8,3.6) seems to balance forces better than previous. Further small adjustments to node_4 position can reduce stress concentrations. Member areas are small to moderate, so adjusting geometry is primary lever now.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try lowering node_4 slightly and shifting horizontally to balance tension/compression better. Aim to reduce member_4 stress below 16.17. Keep node_4 inside triangle formed by node_1, node_2, node_3 to maintain closed truss. Check if shifting node_4 closer to node_3 reduces stress on member_4 and member_1.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_4 connects node_2 (roller) to node_4, carrying highest stress. Reducing vertical height of node_4 reduces lever arm, potentially lowering force in member_4. Shifting node_4 horizontally closer to node_3 may redistribute load more evenly among members. Keep member areas same to isolate effect of geometry change. Use precise floats to adjust node_4 within range x=[2.5,3.0], y=[3.2,3.6].",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_4: (2.8,3.6). Try (2.65,3.4) and (2.7,3.3) to check stress trend. Calculate member lengths and estimate stress proportionality to length and angle. Member_4 length reduces from ~3.6 to ~3.2, expect stress drop. Member_3 and member_5 length change minor, stress should balance out.",
  
  "calculation": "At node_4=(2.65,3.4): member_4 length ~ sqrt((6-2.65)^2 + (0-3.4)^2) = sqrt(11.22 + 11.56) = sqrt(22.78) ~4.77 (recalculation needed as previous length estimates off). Previous length ~ sqrt((6-2.8)^2 + (0-3.6)^2) = sqrt(10.24 + 12.96) = sqrt(23.2) ~4.82. Slight reduction in length, small stress decrease expected. Member_1 length from node_1 to node_4 reduces slightly from sqrt(2.8^2 + 3.6^2)=4.56 to sqrt(2.65^2 + 3.4^2)=4.31, which reduces stress in member_1. Overall expect max stress to reduce below 16.17.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Adjust node_4 to (2.65, 3.4), keep other nodes fixed. Maintain areas as before. Expect reduced max stress and total mass within limits. Continue optimization next iteration if stress still not minimal.",
