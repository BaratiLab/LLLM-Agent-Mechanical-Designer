  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position and member areas to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 17.55 well below 30; mass 20.0 below 30. Node_4 raised to 3.8 improved stress from 27.75 to 17.55 but mass increased. Member_3 area increased to 3 increased mass but reduced stress drastically. Load at node_3 and supports fixed.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_4 has highest tensile stress 17.55, member_1 highest compressive stress -12.215. Member_3 stress low at 3.0285 but high mass (7.5535). Member_5 and member_2 have low stress and moderate mass. Node_4 moved up to reduce stress in member_3 and member_4. Current design is stable with no constraints violated. Further stress reduction possible by adjusting node_4 vertically or horizontally slightly and fine tuning member areas, especially reducing member_3 area to reduce mass if stress permits.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing member_4 stress from 17.55 closer to member_1 stress ~12, possibly by moving node_4 horizontally towards node_2 to reduce tension in member_4. Also consider reducing member_3 area from 3 to 2 or 1 if stress allows to reduce mass. Member_1 and member_2 areas fixed at 2 seem acceptable. Keep node_3 fixed at (2.0,0.0).",
  
  "reasoning": "Member stresses depend on geometry and cross-sectional area. Moving node_4 horizontally closer to node_2 reduces length and tension in member_4, reducing stress. Slight vertical adjustment can balance stresses among members 3,4,5. Reducing member_3 area reduces mass but must keep stress below 30. Member_1 and member_2 areas at 2 are minimal for their stress levels. Member_5 area at 3 is adequate given low stress. Aim to balance stresses in members 3 and 4 to reduce max stress. Total mass must remain below 30.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current areas: member_1=2, member_2=2, member_3=3, member_4=1, member_5=3. Member_3 area 3 contributes 7.5535 mass, member_5 area 3 contributes 6.6842 mass. Total mass 20.0055. Reducing member_3 area from 3 to 2 reduces mass by roughly (7.5535 - 5.0) ~2.5 units but stress may increase. Moving node_4 horizontally from x=2.0 to ~3.0 reduces member_4 length and stress. Vertical position can be optimized around 3.5-3.8.",
  
  "calculation": "Proposed new node_4 position: (2.8, 3.6). This shifts node_4 closer to node_2 (6,0), reducing member_4 length and stress. Member_3 area reduced from 3 to 2 to reduce mass. Member_4 area kept 1. Member_1, member_2 areas kept 2. Member_5 area kept 3 for stability. Estimated mass: member_3 mass ~5.0, member_4 mass ~1.0759, total mass reduces slightly from 20.0 to ~17.5. Estimated max stress reduces from 17.55 to ~15 due to geometry improvement. This keeps all constraints satisfied.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved to (2.8, 3.6). Member_3 area reduced to 2. Member_4 area 1 unchanged. Member_1 and member_2 areas 2 unchanged. Member_5 area 3 unchanged. Load and support nodes fixed. Structure remains closed. No duplicate nodes or members. Estimated max stress < 20 and total mass < 30. Continuing optimization possible but diminishing returns expected.",
