Member_4 has smallest area (1), likely causing higher stress. Members_1 and 2 have area 2, member_5 area 3. Node_4 moved from 3.0 to 3.15 in y, stress slightly decreased but mass increased. Current layout is stable but stress can be lowered by repositioning node_4 to better distribute load and adjusting member areas if possible.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_4 area is smallest, increasing area may reduce stress but increases mass. Node_4 position affects force distribution. Consider slightly shifting node_4 horizontally and vertically to balance stresses, possibly lowering member_4 stress. Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed as per constraints.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "To reduce max stress, redistribute forces by adjusting node_4 position. Moving node_4 slightly closer to node_2 horizontally may reduce tension in member_4. Also, a slight vertical adjustment might balance compressive and tensile forces. Keep member areas same for mass control. Use precise float values for node_4 position. Avoid increasing member_4 area to keep mass low. Evaluate stress decrease vs mass increase tradeoff.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_4 at (2.4,3.15).
