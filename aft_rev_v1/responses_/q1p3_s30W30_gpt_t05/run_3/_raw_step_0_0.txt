Node positions fixed; can only add members between given nodes. Need minimal mass and stress within limits.",\n\n  "analysis": "The truss is linear in x-axis but must be closed, so at least one additional node off-axis is needed to form a triangle or polygon. Adding a node above or below to create a triangular truss is optimal for stability and load distribution. Node_3 is loaded downward-left, so placing a node above node_3 to form a triangle with node_1 and node_2 is logical. This creates a stable triangular shape that resists bending and distributes forces efficiently.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) above node_3 to form triangle (node_1, node_2, node_4). Connect members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_4. This creates closed polygon with 5 members. Calculate member lengths, assign areas to keep stress ±30 and mass ≤30. Use truss method and static equilibrium to estimate forces and stress.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Triangular truss is most material efficient for 2D structures. Adding node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) creates a triangle with base 6m and height 3m, giving members lengths ~3.0 to 6.7m. Members connected to node_3 distribute load.

Assign areas to members with higher forces larger areas. Estimate forces from load vector (-10N at -45°): Fx = -7.07N, Fy = -7.07N at node_3. Use equilibrium to find member forces approximately.
