  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while keeping mass under 30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 17.94 well below Â±30. Total mass 14.3 < 30. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_4 moved in past iterations between y=3.0 to 3.8 and x=2.0 to 2.8. Best stress ~16.17 at iteration_3 at (2.8,3.6). Current at (2.6,3.1) stress 17.94. Areas fixed as per current members.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is mainly on member_4 (17.94) and member_1 (~14.1). Member_4 has smallest area (1) and highest stress. Member_1 and member_2 have area 2. Member_5 has largest area 3. Node_4 position affects stress distribution significantly. Moving node_4 slightly upward and right may reduce max stress. Member lengths and areas keep mass within limit.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try moving node_4 closer to iteration_3 position (2.8,3.6) where stress was lower. Keep areas same. Check if stress reduces without increasing mass beyond 30. Avoid moving node_3, node_1, node_2. Current mass 14.3 is low, room to increase member areas if needed.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_4 stress is highest, increasing area might reduce stress but mass increases. Better to reduce stress by geometric repositioning. Node_4 at (2.8,3.6) gave stress ~16.17 previously. Current is (2.6,3.1) with 17.94 stress. Slight move towards (2.75,3.5) may reduce stress further. Keep member areas as is to keep mass low. Member_3 area 2 is moderate, member_5 area 3 is largest. Member_5 stress low (~4).",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: member_4 length sqrt((6-2.6)^2 + (0-3.1)^2) ~4.53. Member_1 length sqrt((2-0)^2 + (0-0)^2)=2.0. Mass = sum(length*area_factor). Areas: '0':1, '1':0.195, '2':0.782, '3':1.759. Current: member_4 area_id='1' (0.195), member_1 area_id='2'(0.782).",
  
  "calculation": "Move node_4 to (2.75, 3.5). New member_4 length ~ sqrt((6-2.75)^2 + (0-3.5)^2) = sqrt(3.25^2 + 3.5^2) = sqrt(10.56 + 12.25) = sqrt(22.81) ~4.78. Mass member_4 = 4.78*0.195=0.932 (slight increase). Member_1 length unchanged 2.0, mass = 2*0.782=1.564. Total mass ~14.5 (est). Expected stress on member_4 reduces due to better force distribution, member_1 stress stable or slightly reduced.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 move to (2.75,3.5) expected to reduce max stress below current 17.94, keep mass below 15. No area changes to avoid mass increase. Stop only if stress cannot be reduced further or minimal improvement possible.",
