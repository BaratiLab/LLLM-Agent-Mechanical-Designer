  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 17.86 < 30, mass 14.8857 < 30; nodes fixed at supports and loads; node_4 moved slightly over iterations to minimize stress.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress concentrated in member_4 (17.86) and member_1 (-13.12). Members have areas 1, 2, 3 corresponding to 0.195, 0.782, 1.759 area factors. Mass is well below limit, so slight area increase possible if needed. Node_4 position influences stress distribution. Current node_4 is at (2.3, 3.4).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_4 stress is highest tensile, member_1 highest compressive. Member_4 connects node_2 (roller) to node_4 (free to move). Increasing height of node_4 might reduce member_4 stress by changing force angles. Member_5 (node_3-node_4) area is largest (3), possibly to carry shear. Member_3 and member_1 have area 2 (0.782) and 2 respectively. Current design is stable, but stress can be reduced by small node_4 position adjustment.",
  
  "reasoning": "To reduce stress in member_4 (highest), increase vertical component of force by raising node_4 slightly to reduce axial load. Also, slightly shifting node_4 in x to balance forces may help. Since node_3 is fixed at (2,0) and node_2 at (6,0), node_4 can move horizontally between 2 and 3 to optimize geometry. Member areas are fixed; no instruction to change areas now, so keep same areas. Mass is low enough to allow small geometry change.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: m4 length = sqrt((6-2.3)^2 + (0-3.4)^2) ~ sqrt(3.7^2 + 3.4^2) ~ 5.03. Increasing y of node_4 to 3.6 and shifting x to 2.5 may reduce stress in m4. Check if mass stays under limit. Member areas unchanged: m1=2, m2=2, m3=2, m4=1, m5=3.",
  
  "calculation": "Propose node_4 at (2.5, 3.6). Length m4 = sqrt((6-2.5)^2 + (0-3.6)^2) = sqrt(3.5^2 + 3.6^2) = sqrt(12.25 + 12.96) = sqrt(25.21) ~ 5.02. Mass m4 = length * area factor = 5.02 * 0.195 = 0.979 (similar to current). Other members lengths change slightly but mass remains similar. Max stress expected to reduce due to better force distribution. Member areas unchanged.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved to (2.5, 3.6) to reduce max stress in member_4. Areas unchanged, mass remains under 30. Max stress expected below current 17.86. Stop not yet recommended, further iterations possible if needed.",
