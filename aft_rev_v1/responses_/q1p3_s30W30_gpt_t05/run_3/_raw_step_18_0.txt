Members have areas 1, 2, 3 corresponding to 0.195, 0.782, 1.759 area factors. Mass is well below limit, so slight area increase possible if needed. Node_4 position influences stress distribution. Current node_4 is at (2.3, 3.4).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_4 stress is highest tensile, member_1 highest compressive. Member_4 connects node_2 (roller) to node_4 (free to move). Increasing height of node_4 might reduce member_4 stress by changing force angles. Member_5 (node_3-node_4) area is largest (3), possibly to carry shear. Member_3 and member_1 have area 2 (0.782) and 2 respectively. Current design is stable, but stress can be reduced by small node_4 position adjustment.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "To reduce stress in member_4 (highest), increase vertical component of force by raising node_4 slightly to reduce axial load. Also, slightly shifting node_4 in x to balance forces may help. Since node_3 is fixed at (2,0) and node_2 at (6,0), node_4 can move horizontally between 2 and 3 to optimize geometry. Member areas are fixed; no instruction to change areas now, so keep same areas. Mass is low enough to allow small geometry change.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: m4 length = sqrt((6-2.3)^2 + (0-3.4)^2) ~ sqrt(3.7^2 + 3.4^2) ~ 5.03.
