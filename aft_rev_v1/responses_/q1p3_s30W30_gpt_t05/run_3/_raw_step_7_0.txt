Load at node_3 fixed; supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_4 moved in previous iterations to balance stress and mass. Members areas fixed as per iteration 6.",\n  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_4 (17.355) and member_1 (-13.7918). Member_4 is tensile, member_1 compressive. Member_5 stress low (-4.0858). Mass is moderate at 14.8. Node_4 at (2.6, 3.3) is slightly forward and elevated. Previous iterations show that increasing node_4 y reduced stress but increased mass; lowering y reduced mass but increased stress. Moving node_4 slightly left and down may reduce tensile stress on member_4 while keeping compressive stress on member_1 moderate.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try node_4 at (2.4, 3.0) to reduce member_4 length/stress, maintain closed truss shape. Keep member areas same for now, as area changes may increase mass. Member_3 area=2, member_4 area=1, member_5 area=3 are reasonable. Evaluate if stress reduces below 17.35 and mass remains below 30.",\n  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 closer to node_3 horizontally will reduce length and force on member_4, reducing max tensile stress. Lowering node_4 vertically reduces overall member lengths and therefore mass and stress. Keeping node_4 inside the triangle formed by nodes 1,2,3 maintains closed shape. Member areas remain same to avoid mass increase. Stress reduction on critical member_4 is key to minimize max stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate approximate length changes: member_4 length at (2.6,3.3) is ~sqrt((6-2.6)^2 + 3.3^2)=~4.54; at (2.4,3.0) is sqrt((6-2.4)^2 + 3^2)=sqrt(3.6^2+3^2)=4.68 slightly longer but more vertical alignment may reduce stress. Member_3 length at (2.6,3.3) is sqrt((2.6)^2 + 3.3^2)=4.21; at (2.4,3.0) is 3.78 shorter, reduces mass/stress. Member_5 length changes slightly. Overall, expect slight reduction in max stress.",\n  "calculation": "Set node_4 to (2.4, 3.0). Keep nodes 1,2,3 fixed. Member areas unchanged.
