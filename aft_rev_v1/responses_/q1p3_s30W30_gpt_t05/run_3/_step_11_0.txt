  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress is 17.36 < 30, mass 14.62 < 30, load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved progressively in history to balance stress.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_4 (17.36) tensile, member_1 compression near -14.1. Member areas fixed. Node_4 controls geometry of upper triangle. Moving node_4 slightly affects force distribution. Current node_4 at (2.7,3.2) yields good stress but can try small adjustments to reduce max stress further.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_4 tensile stress is highest; reducing length or changing angle may reduce stress. Node_4 movement limited to vertical and horizontal shifts. Avoid increasing mass by large member length changes. Areas fixed for members; no area optimization now.",
  
  "reasoning": "Shift node_4 slightly left and down to reduce tensile force in member_4 by decreasing its length and changing force angle. Keep node_4 above node_3 to maintain closed truss. Small horizontal shift left and vertical shift down expected to reduce max stress. Member lengths and geometry changes minor to avoid mass increase.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_4: (2.7, 3.2). Try node_4: (2.55, 3.0) as in iteration_9, max stress was 18.25 higher. Try intermediate: (2.6, 3.1). Check member lengths and expected stress impact. Member_4 length approx sqrt((6-2.6)^2 + (0-3.1)^2) ~ sqrt(11.56+9.61)= sqrt(21.17)=4.6 vs current ~4.5. Slightly longer but angle changes may reduce stress. Member_3 length sqrt((2.6-0)^2+ (3.1-0)^2)= sqrt(6.76+9.61)= sqrt(16.37)=4.05 vs current 5.98. Shorter member_3 reduces stress there.",
  
  "calculation": "Set node_4 = (2.6, 3.1). Members and areas unchanged. Expect reduction in max stress due to better load path. Mass likely stable or slightly reduced. Constraints remain satisfied.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no load/support nodes moved. No duplicate nodes or members. Areas valid. Mass under 30, max stress under 30. Optimization step reasonable.",
