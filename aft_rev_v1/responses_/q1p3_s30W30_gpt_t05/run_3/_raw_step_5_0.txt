Members 2, 3, 5 have lower stresses. Mass is moderate. Node_4 position affects stress distribution significantly. Current member areas are reasonable. Further reducing node_4 height and shifting it slightly left might reduce member_4 stress by reducing its axial force.

Slight left shift balances forces in members 3 and 5. Member areas kept same to avoid mass increase and maintain stress limits. No new members added to keep structure simple and closed.
