  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress below 27.75 while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 27.75 < 30, mass 12.77 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved up from 3.0 to 3.55 to reduce stress from 29.05 to 27.75. Member_3 stress highest at 27.75, tensile.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_3 (node_1-node_4) has highest tensile stress near limit. Increasing height of node_4 reduces stress in member_3 but increases mass. Node_3 fixed due to load. Members 1 and 2 under compression, low stress. Member 5 under compression with low stress. Member 4 tensile but moderate stress. Further increasing node_4 height may reduce stress further but mass increases. Need to balance height to reduce max stress below current 27.75 without exceeding mass limit 30.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider small vertical increase of node_4 from 3.55 to ~3.8-4.0 to reduce member_3 tensile stress. Check impact on member lengths and masses. Possibly slightly adjust member areas if allowed, but current instructions do not allow area changes except by changing area_id in member_dict. Current areas are 2 for members 1,2; 1 for members 3,4; 3 for member 5. Areas seem reasonable for load distribution.",
  
  "reasoning": "Increasing node_4 height increases length of members 3,4,5. This may reduce stress in member_3 by increasing its length and changing force distribution. Member 5 length increase will increase mass but allowed up to 30. Member stress is proportional to force/area, so increasing area_id for member_3 from 1 (0.195) to 2 (0.782) or 3 (1.759) could reduce stress, but instructions do not mention area change except from given sets. Current member_3 area is 1 (0.195). Increasing area_id for member_3 to 2 or 3 could reduce stress significantly. But since mass is low (12.77), increasing area is feasible within mass constraint. So increasing area_id for member_3 from 1 to 3 is a good approach along with increasing node_4 height slightly.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: member_3 length = distance(node_1, node_4). Current node_4 at y=3.55. Length ~ sqrt((2-0)^2 + (3.55-0)^2) = sqrt(4 + 12.6) = sqrt(16.6) = 4.07. Increasing y to 3.8 length = sqrt(4 + 14.44) = sqrt(18.44) = 4.29. Area change from 0.195 to 1.759 increases cross section by ~9x, reducing stress by ~9x if force constant. Mass increase = length * (area difference). Current member_3 mass = 0.7946, increasing area from 0.195 to 1.759 (9x) increases mass to ~7.15, total mass ~19.1 still < 30. So feasible.",
  
  "calculation": "Set node_4 y = 3.8. Update member_3 area_id from '1' to '3'. Keep other areas same. Node positions: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (2,3.8). Members: member_1 (node_1-node_3, area 2), member_2 (node_2-node_3, area 2), member_3 (node_1-node_4, area 3), member_4 (node_2-node_4, area 1), member_5 (node_3-node_4, area 3). This reduces member_3 stress significantly, likely below 15, max stress now likely member_4 or member_1. Mass increases but stays below 30.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met: max stress < 30, mass < 30, load/support nodes fixed, no duplicate nodes or members, areas from allowed set. Node_4 moved to 3.8 to reduce stress. Member_3 area increased to reduce stress. Structure remains closed. Optimization can continue if needed but this is a significant improvement.",
