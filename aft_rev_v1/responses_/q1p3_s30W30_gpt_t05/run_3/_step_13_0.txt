  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while satisfying constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress currently 16.49 < 30, total mass 15.4 < 30. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Areas fixed per member. Node_4 movable. Objective: reduce max stress further.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_4 (16.49), tensile, and member_1 compressive (-13.78). Member areas are fixed. Node_4 at (2.75,3.5) moved up from previous iterations. Increasing height tends to reduce compressive stress in bottom chords but can increase tensile stress in top chords. Member_4 area is smallest (1), possibly limiting stress capacity. Member_5 area is largest (3), under low stress (-4.11).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider slightly lowering node_4 y-coordinate to reduce tensile stress in member_4. Slightly adjust x-coordinate to balance forces. Member areas fixed, so geometry is main lever. Current mass is moderate, so small geometry tweaks can reduce stresses without increasing mass.",
  
  "reasoning": "Lowering node_4 y from 3.5 to ~3.3-3.4 may reduce tensile stress in member_4 and compressive in member_1 by changing force distribution. Adjust x of node_4 slightly towards node_3 (from 2.75 to ~2.6) to reduce lever arm and bending moment. This can reduce max stress. Keep all connections same for closed truss. Areas remain unchanged as they are near optimal for mass and stress tradeoff. Load and support nodes fixed.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: member_4 length = distance(node_2(6,0), node_4), member_1 length = distance(node_1(0,0), node_4). Reducing height reduces member_4 length and force. Slight x shift reduces moment. Check mass: member mass proportional to length*area. Small length reduction reduces mass slightly, stress likely reduced.",
  
  "calculation": "Set node_4 to (2.65, 3.3). Length member_4: sqrt((6-2.65)^2 + (0-3.3)^2) ~ sqrt(11.22 + 10.89)= sqrt(22.11)=4.7m approx, down from ~4.8m. Member_1 length: sqrt((2.65)^2 + (3.3)^2)= sqrt(7.02+10.89)=sqrt(17.91)=4.23m approx, down from ~4.35m. Mass reduces slightly. Expected stress reduction from smaller lever arm and member length. Member areas unchanged: member_1: 2(0.782), member_4: 1(0.195), member_5: 3(1.759). Expected max stress < current 16.49. Total mass < 15.4. Constraints met.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved to (2.65,3.3) to reduce max stress on member_4 and member_1, maintain closed truss, areas unchanged. Load and supports fixed. Mass and stress constraints satisfied. Further large improvements unlikely without changing member areas or adding nodes. Continue optimization if desired.",
