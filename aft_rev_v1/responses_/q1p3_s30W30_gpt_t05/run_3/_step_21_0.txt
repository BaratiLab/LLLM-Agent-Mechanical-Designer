  "preamble": "Current 4-node truss with 5 members meets constraints; stress minimized within limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: minimize max stress ≤ ±30 and total mass ≤ 30. Current max stress 14.63 is well below limit; mass 18.1 below max 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Only node_4 movable. Member areas chosen from given discrete set.",
  "analysis": "Current design has relatively low max stress and mass within constraints. Node_4 moved upward and slightly right to balance stresses. Member areas are mostly small to medium (area ids 1,2,3). Max stress member_1 is compressive near -14.6, member_3 tensile 8.2. Member_4 stress reduced to 3.9 with area increased to 2, improving stress distribution. Further node_4 movement risks increasing mass or stress. No duplicate members or nodes. Load and supports fixed.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further optimization by moving node_4 or changing areas likely yields marginal gains but risks increased mass or stress. Current stress distribution is balanced, no member near stress limits. Mass is moderate. Design appears near optimal given constraints.",
  "reasoning": "Minimizing stress involves balancing geometry to distribute forces evenly. Node_4 position at (3.15,3.4) improves force paths, reducing max stress to 14.63. Member areas chosen to support load without excess mass. Increasing area of member_4 reduced its stress significantly. The structure remains stable and closed. Moving node_4 further or changing member areas risks violating mass or stress constraints or destabilizing structure.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress limits ±30, mass ≤30. Current max stress 14.63 << 30, mass 18.1 << 30. Member lengths and areas yield mass and stress within limits. Node_4 moved from (2.65,3.4) to (3.15,3.4) to reduce stress. Areas: member_1 and member_2 area_id=2, member_3=2, member_4=2, member_5=3. No violations. Load at node_3 fixed; supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed.",
  "calculation": "Member lengths: m1: dist(node_1-node_3)=2.0, m2: dist(node_2-node_3)=4.0, m3: dist(node_1-node_4)=~3.9, m4: dist(node_2-node_4)=~3.3, m5: dist(node_3-node_4)=~3.6. Mass = sum(length × area factor). Using areas from iteration 20: m1,m2,m3,m4 areas=2(0.782), m5=3(1.759). Mass ~18.1. Max stress 14.63 < 30. No constraint violation.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Design stable, constraints met, max stress minimized to 14.63. Further changes unlikely to improve significantly without increasing mass or stress. Stop optimization.",
