  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while maintaining constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 18.25 < 30, total mass 14.15 < 30. Load at node_3 fixed, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_4 moved slightly in past iterations to reduce stress. Member areas fixed as per last iteration.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress mainly in member_4 (18.25) and member_1 (-14.08). Member_4 connects node_2 (6.0,0.0) to node_4 (2.55,3.05). To reduce stress in member_4, adjust node_4 position to reduce force demand. Member_3 and member_5 stresses are moderate. Node_4 can be moved within reasonable vertical and horizontal limits without breaking constraints or changing load/support nodes. Member areas are already moderate, no changes allowed per instructions.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Shifting node_4 slightly left and up may reduce stress in member_4 and member_1 by improving force distribution. Avoid large vertical moves to keep mass low. Horizontal move towards node_3 may reduce lever arm and stress in member_4.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_4 stress is tensile and close to max. Moving node_4 closer to node_2 horizontally reduces length and stress in member_4. But node_4 must remain above base to keep truss shape. Moving node_4 closer to node_3 horizontally and slightly higher may balance stresses better. Member_1 compressive stress is high, so moving node_4 right or down should be avoided. Aim for node_4 around (2.7, 3.2) to balance forces. This should maintain total mass under 30 and max stress below 30.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_4 at (2.55, 3.05). Try (2.7, 3.2): length member_4 ~ sqrt((6-2.7)^2 + (0-3.2)^2)=sqrt(3.3^2 + 3.2^2)=~4.6, slightly longer but better force angle. Member_1 length ~ sqrt((2.7-0)^2 + (3.2-0)^2)=~4.3 vs current ~3.9. Stress may reduce due to improved geometry. Member_5 length changes slightly but minor effect.",
  
  "calculation": "Update node_4 to (2.7, 3.2). Keep other nodes fixed. Member connections unchanged. Areas unchanged: member_1 area_id=2, member_2=2, member_3=2, member_4=1, member_5=3. Expect slight reduction in max stress due to better force distribution. Total mass expected around current 14.15, within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Check no duplicate nodes or members, supports and loads fixed, areas valid. Constraints likely met with improved stress distribution. Continue optimization if stress not reduced enough in next iteration.",
