Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_4 moved recently to (2.15, 3.25).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_4 (18.74) tensile, which connects node_2(6,0) to node_4(2.15,3.25). To reduce stress, we can try repositioning node_4 to change member lengths and force distribution. Member areas are fixed as per last iteration. Node_4 vertical position affects force paths and stress magnitudes.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing node_4 height tends to reduce max stress but increases mass; lowering reduces mass but increases stress. Current mass is moderate. Need to find balance by fine-tuning node_4 position.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Since node_1, node_2, node_3 are fixed, only node_4 can be moved. Member_4 area is smallest (area_id \'1\' = 0.195), so stress reduction by geometry is critical. Slightly increasing node_4 x from 2.15 to ~2.3 and y from 3.25 to ~3.4 may reduce tensile stress in member_4 by redistributing load. Member_3 and member_5 areas are larger, so stress there is less critical. Member_1 and member_2 areas moderate. Avoid increasing node_4 height too much to keep mass low.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Try node_4 at (2.3, 3.4). Estimate member lengths and expect improved force distribution. Member lengths: member_4 length ~ sqrt((6-2.3)^2 + (0-3.4)^2) = sqrt(13.69 + 11.56) ~ sqrt(25.25) ~5.02. Slightly longer than current 4.04. Slight increase in member_4 length but may reduce stress due to geometry. Member_3 length ~ sqrt((2.3-0)^2 + (3.4-0)^2) = sqrt(5.29 + 11.56) = sqrt(16.85) ~4.1. Member_5 length ~ sqrt((2-2.3)^2 + (0-3.4)^2) = sqrt(0.09 + 11.56) = sqrt(11.65) ~3.41. Member_1 and 2 unchanged.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Adjust node_4 to (2.3, 3.4).
