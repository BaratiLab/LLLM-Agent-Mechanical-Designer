  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while maintaining constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress currently 16.97 < 30 limit, total mass 15.08 < 30 limit. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_4 moved downward and left from previous iteration, stress slightly increased on member_4.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_4 near max stress (16.97), member_1 high compressive stress (-13.74). Members 2, 3, 5 have lower stresses. Mass is moderate. Node_4 position affects stress distribution significantly. Current member areas are reasonable. Further reducing node_4 height and shifting it slightly left might reduce member_4 stress by reducing its axial force. Node_3 fixed at (2.0,0.0), node_1 and node_2 fixed supports.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try node_4 at approx (2.5, 3.0) to reduce vertical member_4 stress and keep truss stable. Keep member areas same to maintain mass and stiffness balance.",
  
  "reasoning": "Lowering node_4 reduces member_4 length and axial force, reducing its stress. Slight left shift balances forces in members 3 and 5. Member areas kept same to avoid mass increase and maintain stress limits. No new members added to keep structure simple and closed. Node_3, node_1, node_2 fixed as per constraints. This adjustment expected to reduce max stress below current 16.97.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and estimate stress effect: member_4 length reduces from ~3.74 to ~3.35, stress proportional to force/area and length. Expected stress drop on member_4. Member_3 and 5 forces should remain balanced. Mass slightly reduced due to shorter member_4 length.",
  
  "calculation": "New node_4: (2.5, 3.0). Member lengths: m3 ~ sqrt((2.5-0)^2 + (3.0-0)^2) = 3.905, m4 ~ sqrt((6.0-2.5)^2 + (0-3.0)^2) = 4.03, m5 ~ sqrt((2.0-2.5)^2 + (0-3.0)^2) = 3.04. Member areas unchanged: m1=2, m2=2, m3=2, m4=1, m5=3. Estimated mass ~ sum(length*area factor). Mass ~ (m1 2.0*0.782)+(m2 4.0*0.782)+(m3 3.905*0.782)+(m4 4.03*0.195)+(m5 3.04*1.759) = approx 1.564 + 3.128 + 3.053 + 0.786 + 5.35 = 13.88 < 15.08 previous, stress expected max < 16.97.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved lower and left to reduce member_4 stress and overall max stress. Mass reduced. Constraints satisfied. Stop condition not yet met as small improvements possible.",
