  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective is to minimize max stress <=30 and total_mass <=30. Current max stress ~18.88, mass ~13.93, both within limits. Load at node_3, supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. Only node_4 movable. Areas fixed as per current design. History shows varying node_4 y-position affects stress and mass.",
  
  "analysis": "Current max stress is on member_4 (18.88) which connects node_2 and node_4. Member_1 also has high compressive stress (-13.86). Member_3 and member_5 have moderate tension and compression. Moving node_4 slightly to reduce stress on member_4 and member_1 could help. Lowering node_4 reduces member_4 length and stress but may increase stress elsewhere. Increasing node_4 y-position previously reduced max stress but increased mass. Current design at iteration 7 is a compromise. Given constraints, slight vertical adjustment of node_4 towards ~3.2-3.3 might reduce stress on member_4 without large mass increase.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_4 stress ~18.88 at y=3.0. Previous y=3.3 had max stress ~17.35 but higher mass. Try node_4 y=3.15 to balance stress and mass. Keep areas same as iteration 7 to maintain mass control. Node_3 fixed at (2.0,0.0). Node_1 and node_2 fixed at (0,0) and (6,0).",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_4 carries highest stress, reducing its length or changing angle can reduce stress. Moving node_4 slightly upwards increases member_4 length but changes force distribution. Member_1 stress also high, adjusting node_4 x-position slightly right might reduce member_1 compression. However, node_4 x-position moves from 2.4 to 2.5 previously increased stress. Keep x=2.4, adjust y to 3.15 for moderate improvement. Areas kept as {'member_1':2, 'member_2':2, 'member_3':2, 'member_4':1, 'member_5':3} consistent with iteration 7 for feasibility.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths for node_4 at (2.4, 3.15): member_4 length = sqrt((6-2.4)^2 + (0-3.15)^2) = sqrt(3.6^2 + 3.15^2) = sqrt(12.96 + 9.9225) = sqrt(22.8825) ~4.784. Member_1 length = sqrt((2.4-0)^2 + (3.15-0)^2) = sqrt(5.76 + 9.9225) = sqrt(15.6825) ~3.96. Mass estimate: sum(length*area) with areas 2=0.782, 1=0.195, 3=1.759. member_1:3.96*0.782=3.096, member_2: length ~4.472*0.782=3.5, member_3:3.96*0.782=3.096, member_4:4.784*0.195=0.933, member_5: length between node_3(2,0) and node_4(2.4,3.15) = sqrt(0.4^2 +3.15^2)=3.18*1.759=5.6. Total mass ~15.3 <30, acceptable.",
  
  "calculation": "Adjust node_4 to (2.4, 3.15). Keep members and areas same as iteration 7. Expect slight reduction in max stress from 18.88 to ~17.0-17.5 based on trend. Total mass increases slightly but remains below 30. This adjustment balances stress and mass within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes or members. Node_4 moved only. Load/support nodes fixed. Areas valid. Constraints satisfied: max stress <30, mass <30. Optimization can continue further if needed.",
