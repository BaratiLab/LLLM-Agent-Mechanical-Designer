  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 16.86 well below Â±30; mass 15.49 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Objective: reduce max stress further by adjusting node_4 (only movable node).",
  
  "analysis": "Member_4 has highest stress (16.8583) close to max stress; it connects node_2 (fixed) to node_4 (movable). Members with lower stress can be maintained. Adjusting node_4 position can redistribute forces to lower max stress. Increasing height tends to decrease compressive stress in bottom members but may increase tension in others. Current node_4 at (2.5,3.6).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try slightly shifting node_4 horizontally and vertically to reduce stress in member_4 without increasing others beyond limits. Member areas are fixed; member_4 area is '1' (0.195), smallest; consider increasing area for member_4 if needed but instructions say only node movement allowed.",
  
  "reasoning": "Since area change not allowed, only node movement. Moving node_4 slightly right closer to node_2 may reduce member_4 length and stress. Also, a small vertical adjustment could balance forces. Avoid lowering height too much to not increase bottom member stresses. Horizontal shift from 2.5 to ~3.0 and height from 3.6 to ~3.3 might reduce member_4 stress.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and forces depend on node_4 position. Member_4 length = distance(node_2,node_4). Reducing length reduces force for fixed area. Also, changing angles affects force distribution. Keep node_4 within reasonable bounds to maintain closed shape.",
  
  "calculation": "Propose node_4 at (3.05, 3.3). This reduces member_4 length from ~3.6 to ~3.3, potentially lowering stress. Check that other member lengths remain feasible and stress under limits. Member_3 and member_5 lengths remain similar, preserving their stress levels. Estimate total mass remains under 30. Max stress expected to reduce below current 16.86.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New node_4 (3.05, 3.3) with existing member connections and areas should reduce max stress, maintain constraints. No duplicate nodes or members introduced. Load/support nodes unchanged.",
