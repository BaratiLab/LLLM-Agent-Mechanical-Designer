Load at node_3, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Node_4 movable, members use areas {1,2,3}.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress dominated by member_4 (16.21), others lower. Member_4 has smallest area (0.195) and relatively short length. Increasing area there reduces stress but adds mass. Node_4 position affects geometry and force distribution. Current design has mass ~15.16, stress ~16.21. Load on node_3 pulls diagonally down-left. Member_1 in compression (-14.61), member_4 in tension (16.21).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress, consider adjusting node_4 position to reduce load on member_4 and member_1. Moving node_4 slightly right and/or up may redistribute forces. Also consider increasing area of member_4 from \'1\' (0.195) to \'2\' (0.782) or \'3\' (1.759) to reduce stress. Member areas are discrete, so area changes must be from available set.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_4 has highest tensile stress; increasing its area reduces stress. Node_4 position can be tuned to optimize load paths. Member_1 compressive stress is high but less than member_4 tensile. Member_5 area is largest (3), stress low (-4.2), so can be left as is. Member_3 area is 2 (0.782), stress moderate. Member_2 area 2 (0.782), stress low. Increasing member_4 area to \'2\' or \'3\' will reduce stress significantly. Node_4 can be moved slightly right (x>3.05) and slightly up or down to balance.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: member_4 (node_2 to node_4) length = sqrt((6-3.05)^2 + (0-3.3)^2) ≈ sqrt(8.7 + 10.89) = sqrt(19.59) ≈ 4.43; mass = length * area. Area \'1\' = 0.195, mass ~0.8631 matches. Increasing area to \'2\' (0.782) will increase mass by about 4x for that member (~3.46 mass). Total mass will increase ~2.6 from 15.16 to ~17.8, still <30. This is acceptable.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Increase area of member_4 from \'1\' to \'2\' to reduce max stress. Slightly move node_4 right from 3.05 to 3.15 and slightly up from 3.3 to 3.4 to improve force distribution. New node_4 (3.15, 3.4). Member lengths recalculated, mass updated. Expect max stress drop below 16.21, total mass increase but still within limit. Members remain connected as before.
