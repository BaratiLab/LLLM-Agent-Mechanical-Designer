Supports fixed at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Constraints are max stress must be within ±15 and mass ≤ 30 units. Current max stress is 28.23 too high. Mass 23.8934 is acceptable but close to limit. Areas chosen from given set.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Existing design has a complex joint of nodes 4, 5, 6 causing high compressive stress (-28.23 on member_4). Member_7 from node_1 to load node_3 -19.9375 also exceeds stress. Members connecting intermediate nodes may cause stress concentrations. Need to simplify and create truss paths that reduce bending and large compression stresses. Maintain supports and load nodes fixed; add or move intermediate nodes for force resolution to avoid high member force.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on stable triangular substructures linking supports to load. Possibly move node_5 upward and slightly left, remove or reposition node_6 to eliminate weak links. Use stiffer areas on high load members but keep mass low. Plan members to form truss with direct load path transfer from node_3 to supports. Shorter segments with balanced tensile and compression members to reduce peak stress.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Keep nodes 1, 2, 3 fixed. Remove node_6. Move node_4 slightly up to (2.0, 3.0).

A simpler triangular truss with distributed load paths.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Elevating node_4 provides a taller triangle to distribute vertical load better, while node_5 moves away from complex joint for simpler load path.
