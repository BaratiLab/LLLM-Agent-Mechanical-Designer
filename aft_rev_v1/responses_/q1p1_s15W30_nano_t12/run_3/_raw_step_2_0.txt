Improve stress constraint primarily while controlling mass.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load applied as 10 units @ 45° downward-left at node_3. Supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller) on x-axis. Current nodes: 5 total with 5 members. Highest stress in member_1 (node_1-node_3) at 43.2, member_4 at 31.3 — both exceed limit. Some members hold zero stress, implying ineffective members. Members with larger areas correlate with high mass. Geometry is currently stretched with limited triangulation and load path redundancy, causing high stress concentration. Need to add nodes or better triangulation to reduce peak stress and spread load effectively.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove ineffective members (stress near zero), add intermediate nodes on load path from node_3 to supports, possibly below load node to form load transfer triangles. Use smaller area on lower force members and larger area on high force members to meet stress conditions.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Modify design by adding one new intermediate node below node_3 for improved load path, reposition internal node_5 to better distribute forces, revise member areas. Connect node_3 to node_4 and node_4 to both supports for multiple triangles. Use smallest possible areas for low-stress tension members, and moderate/high areas for compression/tension parts. Preserve load/support nodes positions.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding a node below node_3 enables stiffer triangulation reducing bending and stresses in node_1-node_3 member and distributes stresses across additional members. Node_5 repositioned to (4.0,1.2) reduces member length slightly and spreads forces more evenly for lighter and lower stress members. Areas tuned per member stress demand following constraints. Expect improved max stress below ±15 with total mass under 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and tentative forces: use areas 3 or 2 for main compression members; 1 or 0 for tension members with low forces.
