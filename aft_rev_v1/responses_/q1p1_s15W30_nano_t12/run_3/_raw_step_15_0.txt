Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Current mass 40.18>30 limit. Max stress 14.68<15 passes. Need to reduce mass by redesign without raising stress over 15.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has large mass from three heavy members (members 1 & 2 with area 4 and member 8 with area 3). The load path is from node_3 down-left and towards supports. Members from node_4 to node_2 and node_1 take significant load. There\'s redundancy over nodes 5,6,7 increasing mass. Most stresses near limit but area sizes and member lengths exceed the mass constraint. Need simpler topology, smaller cross sections and rethink node layout to maintain strength and length efficiency.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on minimal extra nodes; possibly remove node_7 and node_6 or reposition. Optimize major members with mid-size areas to balance stress and mass. Use node_5 carefully. Lower larger areas where possible and shorten key members. Ensure members crossed for triangulation keeping structure stable.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Simplify to 5 main nodes besides load/support: Keep nodes 1,2,3 fixed, reposition node_4 upwards and node_5 between node_3 and node_2 closer to reduce member length. Remove nodes 6 and 7, skip node_6 diagonal members. Member set revised to create two triangles: triangle 1 (1-4-3) and triangle 2 (4-5-2-3), producing a stable, lightweight truss.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Shortening members and reducing area drastically cuts mass. Small areas in low stress tension and compression members reduce mass but must remain capacity-sufficient for stress. Minimal nodes and material simplifies structure. Triangulation ensures statically stable. Use member length × area area values to check mass <30.
