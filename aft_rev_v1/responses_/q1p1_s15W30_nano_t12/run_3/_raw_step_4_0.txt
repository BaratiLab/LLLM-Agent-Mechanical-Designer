Supports at nodes 1(pinned) and 2(roller). Current mass 75.6 > 30 (too heavy). Stresses max 4.85 within ±15 allowed. Need major mass reduction, better layout and targeted area assignment.",\n  "analysis": "Current structure has too many heavy members (areas 4 and 5 mostly) causing high mass to 75+. Stress is controlled well, but overbuilt member sizes and complicated internal nodes increase mass. Load location at mid-span suggests classic triangular truss with simpler load path could be optimal.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove members with area>3 if not critical. Simplify mid nodes. Position nodes to create 2 triangles for load transfer from node_3 to supports. Trim node count to minimum to reduce member length total. Calculate member lengths and select smaller areas, enable effective stress control below 15 limit.",\n  "proposal": "Design a minimal truss with nodes: supports node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), load node_3(2,0) plus top and bottom nodes to form two stable triangles. Add node_4 top at (3,3.5), node_5 bottom at (3,-1.5). Connect nodes 1-4,4-2,1-5,5-2,3-4,3-5 for load transfer. Smaller cross-section areas mostly 1,2,3 to limit mass.",\n  "reasoning": "Two-triangle symmetrical layout transfers load with minimal members and shorter lengths, reducing total member length. Using mostly area ids <=3 lowers mass under 30 while controlling stresses by proper force distribution. Avoid members spanning between nodes with large horizontal disparity which increases length.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: n1-n4 ~3.605, n4-n2 ~3.605, n1-n5 ~3.354, n5-n2 ~3.354, n3-n4 ~3.162, n3-n5 ~1.5 Approximate areas chosen to balance stress capacity and mass. Areas selected based on allowable stress and load. Total mass estimation must be below 30.",\n  "calculation": "Calculate total length: 3.605+3.605+3.354+3.354+3.162+1.5=18.58 Units area weighted sum assign areas: member n1-n4 area 3(arr33.1 mass), n4-n2 area3, n1-n5 area2, n5-n2 area2, n3-n4 area1, n3-n5 area1. Mass = sum(length*area_value). Total mass roughly=3.6*3.128*2 + (3.354*0.782)*2 + (3.162*0.195) + (1.5*0.195)=~23.7 <30 Limit.
