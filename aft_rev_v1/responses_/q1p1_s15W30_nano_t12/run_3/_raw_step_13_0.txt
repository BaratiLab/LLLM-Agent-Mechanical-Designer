Load at node_3 at 45° left down direction. Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Preserve support/load nodes. Current design mass ~30.13, max stress ~9 well within limits but mass slightly over. Target is to reduce total mass below 30 while maintaining stress limits.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure at iteration 12 is close to constraints but total mass is slightly above 30. Main stress contributors are moderate and members have moderate area sizes (2,3). Presence of node_7 off-center with mostly members in areas 2 & 3. Member_7 and member_8 carry zero stress, could consider removing or reallocation. Geometry well positioned vertically and horizontally. Load location at node_3 creates bending needs. Some members overlap or have complex geometry. Strategy is to reduce unnecessary members or downsizing aligned members that carry minor load, maybe optimize node_5 location closer to main load-support lines. Possibly merge or remove node_7 since it connects but carries zero or low load members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_7 may be redundant. Members_7 and _8 both zero stress, reduce mass by removing them or decrease area. Node_5 may shift to allow minimized spans or fewer members. Member_1 to 3 area can be reduced since stress is far from limits. Areas can be scaled down to minimize mass. Check members with smallest stresses and consider targeted removal or smaller cross-sectional area. Bottom chord member_4 has stress -4.01, can reduce area. Co-linear members can be reduced to minimize duplicate stiffness. Find near-triangular shape for stable truss with minimal members and efficient tension/compression paths.",\n\n  "proposal": "Maintain nodes node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0) as is. Remove node_7 and corresponding members 6,7,8 to reduce mass. Slightly shift node_5 to (3.5,1.4). Maintain node_4 at (2,3). Members: member_1 (node_1-node_4) - area 2; member_2 (node_4-node_2) - area 2; member_3 (node_1-node_3) - area 1; member_4 (node_3-node_2) - area 1; member_5 (node_4-node_5) - area 1; member_6 (node_5-node_3) - area 1; member_7 (node_5-node_2) - area 2. Total 7 members, removing unnecessary members with zero load. Optimize areas down to reduce mass with conservative stress safety margins.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Removing node_7 and zero stress members reduces complexity and mass without compromising support to critical load paths. Areas are set proportional to stress estimate - members directly under load have smaller areas due to reduced expected stress (±15 limit). The incomes and reaction forces transfer through node_4 effectively. Node_5 relocates slightly to reduce member length and mass. Member zones evaluated to reduce areas further as stress mostly low, maintaining safety. Given reduced members and areas, total mass will be within target below 30. Maintaining current vertical coverage at y=3 retains the height for stability. Member arrangement forms a basic truss (triangular substructures), encouraging compression/tension in members properly minimizing bending. Support conditions unchanged ensuring stability.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and masses to confirm total mass ≤ 30. Validate max stress under ±15 given smaller areas but maintained structure. Member lengths approx: m1 ~3.605, m2 ~4.472, m3=2, m4=4, m5~1.3, m6~2.06, m7~2.24. Areas as integers from area dict (1=0.195, 2=0.782, 3=1.759). Use conservative sizing: areas (member_1:2=0.782, m2:2=0.782, m3:1=0.195, m4:1=0.195, m5:1=0.195, m6:1=0.195, m7:2=0.782). Mass=sum(length*area). Check total sum: about (3.6*0.782)+(4.47*0.782)+(2*0.195)+(4*0.195)+(1.3*0.195)+(2.06*0.195)+(2.24*0.782) ≈ 2.82+3.5+0.39+0.78+0.25+0.40+1.75 = approx 9.9 in terms of area-meter units multiplied by density? Normalized weight in previous used units; confirm with previous value: mass should be about 25-27 range from history scaling with similar areas.
