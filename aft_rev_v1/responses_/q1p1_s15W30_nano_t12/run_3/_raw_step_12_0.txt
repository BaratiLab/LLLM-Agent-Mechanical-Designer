Max stress 13.06 within ±15 limit. Supports and loads fixed. Optimize less stressed design with improved geometry for stress reduction.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress = 13.06 is near limit, with member_3 at -13.06 and few other compressive members medium stressed. Areas mostly 2 or 3. Geometry is fairly optimized with node_7 added to reduce stress healing. Load on node_3 is -10 at -45°, fixed support nodes unchanged. Slight relocation of intermediate nodes can redistribute forces and reduce stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member forces: key compression in member_3, tension in member_1. Nodes near load and support fixed. Members include diagonals and triangle members. Areas can be tuned in 1-3 range for mass/stress trade-off.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Relocate node_7 (2,2) slightly upward to better triangulate load path reducing member_3 compression. Possibly slight shift node_5 (4,1.5) towards node_2 reducing moment arm. Keep member area ids same or reduce area in underloaded members and increase in most stressed member_3 to redistribute. Ensure triangle closed structure maintained. Total mass margin permits small increase if stress reduces.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Key equations: Stress = Force / Area. Increase area reduces stress. Length changes affect member forces. Mass sum(length x area). Keep areas in {1,0.195,0.782,1.759,3.128...}. Member_6 area 3 can remain, member_3 area 2 increased to 3 to reduce stress.

Member areas: member_3 upgraded to area id 3 (1.759), member_7 remains 2, member_8 remains 2. Mass increases but inside 30 limit. Expected max stress reduction approx 13 to ~10 due to better load path and increased area. Mass: ~6.3+8.8+(1.7 instead of1.56)+3.1+(0.7)+(3.5)+(1.6)+(2) ~ 29.5 < 30.
