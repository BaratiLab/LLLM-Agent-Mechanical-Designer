  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss with 1 load, 2 supports, comply with stress ±15 and mass ≤30.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 (-10N, -45°), pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Current max stress ~52 exceeds ±15 limit, total mass 25.7 under limit. Optimize to reduce peak stress, maintain or slightly increase mass but ≤30. Current member areas 1,3,4 cause overstress; resizing and geometry adjustment needed.",

  "analysis": "High compressive stress (~-52) at member_1 and excessive tensile stress at member_2. Lower area members_1 and _2 (area_id=1) yield high stress due to load near end support. Larger cross-section on these critical bottom chords and redistributing load paths via adding nodes can improve performance. Vertical displacement node_4 at (2,3) with large area members suffers little stress indication possible inefficient load path. Member_5 overly large area yet low stress indicates inefficient area distribution. Overall structure resembles a simple triangular frame but high stress on bottom members means load intense near node_3 on small members. Need to add and shift nodes to create more even load distribution and member sizing.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Add intermediate nodes near load and supports under load path to make a more triangular, optimized configuration. Increase area of high stress members to mid-size (area_id 3 to 5). Reduce member_5 cross section to target stress around ±15. Use node between node_3 and node_4 at mid height to allow double load paths. Avoid duplicating nodes, keep old supports and load nodes fixed.",

  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (4.0,1.5) between node_2 and node_4. Redefine members: bottom chords thicker (area_id~5), inclined members medium area (3 or 4), vertical members slimmer to reduce mass. Structure forms a truss with two triangles sharing top nodes, redistribute stress evenly.",

  "reasoning": "The load at node_3 generates high compressive stress in member_1 and tensile stress in member_2 due to small cross-section. Adding node_5 at (4,1.5) adds an extra chord, redistributes tensile and compressive effects on two chords from load to roller support. Thickening bottom chords reduces stress below limits. Choosing areas across available values keeps mass under limit. Shifting member_5 to slimmer section to balance mass. Maintaining pinned and roller nodes position, intermediate node_5 allows more favorable force paths.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths calc: node_1 to node_3 = 2 (x), bottom chords thickness to area_id=5 (4.887); member_1 length 2, mass = length*area approx 2*4.887=9.774. Current member_5 area is 4, length approx 3.354, mass=3.354*3.128 = 10.5 excess. Reduce member_5 to area_id=3 reduces mass to ~10.6, manageable. Total mass estimated ≈ 0.39+0.78 + thicker areas ~below 30. Stress reduced since thick members handle load better.",

  "calculation": "Node_5 at (4.0,1.5). Members: member_1(node_1-node_3, area_id=5), member_2(node_3-node_5, area_id=3), member_3(node_5-node_2, area_id=5), member_4(node_1-node_4, area_id=3), member_5(node_4-node_5, area_id=3). Member lengths: m1=2.0, m2=√((4-2)^2+(1.5-0)^2)=2.5, m3=√((6-4)^2+(0-1.5)^2)=2.5, m4=3.0, m5=√((4-2)^2+(1.5-3)^2)=2.5. Estimate mass = sum(m(i)*area_i) approx (2*4.887)+(2.5*1.759)+(2.5*4.887)+(3*1.759)+(2.5*1.759)=9.774 +4.398 +12.2175 +5.277 +4.398= approx 36, need reduce areas slightly for mass<30. Reduce area_id(5) to 4 (3.128), total mass then approx = (2*3.128)+(2.5*1.759)+(2.5*3.128)+(3*1.759)+(2.5*1.759)=6.256+4.398+7.82+5.277+4.398= about 28 total. Stress expected less than ±15 by doubling load paths and bigger cross-section.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "All support nodes fixed. Load node fixed. Added node 5 to redistribute forces. Increased thickness of high stress chords to area_id=4. Mass is below 30. Expected max stress below 15 per constraint. Final design yields feasible truss structure with no duplicate nodes or members.",
