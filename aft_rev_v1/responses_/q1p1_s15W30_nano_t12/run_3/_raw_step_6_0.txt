Member_5 compressive at -6.31 and others low. Increase member_6 length and optimize geometry to reduce stress concentration. The structure is sufficiently light so area distribution can stay or slightly reduced where stress low.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress dominated by diagonal members 3-4 (member_6) and 4-5 (member_3).

At iteration 5, node_3 fixed as load node: (2.0, 0.0). Current node_4 at (2.0, 2.0), node_5 at (4.0, 1.0). Move node_4 upwards to decrease compressive stress on member_6 by increasing length.
