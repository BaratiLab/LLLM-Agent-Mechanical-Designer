Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Existing nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2,2.5), node_5(3.8,0.8). Max stress exceeds +15 on member_4 (node_5-node_3). Mass is acceptable near 22.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High tensile stress on member from node_5 to node_3 area=1. Areas used mostly small to medium. Need to reduce stress from 35.8 to ≤15, plausibly by rearranging and adding support paths. Current nodes moderate, but adding a node above node_5 can improve load path and reduce member_4 stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_4 high tensile indicates load path ineffective. Adding a node (node_6) above node_5 to transfer force to node_4 and node_2 allows members to share load, reduce stress in member_4. Increase areas only where necessary. Avoid heavy areas to contain mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_6 above node_5 at (3.8,1.8). Connect node_6 to node_4 and node_5. Remove member_4 (node_5-node_3). Connect node_6 to node_3 instead with lower area. Use mainly areas 2 and 3 for members near node_6 to keep stresses limited but mass low. Maintain supports and loads nodes.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "High stress on member_4 (node_5 to node_3) is reduced by removing direct load and replacing it with a triangular truss formed by node_3-node_6-node_5. Node_6 acts as intermediate support node to redistribute forces. Areas are selected moderate to maintain strength but keep mass low, reuse area IDs 2 and 3 as effective tradeoffs for stress distribution. Short member lengths due to vertical node_6 keep mass controlled. Members between primary supports kept to area 3 for moderate mass and stiffness. Existing nodes used unchanged except the new node_6 for routing.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check length,mass: member lengths approx: node_1-node_4 ~sqrt(2^2+2.5^2)=3.201, node_4-node_2=4.0 approx, node_4-node_6 ~sqrt((3.8-2)^2+(1.8-2.5)^2)=1.85, node_6-node_5=1.0, node_6-node_3 ~sqrt((3.8-2)^2+(1.8-0)^2)=2.28, node_5-node_2 = sqrt((6-3.8)^2+(0-0.8)^2)=2.4, node_1-node_3=2.0.

Total mass within limits from approximate sum.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Mass approx sum(length×area) estimated below 28. Stresses approximated reduced due to load transfer via node_6.
