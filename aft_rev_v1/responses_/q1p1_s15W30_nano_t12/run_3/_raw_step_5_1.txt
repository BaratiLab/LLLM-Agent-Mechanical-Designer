Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Constraints: max stress ±15, max mass 30. Current max stress ~31, mass ~22.5. Current members and nodes yield overstress especially on members connected to node_3. Load nodes unchanged, can add/move/remove intermediate nodes.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current truss with nodes mostly aligned along x-0, center-top/bottom nodes with small supports and short members yields high stress on short tension members from node_3. Using small area (1, 0.195) on these highly stressed members insufficient. Heavy and overstressed diagonals not optimal. Need better load path with more triangulated form to reduce member forces and get greater force distribution. Mass budget allows slight increase, can\'t heavily upsize members without exceeding mass.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Triangulate load node node_3 to supports node_1 and node_2 via two separate vertical nodes if needed. Area options suggest need mid to high section IDs for longer or more stressed members. Reducing length of highly stressed members by introducing internal vertical nodes near node_3 with stronger diagonal bracing can lower stress. Avoid hinge patterns, maintain static determinacy.",\n\n    "proposal": "Add two internal nodes at approx. (2.0, 2.0) and (4.0, 1.0). Connect node_3 to them, create diagonal members from these to supports, and connect these nodes vertically and horizontally to distribute forces. Use moderate area \'3\' for support diagonals, \'2\' for shorter vertical, and max 4 for highly stressed short partircles. Remove members with stress concentration. Avoid members directly connecting node_3 to ground nodes except via these nodes.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Adding node near load to create more force paths and redistribute load is standard. Intermediate nodes raise triangulation and lower stress per member. Using area \'3\' (~1.76) for primary diagonal supports adequate upon length+multiplication. Vertical node decreased length needed per member hence better stress management. Keep areas small where stress low. No member length exceed restraint-mass. Multiple triangular loops stabilize structure and meet stationarity.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and check feasibility: \\n- node_1 to node_4(2,2): length = sqrt(2²+2²)=2.828\\n- node_4(2,2) to node_3(2,0): length = 2.0\\n- node_4(2,2) to node_5(4,1): length = sqrt(2²+1²)=2.236\\n- node_5(4,1) to node_2(6,0): length = sqrt(2²+1²)=2.236\\n- node_5(4,1) to node_3(2,0): length = sqrt(2²+1²)=2.236\\n- node_4(2,2) to node_1(0,0): 2.828 (already known)\\n- node_5 to node_2 same length.\\nAreas choice balances stress and mass: maximize area on most stressed diagonal/frequently loaded members (3 or 4), minimize on vertical or lightly loaded(2).",\n\n    "calculation": "Mass = sum member_length × section_area\\n- member_1: node_1-node_4: 2.828×1.76=4.98\\n- member_2: node_4-node_2: 4.47×1.76=7.87 (adjust node_4 x from 2->1.5 to shorten this member slightly) \\n- member_3: node_4-node_5: 2.236×0.782=1.75\\n- member_4: node_5-node_3: 2.236×0.782=1.75\\n- member_5: node_5-node_2: 2.236×1.76=3.94\\n- member_6: node_3-node_4: 2.0×0.782=1.56\\nTotal mass ~22 - 24 within 30 limit.\\nExpected lower max stress since force redistributed via two paths and shorter critical members.
