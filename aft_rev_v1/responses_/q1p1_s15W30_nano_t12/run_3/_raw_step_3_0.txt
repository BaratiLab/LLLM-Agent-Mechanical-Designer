Current max stress ~3098, far above limit; mass 21.95 below limit. Existing member_3 highly stressed (compression). Load on node_3 at -45°. Supports fixed: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Nodes at 0,0; 6,0; node_3 on x=2 too close to supports likely causes high stress concentration. Need to adjust internal node positions and connectivity to reduce stress, maintain support and load nodes.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design shows severe local overstress, mainly on member_3 (node_3 to node_5). The node_6 added below main chord likely created a large eccentricity causing compression buckling and high stress. Member areas mostly small (3 or less), which is insufficient for load. Structure needs stronger bracing and redistributing load path. Node_4 (2,3) is useful top node, but node_5 position at (4,1.2) creates long slender members under compression. Using symmetric node placement above and below main chord may help balance load and reduce stress magnitude on individual members. Increasing truss height increases strength-to-weight ratio. A truss with two nodes above chord at about x=2 and x=4, balanced with corresponding nodes below chord, can carry load with better load path. Use varied area sizes, mostly low to moderate, but assign largest areas to longest or highest stress members. Total mass must remain below 30.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Need new intermediate nodes for efficient triangulation, avoid overly long eccentric members. Remove node_6 based on its negative influence. Position node_4 just shifted slightly upward for better load transfer. Add symmetrical lower nodes near x=2 and x=4. Connect members to create parallel chord system or Warren truss-style configuration. Evaluate member lengths and approximate stress based on geometry and loading direction.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep supports at node_1 (0,0) and node_2 (6,0), load at node_3 (2,0). Add node_4 shifted slightly to (2,3.5), node_5 at (4,3.5) and add node_6 at (4,-1.5) and node_7 at (2,-1.5). Connect chord bottom: node_1-node_3-node_2; chord top: node_4-node_5; bottom extra: node_7-node_6. Web members: node_3-node_5, node_3-node_4, node_6-node_2, node_7-node_1, node_4-node_6, node_5-node_7. Area selection mostly 2 to 5. Longest members with 5-6 area, shortest web members with area 1-2. This balanced truss relieves compression in critical member and distributes load by more vertical triangles.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "A typical Warren-type truss with added lower chord web nodes stabilizes compression members to remain under buckling stress. By moving top nodes higher and adding corresponding lower nodes, compressive and tensile stresses reduce. The pin and roller placement at ends create statically determinate system. At 6m span, increased height to 3.5m improves strength-to-weight. Assigning higher cross-section areas to longer members following stress hypothesis keeps mass low (~28-30). Various low area members reduce total mass. More triangulation reduces bending and directional shear stress concentration.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths roughly: bottom chord <2m (node_1 to node_3=2m, node_3 to node_2=4m total, but node_3 is at 2m), vertical height 3.5m, diagonals ~4m. Total mass estimate ≈ sum(length * area). Max stress target ±15 achieved by increased height, additional bracing and moderate areas. Area codes: 0=1.0, 1=0.195, 2=0.782, 3=1.759, 4=3.128, 5=4.887, 6=7.037.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths approx: node_1-node_3=2.0m, node_3-node_2=4.0m; node_4-node_5=2.0m; verticals node_4-node_6 ~4.33m; node_5-node_7 ~4.03m diagonal node_4-node_6 and node_5-node_7 create triangles 3.5 height + 2-4 horizontal. Assign member areas (area_id): \'member_1\': node_1-node_3 area 5 (4.887), \'member_2\': node_3-node_2 area 5 (4.887), \'member_3\': node_4-node_5 area 3 (1.759), \'member_4\': node_1-node_7 area 3 (1.759), \'member_5\': node_7-node_6 area 0 (1.0), \'member_6\': node_6-node_2 area 3 (1.759), \'member_7\': node_3-node_5 area 4 (3.128), \'member_8\': node_3-node_4 area 4 (3.128), \'member_9\': node_6-node_4 area 2 (0.782), \'member_10\': node_5-node_7 area 2 (0.782).
