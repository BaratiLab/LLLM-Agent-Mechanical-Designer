  "preamble": "Optimize current truss node positions to reduce max stress below 14 and mass under 30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 14.11 is close to limit Â±15. Mass 21.83 below 30 limit. Load on node_3 fixed; support nodes fixed. Nodes to move: node_4 and node_5 only.",
  
  "analysis": "Since max stress is from member_6 (-14.11), connecting nodes 3 and 4, and member_3 (12.62) connecting 4-5, focus on node_4 and 5 positions to reduce stress. Member_5 compressive at -6.31 and others low. Increase member_6 length and optimize geometry to reduce stress concentration. The structure is sufficiently light so area distribution can stay or slightly reduced where stress low.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress dominated by diagonal members 3-4 (member_6) and 4-5 (member_3). Can shape triangle between nodes 3-4-5 to reduce sharp angle and elongate some members to reduce stresses. Try raising node_4 upwards gently, moving node_5 slightly toward load to improve force flow.",

  "reasoning": "Node_1 and node_2 supports must remain fixed. At iteration 5, node_3 fixed as load node: (2.0, 0.0). Current node_4 at (2.0, 2.0), node_5 at (4.0, 1.0). Move node_4 upwards to decrease compressive stress on member_6 by increasing length. Move node_5 closer to node_3 vertically to align members better and reduce bending. Areas for members: continue with current areas best matching loads except reduce areas on low stress (member_4 stress zero, can reduce area).",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Max stress = 14.11; target safely under 15, try 13. Pay attention to mass 21.83 < 30, small room for area increase if needed to relieve stress. Adjust node_4 from 2.0, 2.0 to ~2.0, 2.5; adjust node_5 from 4.0,1.0 to 3.8, 0.8. Recalculate member lengths, area ids chosen from given set to control stress and mass. Drop member_4 area from 2(0.782) to 1(0.195) as stress zero.",
  
  "calculation": "Member lengths approx: \n- member_6 (node_3-node_4): dist ~ sqrt((2.0-2.0)^2 + (2.5-0)^2) = 2.5 \n- member_3 (node_4-node_5): dist sqrt((3.8-2.0)^2 + (0.8-2.5)^2) ~ sqrt(3.24 +2.89)= sqrt(6.13)=2.48 \nAreas assigned: member_6: 2(0.782), member_3: 2(0.782), member_4: 1(0.195) reduced \nMass approx sum(length*area): member_1 ~ length 2.69* area 3=1.759=4.73?, member_2 similar  \nTotal mass stays < 22. Maintain others at previous areas.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Appropriate geometry modifications and minor area reductions recommended. Max stress expected to drop below 14, mass will remain low. Next FEM step will verify breaking constraints or not.",
