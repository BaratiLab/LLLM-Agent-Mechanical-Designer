Supports fixed. Available nodes fixed except internal ones can be added. Max stress currently too high (-29 vs ±15 allowed). Mass is under limit (21.67 < 30). Aim to reduce stresses especially on member_5 (-29).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has member_5 highly overstressed in compression beyond limits. Increasing number of members or redistributing forces by adding nodes and members to reduce demand in overstressed member is necessary. Load at node_3 pulls diagonally downward left, causing high stress on those members. Members around node_3 are stressed heavily, indicating need for modified configuration around this node with vertical and diagonal supports distributing load better. Member areas currently mostly small (1,2,3). Increasing some areas strategically could help reduce stress but mass constraint is easily respected now, so enlarging some members is allowed. However, topology and node position improvement preferred over just increasing areas.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding node near node_3 at higher elevation and adding members linking node_3 to higher nodes could redistribute its load path better. Newly positioned node allows triangulation.

Remove member_7, add new members: member_7: node_6-node_3, member_8: node_6-node_5, member_9: node_6-node_4. Use areas 2 or 3 for these members to give moderate stiffness. Adjust existing members area: keep member_5 area_1 to reduce weight and stress but add supportive members with area_2-3.\\nNew members provide improved triangulation and load path reducing stress at node_3 related members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "By adding a node above node_3, the downward diagonal load (-45°) can be transferred better through additional members with triangulated layout. Adding members node_6 connects to nodes around node_3 for improved stiffness and force distribution. This reduces max compression in member_5, currently overstressed. Moderate area values avoids mass increase over 30, supports better stress distribution. Triangular substructure formed improves force path and stiffness around high loads. Structural mechanics favor triangulated frames to manage combined vertical and lateral loading. Pinned and roller supports retained at fixed positions.
