Areas discrete selections per table.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Given 3 nodes in a line, to form a closed truss, add at least one more node above to create a triangle. Nodal positions of node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed along x-axis but node_3 is inside segment 0-6 at x=2. Load acts down-left 45°, so truss members should efficiently carry tensile and compressive forces. Optimal shape is triangular to close and create direct load paths. Edge members will be connected between base nodes and new apex node above x=2, y>0 for stability and minimize bending. Supports: pinned (no displacement) at node_1 and roller (vertical movement restrained) at node_2 help resolve reactions.

With 4 nodes, the base segment node_1-node_2 (horizontal length 6) supports main reaction; node_4 connects at center to split forces equally. Using equilibrium equations at node_3 (load applied) gives member forces; selecting areas to keep stress below ±15. Mass minimization is by minimizing total area × length sum under 30. Assumptions: linear static, axial forces only, negligible bending, use Euclidean distances for length, forces resolved at nodes, truss members perfect pins.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Design node_4: point (2.0, h), h optimized for equilibrium (guess h = 3.0).

Analyzing equilibrium at node_3: members connected are node_1-3, node_3-2, node_3-4. Assume tensile positive. Balance vertical and horizontal forces for node_3, solve F_M1, F_M2, F_M5. Using simplified statics: F_M1 + F_M2 horizontal components + F_M5 horizontal component = 7.07 N (reaction). Vertical components sum = 7.07 N upward. Approximate forces found: F_M1=6N compression, F_M2=6N compression, F_M5=10N tension. Others carry reaction: Assume equal share for node_1-4 and node_4-2 bearing soil, select areas accordingly.
