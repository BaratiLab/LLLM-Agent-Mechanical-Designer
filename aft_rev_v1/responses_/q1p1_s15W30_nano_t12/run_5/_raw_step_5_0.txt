Load on node_3, supports fixed. Node movement only allowed for intermediate nodes: node_4, node_5. Area selections from discrete options are used.",\n  "analysis": "Current design has all constraints met with safety margin in stress and mass. Maximum compressive and tensile stresses are below Â±15. The mass is substantially below max allowed 30. The nodal positions at nodes 4 and 5 complement the geometry to achieve these results. FEM confirms internal forces balanced with limited stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Mini stress margin indicates limited potential for further stress reduction by moving node_4 or node_5 which might adversely affect stress/mass balance. Member areas are low occupancy but appropriate for loading. Further refinement unlikely to significantly reduce max stress below 11.6 due to load placement and shortest member lengths.",\n  "reasoning": "Since constraints are met comfortably, risk of overoptimization causing constraint violation makes continuing optimization non-beneficial. Node positions of nonfixed nodes are well distributed to spread load paths. Member area assignments balance load spectra. Further reduction of max stress likely minimal based on load/support nodes fixed and previous history shows large stress improvement between iterations 0-3, and now stress minimized.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member stresses (-11.66, +9.11 max approx) chosen areas (1,2,3) with areas 0.195,0.782,1.759 m^2 respectively balance structural stiffness and mass. Member lengths range moderate 1.1 to ~4.5 m, node_4 at (3.5,2.8), node_5 at (4.6,1.5) creates optimal triangular topology balancing force components.",\n  "calculation": "Verification of max stress: 11.6639 < 15 allowed. Total mass sum of memb_mass is 19.4124 < 30 max. Supports pinned and roller fixed nodes at correct positions (0,0) and (6,0). Load applied at (2,0). Nodal shifts would likely cause mass or stress penalty. Continuing iterations yield diminishing returns.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "No overlaps or duplicate nodes/members found.
