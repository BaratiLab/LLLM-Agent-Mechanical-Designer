  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to minimize stress within ±15 and mass <= 30, using given fixed nodes, single load, supports, close all nodes.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Three nodes: node_1(0,0,pinned), node_2(6,0,roller), node_3(2,0) under -10N at 45° downward. Goal: closed truss, minimal stress and mass per constraints. Fixed node positions do not change.",
  
  "analysis": "Current nodes lie on x-axis at 0,2,6. Loaded at node_3 with downward-left force. To be closed and stable under horizontal and vertical loads, must form a triangle connecting all nodes. No existing vertical height; to reduce stress, add one node raised in y-direction to form triangular shape, enabling load resolution with axial forces in members. Longer vertical members cause more mass and possibly stress. Area selection and member layout key to balancing stress and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Idea: add node_4 with y>0 between node_3 and node_2 on x=4 for geometric balance. Connect node_4 to node_1, node_2, node_3 to create a triangular closed truss: nodes (1,3,4)+(4,2)+(3,2) forming multize top. Analyze stress via static equilibrium, select appropriate member areas from given values.",
  
  "reasoning": "To keep structure closed and statically determinate, add one node_4 at (4.0, 3.0) to create a triangle with node_3 and node_2. Members: (1-3), (1-4), (2-4), (3-4), (2-3). Load at node_3 creates tension/compression mainly in members connecting to node_4. Using trigonometry and static equilibrium at loaded node and supports, solve forces. To restrict stresses <= 15, choose cross section areas inversely proportional to calculated axial forces. Favor smallest mass areas satisfying stress limit.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic, axial forces only, steel-like material, uniform area per member chosen from given set. Load decomposed into x and y components: Fx= -10*cos45= -7.07N; Fy= -10*sin45= -7.07N. Equilibrium satisfied by tension/compression in members at nodes. Calculate member lengths with distance formula and use force/area = stress; mass = sum(length*area) <=30. Cross-check stress constraint with max force/area.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Given load and node arrangement, adding node_4 at (4,3) creates a closed structure with 5 members. Selecting areas mostly 0.782 (area id '2') and 0.195 (id '1') for lighter members maintained mass <30 and stress <15. Structure meets constraints well.",
