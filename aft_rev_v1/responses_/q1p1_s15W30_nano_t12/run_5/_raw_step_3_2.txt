Supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller, load -10N at node_3 at -45°. Load at midspan, need to reduce member stress by better load path and member area selection.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The current design member_1 is highly stressed (-65.27). Reducing length of critical members, adding appropriate bracing, and increasing areas where stressed will help. Mass budget is large (max 30), so area can be increased within limits. Members directly connected to load and supports must be well supported. Node positions 1 and 2 fixed. Node_3 placed at 2m; it\'s the load point at bottom chord. Node_4 at [3, 2.5] only gives one top chord node. Likely need to add extra nodes (like upper nodes) to improve triangular bracing. Member_4 with large area but still stress is only ~9 MPa, so consider redesign from geometry to better distribute forces.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Add a node above node_3 and node_2 to form two triangles spreading load, select moderate to larger area for tension members, keep compressive members shorter, increase top chord height modestly to reduce axial forces.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Keep node_1, node_2, and node_3 fixed. Add node_4 at [4.0, 3.0], node_5 at [3.5, 4.0] to better triangulate. Form members: lower chord (node_1 to node_3 to node_2), upper chord (node_4 to node_5), diagonals to transfer forces optimally. Assign areas from available table: use area=3 for compressive members, area=2 for less stressed, area=1 for lightly stressed members. Structure includes 6 members to resolve stability and stress constraints.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Adding node_4 and node_5 creates two triangular panels distributing load from node_3 more efficiently. This increases geometric stiffness and reduces peak tensile/compressive stress. Using moderate large areas (e.g. \'3\' area_id =1.759) on high load members balances mass and strength constraints. Avoid oversized areas to keep mass below 30. Avoid long compressive members to prevent buckling risk with smaller area or shorter lengths.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Members: member_1: node_1-node_3 area=3; member_2: node_3-node_4 area=3; member_3: node_4-node_5 area=2; member_4: node_5-node_2 area=3; member_5: node_3-node_5 area=1; member_6: node_4-node_2 area=2.
