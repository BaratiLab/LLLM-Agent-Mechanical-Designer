Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Existing structure too heavy (44 >30) and overstressed (max stress ±60>>15). ",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure dense with 7 members including a long heavy member_2 (area=4) causing large mass and stress. Member_5 overstressed in compression (-60). Members mostly oversized in mass 4~15 area entries. Truss is unbalanced with high top nodes at (4,5). ",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove heavy thick members and nodes contributing little to load path. Simplify to stable triangular truss connecting supports and load node. Keep existing support/load nodes fixed, but move/add internal nodes smartly. Minimize member lengths and use small areas to keep mass<30 and stresses inside ±15.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Four nodes total: fixed node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), and node_3(2,0) load node. Add intermediate node_4 at (3,2.5) close overhead to distribute force effectively. Members connecting: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_3-node_2 - forming a stiff truss diamond shape. Member areas limited to area_id=1 (0.195) or 2 (0.782) to reduce mass. ",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular and diamond meshes avoid large compression. Shorter member lengths reduce self-weight. Lower cross-section area reduces parts mass. Intermediate node_4 placed near load node at elevated height to reduce overturning moment and improve load transfer. Redundant members reduced and topology simplified to fundamental structural form meeting equilibrium and stiffness requirements. ",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Members lengths estimated by distance formula; sum(length × area_density) for mass. Estimate axial forces roughly; expected max force ±10N typical. Using area 1 for low mass and lower cross-sectional stress for ±15MPa range. Members chosen to spread load and reduce stress concentrations; member sections scaled accordingly.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(3,2.5).
