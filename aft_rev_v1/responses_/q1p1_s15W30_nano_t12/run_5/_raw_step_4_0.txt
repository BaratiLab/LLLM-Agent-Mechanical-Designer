Current max stress=26.43>15, mass=22.68<30. Need to reduce stress to ±15, rearrange, possibly reduce areas or add supports for better stiffness and force distribution.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design\'s highest compressive stress is -26.43 at member_5 (node_3-node_5). Mass is under limit but several member stresses exceed ±15. Existing node_5 at (3.5,4.0) producing high stresses and some inefficiency in force paths. Current members and areas inefficient to keep stress below threshold. Node_3 and node_4 are elevated from baseline, but triangle geometry could be refined. Some longer members with small areas cause stress concentration, while others are oversized. Adding a strategic node to create shorter, stiffer members and redistribute load better should reduce max stress. Preserve load/support nodes, optimize structure to a lean truss with well-sized members and triangular bracing symmetrical to load.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Idea: Move node_4 to optimize height (below 3.5m) for better force path, add node_5 approximately midpoint and slightly left for multiple load paths compensation. Use smaller areas on tension members, larger on major compressive ones. Remove inefficient or highly stressed members, form stable triangular patterns. Ensure no duplicate nodes/members, keep members under stress limits by length and cross-sectional area choice.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Nodes: node_1(0.0,0.0), node_2(6.0,0.0), node_3(2.0,0.0) unchanged; add node_4 at (3.5,2.8), node_5 at (4.6,1.5) to reduce asymmetric forces and create stable truss patterns with multiple triangular substructures. Members: form primary chords and braces with appropriately chosen cross-section areas to handle compressive/tensile forces under limits ±15. Use larger cross-section areas for longer compressive members and smaller areas for tension diagonals to control stress and mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Lower node_4 height reduces bending and moment arms. Node_5 added decreases member lengths sharing load from node_3 to node_2. Triangles formed (node_1-3-4), (node_3-4-5), (node_4-5-2), plus diagonals (node_3-5) and (node_1-4) provide force path dispersion. Assume basic analysis that short members, good triangulation and lower bending will reduce max stresses.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths > Calculate mass: length*area coefficient; limit sum mass<=30. Area choices restricted to discrete values {0:1,1:0.195,...}. Use areas 3 (1.759) or 2 (0.782) for major chords; lower areas like 1 (0.195) for tension diagonals. Massive members unnecessary.
