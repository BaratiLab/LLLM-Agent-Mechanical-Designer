  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under loads, supports given, to meet stress and mass limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3: magnitude 10N @ -45°. Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2 as fixed. Current peak stress 40.29 >> limit±15, mass 11.306 < 30 (okay). Stress governs. Member_2 (node_1 to node_4) excess tension. Need to lower max stress by reconfiguration/area assignment.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design: Triangular truss with diagonal cross links and height 3m at node_4. Overstressed member_2 indicating tension too high—maybe cross member too slender. Mass is light enough to allow area upsizing or node adjustment. Nodes for load/support fixed, can add intermediate nodes.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Candidate strategy: Increase cross bracing efficiency; add midpoint node vertically for height leverage; lower member_2 stress by load redistribution; resize member areas; avoid over-area increasing to keep <30 mass; consider removing redundant member_5 (directly connecting node_2 to node_3) if tense.",
  
  "proposal": "Add one new node (node_5) above node_4, at x=4.0, y=5.0 (increasing vertical lever arm); restructure 2 top chords: node_1->node_4->node_5 and node_2->node_4->node_5; remove member_5 and add members: node_3-node_5, node_4-node_5, node_3-node_4 retained. Area adjustments: Higher in tension links at 4, diagonal braces at 3 or 2, lower area at compressive members.",
  
  "reasoning": "By elevating a new node (node_5) higher than node_4, we gain larger moment arms to reduce tension forces in original diagonal member. Removing direct member_5 reduces complex load paths, simplifies stress distribution. Areas assigned to keep stresses below ±15 MPa eliminating overstress while mass kept in limit 30 by selective sizing. Resulting truss top chord formed with elevation smoothing loads.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Length computations: node_4 to node_5 vertical ~2m, enough for better bracing; areas: member_2 area 4 (3.128), increased from prior 1 (0.195), rest sized cross-check with length*area not exceeding mass. Use basic trigonometry to estimate member lengths.",
  
  "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_4: ~5.0 m, node_4-node_5: 2.0 m, node_1-node_3: 2.0 m, node_3-node_5: approx sqrt((2-4)^2 + (0-5)^2) = ~5.39m, node_2-node_4: ~3.6055 m, node_3-node_4: 3.6055m. Assign area_id: tension member_2 get area 4 (3.128), shorter diagonals area 2 (0.782), longer tensions areas 3 (1.759), compressive members area 1 (0.195). Approx mass estimation (sum length * area) < 30 after rough calcs.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no node or member duplication; supports fixed; maximum stress constrained by chosen areas; mass under prescribed limits optimized by geometry and resized members. Removal of member_5 reduces structural redundancy for better stress trade-offs. New elevated node for load redistribution.",
