Current design fails max stress constraint at member_8. Mass is okay. Load is -10 @45° downward left on node_3. Supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller fixed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current max stress 24.41 in member_8 (node_4-node_5) exceeds ±15 limit. This member area=1 (0.195) but producing large stress. Other members have smaller stress magnitudes. Total mass 24.368 < 30 is good. The heavy stress on member_8 suggests load path needs rearrangement to reduce this demand.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Removing or re-assigning member_8 to lighter section fails or stress worsens. Adding an intermediate node closer to node_3 might help split forces. Considering new node between nodes 4 and 5 to reduce member_8 length and add more bracing.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_6 at (3.0, 1.6) between node_4 and node_5, split member_8 into two shorter members node_4-node_6 and node_6-node_5 with smaller areas. Rearrange members and optimize area sizes to limit stress, increase support paths, reduce load concentration.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Intermediate node reduces long member under large bending/compression. Re-splitting member_8 into two members reduces stress in each. Optimize cross-sections in lower-stress members. Keeping nodes fixed where loads/supports applied and adding node where needed improves load distribution. Avoid large areas increasing mass. Choose moderate sections on main load force path and smaller sections elsewhere to keep mass under 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths and estimated forces for new configuration, check max stress ≤ 15.
