  "preamble": "Current truss meets constraints; stress minimized effectively.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Stress max 6.97 < 15, mass 25.24 < 30, load and support nodes fixed, closure maintained.",
  
  "analysis": "The max stress (6.97) is well below allowed ±15. Total mass (25.24) is under 30. Members with zero stress suggest efficient load paths. Node_6 displacement upwards improves force distribution, reducing max member stress notably from previous step with 27.19 max stress.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further moving internal nodes has limited gains as stresses are balanced; reducing mass further likely increases stress. All connectivity ensures a closed truss form without duplicates. Areas selected match usage and constraints.",
  
  "reasoning": "Stress and mass are well within limits and show marked improvement over past iterations. Areas for highest stress members are moderate (2 or 3), well tuned for strength and weight. Load at node_3 and supports locked at nodes 1 and 2. Adjusting node_6 position was key. Adding member_7 improved redundancy reducing stress without adding excess mass.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Verification: No member exceeds ±15 stress. Mass below max. No support/load node changes. No duplicates. All members connected between nodes per instructions. Closed loop maintained via members 1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10.",
  
  "calculation": "Members stresses range -6.96 to 6.0, safely below 15. Mass: sum members equals 25.24. Moving node_6 to (3.0,1.9) gave optimal stress distribution. Areas tuned with 2 or 3 to balance carried load and mass. Zero stresses on members 6 and 9 useful redundancy without mass penalty.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Appropriate tradeoff between low stress and mass, balanced redundant paths ensure robustness. Optimizing further by nodal moves or area changes leads to diminishing returns or risk violation. Criteria fully met.",
