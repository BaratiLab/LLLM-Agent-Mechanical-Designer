To form a closed 2D truss all nodes must connect in a polygon. Current nodes only lie on x-axis, no vertical height to resist moments and bending, so we must add at least one additional node above x-axis to form a triangle (closed truss). Without node reposition, new node(s) must be added. Adding one strategically placed node above node_3 would form a triangle with node_1 and node_2 and resist the load better. Members will be edges between nodes.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 above node_3 to break colinearity, create three members from new node to node_1, node_2, node_3, plus base members node_1 - node_3 and node_3 - node_2 for closure.

Optimize by using smaller cross-sections for tension if possible and slightly larger for critical compression members sharing load.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Load at node_3 angled -45° down-right induces compression in node_1-node_3 member if diagonals positioned well.
