Current stresses: member_1 exceeds compressive limit. Total mass just under 30kg but stress constraint violated. Aim: Reduce stress in member_1 by reconfiguring nodes or members with minimal impact on mass.",\n\n  "analysis": "Member_1 is oversized in stress (-17.08), exceeding -15 limit; also heavy mass in members_3 and 4 suggests inefficient distribution. The current top node_4 between node_1 and node_2 likely causes stress concentration at member_1 because of load transfer through node_3. Possible to add another node to redistribute forces or reposition node_4 slightly upward/right to reduce compressive force on member_1. Members lengths and cross-sectional areas can be adjusted accordingly.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Options: 1) Move node_4 slightly up and right to increase triangle height → reduce compressive force on member_1, 2) Add a node near node_3 to share load better, 3) Use smaller area for member_1 if possible because it\'s compressed heavily; area_1 (0.195) too small. Choose area for member_1 to meet stress limit by increasing it if required.",\n\n  "proposal": "Maintain existing load/support nodes. Modify node_4 coordinates from [2.0, 1.5] to approximately [2.2, 2.0] increasing height and shifting right. Add one node (node_5) at approximately [4.0, 1.5] to create a second upper joint sharing forces. Connect new members: member_6 between node_5 and node_2, member_7 between node_5 and node_3, and member_8 between node_4 and node_5. Remove member_4 as it\'s long and carries low stress. Use moderate areas selected from allowed sizes. Areas assigned to keep stresses within ±15 and masses total under 30 kg.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Increasing height redistributes load away from member_1 and node_3, reducing compressive peak in member_1. Adding node_5 connects right upper side distributing load path while reducing length of currents members under compression. Removing low-contribution member_4 cut down heavy mass. Assigning areas judiciously especially increasing area for highly stressed members reduces stress. Cross-check lengths and masses to ensure sum mass < 30 kg and stress in allowable range ±15.", \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculations using node locations, cross-sectional area IDs substituted from given areas dict: \'0\':1.0, \'1\':0.195,... \'10\':19.548.
