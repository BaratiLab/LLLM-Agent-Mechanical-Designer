Supports at node_1(pinned), node_2(roller). Constraints: max stress ±15, total mass ≤ 30. Existing design overshoots stress at member_10 (27.19) and mass (23.99) under limits, but stress violation is critical.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The excessive stress is mainly in member_10 from node_6 to node_2. This member is tensioned above limits. The node_6 position and connection generates a long high-stress member with area=2. Other tensions also overshoot limits in members from node_6 region.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Strategy: relocate node_6 to reduce length and re-triangulate members to distribute load better. Possibly increase area where high stresses occur within area set constraints, but mass limit must be maintained. Also consider removing or rerouting members causing peak stress member_10.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Modified 6-node truss with node_6 moved closer between nodes 4 and 5 to shorten high stress members. Member areas adjusted to keep mass under 30 and reduce max stress below 15. Introduce member from node_6 to node_3 to better stabilize force path and relieve outer tension member_10.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Relocated node_6 to (3.0, 1.9) reducing span to node_2 and node_5, enabling smaller required area. Added member 7 from node_6 to node_3 for load distribution. Areas chosen to keep mass low but provide capacity. Member length reductions directly decrease mass and increase stiffness, mitigating peak stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Area choices: keep critical high tension members at 3 (1.759 area) or reduce if shorter length; others at 2 (0.782).
