  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under load at node_3 with given supports and limit on stress ±15 and mass <= 30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Ensure max stress ≤ ±15 and total mass ≤ 30. Current design fails max stress constraint at member_8. Mass is okay. Load is -10 @45° downward left on node_3. Supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller fixed.",
  
  "analysis": "Current max stress 24.41 in member_8 (node_4-node_5) exceeds ±15 limit. This member area=1 (0.195) but producing large stress. Other members have smaller stress magnitudes. Total mass 24.368 < 30 is good. The heavy stress on member_8 suggests load path needs rearrangement to reduce this demand.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Removing or re-assigning member_8 to lighter section fails or stress worsens. Adding an intermediate node closer to node_3 might help split forces. Considering new node between nodes 4 and 5 to reduce member_8 length and add more bracing.",
  
  "proposal": "Add node_6 at (3.0, 1.6) between node_4 and node_5, split member_8 into two shorter members node_4-node_6 and node_6-node_5 with smaller areas. Rearrange members and optimize area sizes to limit stress, increase support paths, reduce load concentration.",
  
  "reasoning": "Intermediate node reduces long member under large bending/compression. Re-splitting member_8 into two members reduces stress in each. Optimize cross-sections in lower-stress members. Keeping nodes fixed where loads/supports applied and adding node where needed improves load distribution. Avoid large areas increasing mass. Choose moderate sections on main load force path and smaller sections elsewhere to keep mass under 30.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths and estimated forces for new configuration, check max stress ≤ 15. Use areas from '0':1 to '10':19.548 based on loads and length approx. Ensure total mass = ∑ length*area ≤ 30. Use smaller areas 0-3 on tension members, larger on compression if needed.",
  
  "calculation": "Node positions:\n- node_6 at (3.0,1.6).\nMembers:\n- Replace member_8 by member_8:node_4-node_6 area 1\n- member_9: node_6-node_5 area 1\nRe-check stress on these two with smaller lengths reduces maximum stress.\nKeep other members similar but tune down area where stress < limits to reduce mass.\nApproximate lengths and mass:\n- node_4-node_6 ≈ sqrt((3.0-2.2)^2+(1.6-2.0)^2)=~0.89\n- node_6-node_5≈ sqrt((4.0-3.0)^2+(1.5-1.6)^2)=~1.00\nTotal mass new for those 2 members area 1: (0.89+1)*0.195 = ~0.36 small addition.\nAdjust areas on members 1-3 in mid-range 2-4 to control stresses.\nTotal estimated mass planned approx ≤ 27, max stress within ±15 achievable.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New design to be tested for max stress ≤15, mass ≤30. Added one node to relieve critical member. Adjusted areas for good load flow and safety.",
