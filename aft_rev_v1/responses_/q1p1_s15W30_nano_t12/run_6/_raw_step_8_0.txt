Load at node_3, supports node_1 pinned, node_2 roller fixed.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Max compressive/tensile stress is well within ±15 constraint; mass has some margin. Highest compressive stress is ~-9.2 in member_5; tension max ~7.4 in member_1. To further lower stress, we look for better geometric force distribution via node_4 adjustment.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Nodal positions node_1,2,3 fixed due to boundary/load conditions. Move node_4 vertically/some horizontal for stress optimization; keep structure closed. Consider slightly raising node_4 y to reduce compressive in member_5 by creating more favorable force path.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Member_5 compression maxes out near -9.2, weakening it via smaller cross-section is risky; instead, geometry tweaked to reroute forces. Increasing height more than 3.75 yielded diminishing returns earlier; try minor increase to node_4 y=3.85 and small x increment towards midpoint between node_1 and node_3 (say x=2.73) to balance diagonals node_4-node_3 and node_1-node_4 stresses.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "By infinitesimal adjustment: node_4 from (2.7,3.75) to (2.73,3.85), member lengths and angles increment in favor of better load resolution on node_3. Areas kept same; mass impact minor but reduces peak tension/compression imbalances.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Member lengths updated and cross-section areas retained (2 for members with compression near -9, 3 for tension ~7). Mass estimated near 22.1, still within 30. Stresses assessed to improve from max 9.2 down to ~8.0 via geometry means.",\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Verifying area codes (3,2) for members 3,5 suffice given load, no intensifying areas to heavier values costly in mass.
