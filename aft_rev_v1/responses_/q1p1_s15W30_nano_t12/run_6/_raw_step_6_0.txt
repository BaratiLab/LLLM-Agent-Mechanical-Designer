Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. Node_4 movable, previous steps show reduction of max stress by adjusting node_4 position and areas. Current max stress is -13.69 on member_3, close to limit. Areas selected mostly at \'2\' and \'3\' yielding moderate mass and stress balance.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress at member_3 (-13.69) is close to constraint boundary. The members connected to node_4 and node_3 exhibit both tension and compression. Node_3 positioned at load and node_1,node_2 fixed limits expansion. Moving node_4 slightly upward or laterally closer to centerline between node_1 and node_2 may improve stress distribution. Member_3 is in compression, length 2m, currently area_id \'2\'. Possibly small increase in area or shifting node_4 position may reduce peak compressive stress, or redistribution of stiffness.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_4 moved from (2.5,3.3) to (2.7,3.5) was beneficial. Small further adjustments needed. Member_3 length ~2m (horizontal), under compression (-13.69). Members 1 and 5 connect node_4 to node_1 and node_3—adjusting node_4 affects their axial forces. Consider raising node_4 slightly toward the vertical to balance compression in member_3. Mass currently 19.4<30 so we can consider minor area increases.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing node_4\'s y coordinate will increase member_1 and member_5 length, potentially redistributing forces to reduce member_3 compressive stress. Slightly increasing area of member_3 from \'2\'(0.782) to \'3\'(1.759) will reduce stress by increasing axial capacity but increase mass; however, mass budget allows this. Meanwhile, areas for members mostly at \'2\' and \'3\' are efficient. Try next node_4 around (2.7,3.7). For minimal mass increase keep other members\' areas same, upgrade member_3 area to \'3\'.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Length calculation: member_3 is node_1(0,0) to node_3(2,0)=2m fixed. Member 3 stress = Force/Area; increasing area reduces stress. Node_4 to nodes affect other members. Load fixed at node_3 causing compression in member_3. Increase node_4.y to shift load path upward, increasing jracking area for member_3 and keeping mass low.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Set new node_4 = (2.7, 3.7). Member_3 area_id increased to \'3\' from \'2\'. Estimates: member_3 stress reduce from -13.69 by nearly half due to nearly doubled area, member_1 and 5 stress may slightly increase due to length increase but expected balance. Total mass recalculated approximated: member_3 mass roughly doubles; old mass 1.564, new ~3.1, total from old 19.4 to ~21. If stress reduction sufficient, it\'s a step forward.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no viol of max stress ±15 and mass < 30, no nodes at load/support moved, areas in allowed set, no duplicate connections, structure closed.
