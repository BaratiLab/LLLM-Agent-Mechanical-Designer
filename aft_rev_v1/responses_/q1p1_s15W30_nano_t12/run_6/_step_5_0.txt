  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective is to reduce max stress (currently 13.61 < 15) and total mass (23.05 < 30). " 
                   "Load/support nodes fixed. Only node_4 moves. "
                   "Maintain 5 members forming closed truss.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_1 stress (-13.61) is max in compression; reducing its length or load influence should reduce stress. "
              "Member_3 and member_4 areas set to '3' (area=1.759) sufficient but could optimize slightly. "
              "Current node_4 Y=3.3; compared to last iteration at 3.1 and 4.0, shorter member_1 correlates "
              "with reducing stress on member_1. Increasing height moderately may reduce compressive stress in bottom members by sharing forces better. " 
              "Areas currently: member_1,2,5 at '2'(0.782), member_3,4 at '3'(1.759). Areas look reasonable mass/stress wise.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Testing node_4 slight shift upward and more to the right e.g. (2.7,3.5) might better align loading path. "
                  "Watch effect on member_5 which is diagonal from node_4 to node_3. "
                  "Check total mass and max stress limits. ",
  
  "reasoning": "Since no new nodes allowed, focus on node_4 moves to redistribute stresses. " 
               "Increasing node_4 y-coordinate often helps reduce bottom chord compression stress. "
               "Slight x-move could balance tension-compression across members. " 
               "Keep current area assignments, no change to avoid excess mass increase. "
               "Length increase minimal so total mass will stay under max. Optimal near iteration_4 positions.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Driver: min compression in member_1 from -13.6 closer to 0, keeping others below +/-15. " 
                  "Calculate length changes: current member_1 length = distance(0,0)-(2,0)=2m linear now shifted likely ~2.45m "
                  "New positions x=2.7,y=3.5 yields longer length but load path reduced compression likely. " 
                  "Area 0.782 fixed, force redistribution expected. ",

  "calculation": "Proposed node_4 = (2.7, 3.5) from (2.5, 3.3); small y increase 0.2, x +0.2. "
                 "Expected length(member_1) increases slightly from ~3.3 to sqrt((2.7)^2+3.5^2)=~4.44 m, recalculated: member_1 connects node_1 to node_4 -> from (0,0) to (2.7,3.5). "
                 "Added length may increase mass a little (mass = length Ã— area), acceptable within limit. "
                 "Other member lengths change similarly, expected to lower max stress from 13.61 to below 13. "
                 "Total mass approx after length and no area changes should remain under 24 safely under 30 limit.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Adjusting node_4 position within 0.2 units expected to reduce max stress further while respecting mass and stress limits. "
                       "No change in members or areas keeps complexity low. If max stress reduces below ~13 with mass <30, continue optimization or stop next iteration.",
