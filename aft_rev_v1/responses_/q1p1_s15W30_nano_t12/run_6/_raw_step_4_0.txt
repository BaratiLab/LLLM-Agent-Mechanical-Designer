The node_4 moved down to (2.7,3.1) reduced mass to 22.37 from 25.5 but stress rose from 13.56 to 14.29 indicating potential imbalance. Insight: shorten or adjust member_1 length by shifting node_4 horizontally to reduce compression in member_1 while maintaining triangle geometry.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 is highly stressed in compression. Increasing height helped but needs refinement. Decreasing x-distance between node_4 and node_1 can reduce lever arm and compressive force in member_1. Mass safety margin available to increase area in high stress members, but optimization prefers geometric tuning first.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Node 4 should be shifted slightly leftwards and upwards to balance stresses better in members 1 and 5. Maintain closed 2D truss triangular geometry with members 3,4 upper chord and bottom chords 1,2,5. Keep node_3 at (2.0, 0.0) fixed due to load. Supports fixed.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_4=(2.7,3.1), try new node_4 around (2.5, 3.3) to reduce compression in member_1, maintain structural integrity. Approximate member lengths and estimate stress impact: shorter member_1 reduces stress, slight vertical increase raises compression capacity. Re-check mass from members length × area_id direct assignment - no area change this iteration to avoid mass increase.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Updated node_4 to (2.5, 3.3), recalc member lengths: member_1 length reduces from ~3.3 to ~3.0, member_5 length slightly increases - neutral or beneficial to stress.
