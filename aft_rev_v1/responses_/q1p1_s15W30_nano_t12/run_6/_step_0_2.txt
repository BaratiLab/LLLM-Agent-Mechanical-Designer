  "preamble": "Optimize closed 2D truss with 3 fixed nodes, external load on node_3, minimizing stress within ±15 and mass ≤ 30 using limited areas.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes at x-axis, load downward right at node_3. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Need closed truss (all nodes connected) with low stress and mass within limits.",
  
  "analysis": "Three nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0) are collinear, so to form a closed truss must add at least one non-collinear node. Only using the given nodes would create a single line, not closed. Adding node_4 above nodes for triangulation is best. Load at node_3 is -10 in -45° (down/right), need to transfer vertical and horizontal supporting reactions to pinned and roller. Maximum allowed stress ±15, so cross-section areas chosen accordingly.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Idea: Add node_4 above node_3 (2, y) around y=4 for a stiff triangle. Members connecting node_4 to node_1, node_2, node_3. This creates two triangles (one with node_1 & node_4 & node_3, one with node_3, node_4 & node_2), closed truss with 4 nodes.",
  
  "reasoning": "With the new node at (2,4) forming triangles, the truss can distribute load through multiple members. Use equilibrium to find member forces. Assess length, pick small but adequate area to keep stress ≤ 15. Use linear approximation for member force, stress = force/area. Mass is sum of length * area per member. Iterate area choices to keep mass ≤ 30. ",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Truss only axial forces, statics equilibrium, E ignored (stiffness not detailed). Members: node_1-4, node_4-2, node_4-3, node_1-3, node_3-2. Load magnitude: 10 units at node_3 at -45° meaning approx Fx ≈ 7.07 right, Fy ≈ -7.07 downward. Reactions calculated at supports. Use areas from table mapped to stress + mass limits.",
