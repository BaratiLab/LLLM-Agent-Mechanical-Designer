Mass 25.5 under limit. Load on node_3 fixed; supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed, so only node_4 can be moved. Currently, node_4 is at (3.0,4.0), contributing high stress on member_1 (-13.56) and member_5 (-9.32). Members with area_ids 2 and 3 ensure feasible mass. We can attempt to reduce stress by adjusting node_4\'s vertical position moderately to balance member forces, optimizing geometry under constraints.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Moving node_4 from (3.0,4.0) to a lower height maybe reduces compression in member_1, which is highly stressed. Possibly shortening member_3 and member_4 slightly relieves stress. Keep node_4 horizontally close to midpoint between node_1 and node_2 to maintain triangulation.",\n\n  "reasoning": "High compressive stress in member_1 connected to node_1 and node_3 suggests node_4\'s placement induces large force transfer. Lowering node_4 towards node_3 horizontally and reducing its y-coordinate can decrease member_1 axial force. However, lowering too much decreases triangulation effect. I keep node_3 fixed at (2.0, 0.0), node_4 adjusted slightly left and down from current position. Area assignments kept unchanged since within allowed mass.
