  "preamble": "Optimize node 4 position to reduce max stress while staying within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Target max stress < ±15, total mass < 30, preserve load/support nodes, adjust only node_4 position within the current 4-node truss constrained layout.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is close to limit at 14.29 (member_1 compression). The node_4 moved down to (2.7,3.1) reduced mass to 22.37 from 25.5 but stress rose from 13.56 to 14.29 indicating potential imbalance. Insight: shorten or adjust member_1 length by shifting node_4 horizontally to reduce compression in member_1 while maintaining triangle geometry.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 is highly stressed in compression. Increasing height helped but needs refinement. Decreasing x-distance between node_4 and node_1 can reduce lever arm and compressive force in member_1. Mass safety margin available to increase area in high stress members, but optimization prefers geometric tuning first.",
  
  "reasoning": "Node 4 should be shifted slightly leftwards and upwards to balance stresses better in members 1 and 5. Maintain closed 2D truss triangular geometry with members 3,4 upper chord and bottom chords 1,2,5. Keep node_3 at (2.0, 0.0) fixed due to load. Supports fixed.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_4=(2.7,3.1), try new node_4 around (2.5, 3.3) to reduce compression in member_1, maintain structural integrity. Approximate member lengths and estimate stress impact: shorter member_1 reduces stress, slight vertical increase raises compression capacity. Re-check mass from members length × area_id direct assignment - no area change this iteration to avoid mass increase.",
  
  "calculation": "Updated node_4 to (2.5, 3.3), recalc member lengths: member_1 length reduces from ~3.3 to ~3.0, member_5 length slightly increases - neutral or beneficial to stress. Total mass ~22 still <30, expect max stress reduction to ~13.5-14.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Resulting structure maintains constraints, anticipates stress improvement below 14.29, no area changes to reduce mass given margin. Further node moves should reduce max stress for next iteration.",
