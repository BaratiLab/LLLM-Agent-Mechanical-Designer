Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Need closed truss (all nodes connected) with low stress and mass within limits.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Three nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0) are collinear, so to form a closed truss must add at least one non-collinear node. Only using the given nodes would create a single line, not closed. Adding node_4 above nodes for triangulation is best. Load at node_3 is -10 in -45° (down/right), need to transfer vertical and horizontal supporting reactions to pinned and roller. Maximum allowed stress ±15, so cross-section areas chosen accordingly.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Idea: Add node_4 above node_3 (2, y) around y=4 for a stiff triangle. Members connecting node_4 to node_1, node_2, node_3. This creates two triangles (one with node_1 & node_4 & node_3, one with node_3, node_4 & node_2), closed truss with 4 nodes.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "With the new node at (2,4) forming triangles, the truss can distribute load through multiple members. Use equilibrium to find member forces. Assess length, pick small but adequate area to keep stress ≤ 15. Use linear approximation for member force, stress = force/area. Mass is sum of length * area per member. Iterate area choices to keep mass ≤ 30.
