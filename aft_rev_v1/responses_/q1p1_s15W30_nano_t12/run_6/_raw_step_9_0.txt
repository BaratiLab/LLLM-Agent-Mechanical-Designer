Last iteration max stress 9.2 below limit, mass 22.29 below limit. Node_4 adjusted upwards over iterations to reduce stress.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Load is at node_3; nodes_1 and _2 fixed supports. Current node_4 position near optimal compromise for lower stress in members. Members with areas 2 or 3 yielding stresses well within ±15. Mass is consistently under 30. No existing node positions changed except node_4 to adjust stress distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further raising node_4 might induce higher stress; small adjustments not reducing max stress noticeably after iteration 6-8. Member areas are appropriate given relative stress magnitudes. Alternative member connectivity considered previously was either higher mass or stress spikes.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "The truss shape and member sizing follow classical triangulation pattern minimizing bending stress under point load at mid span. Maximally unloaded members have lower area. Changing node_4 position beyond current (2.73,3.85) risks imbalance and higher peak stress. Load and supports fixed; only free node moved. Mass under limits allowing stress minimization priority. Current max absolute stress 9.2 significantly below ±15, no further reduction strongly evident.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Evaluated history: stresses stabilized after steady decrease, mass stable ~22-23. Stress magnitude also stabilized within margins. Members sized in an ascending order from least stressed to most stressed. Attempted adding nodes past iteration_1 was too heavy. Continuing iterations unlikely to provide meaningful improvement.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Current nodes handshake structure with truss lengths and member sizes: member_1 and member_5 are highest stressed compression; both sized area \'2\'. member_3 tension manageable with area \'3\'. Total mass at 22.2863 well below 30 constraint, allowing stress safety margin. No current member approaches size constraint nor stress limit. Minimal movement would perturb equilibrium worse than improve it. ",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Adhering to constraints(best mass and max stress angle). Members from areas set confirm stress within range. Node_4 is the only free, optimized coordinate. Final stress and mass RMS stable.
