Objective is to minimize stress further by optimizing node4 position and areas.",\n  "analysis": "Member_3 area was increased from 2 to 3, reducing its negative stress from -13.69 to -5.97. Lower stress now overall. Node 4 moved slightly upward to 3.7 to reduce stress. Mass remains below limit. Max stress is spread more evenly. Current design shows leverage from moving node4 and increasing member_3 area. Still stress on member_5 is around -9.2 and member_1 around 7.46 suggests potential functional optimization with node 4 repositioning and area tweaking.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Possible to iterate on node_4 vertical position and member areas 2 or 3 to balance load paths, especially members 1,3 and 5. Avoid mass increase beyond 30. Consider a slight shift in x or y coordinates of node 4 to change force distributions while keeping load/support nodes fixed.",\n  "reasoning": "To minimize the max stress further, increasing the vertical height of node_4 slightly redistributes forces favorably, reducing compression peak on member_3 and tension on member_1. Member_3 area is beneficial at 3 (1.759) balancing stress reduction with mass. Moving node_4 upward further may increase mass or stresses on members 4 or 5, so needs to be small consistent steps. Keeping member_1 and 5 at area 2 avoids overmass. Node 4 x-position is already between nodes 1 and 2 reasonably.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: member_1 and member_3 depend on node_4 coordinates, slightly adjusting y of node_4 affects their length and stresses. Areas: member_1 and member_3 area 2 and 3 used respectively, member_5 area 2 still. Max stress max abs ~9.2 well within max allowable 15\\nMass: Total 21.8934 < 30, margin for slight area increase on sought members.",\n  "calculation": "Try shifting node_4 up by 0.1 to 3.8 and down by 0.1 to 3.6 for stress impact. Outstanding high stress members: #3 (-5.97), #1 (7.46), #5 (-9.2). Consider trial decrease in member_1 area from 2->1 may increase stress but maybe reducing member_5 to area 1 too high stress. Leave member_3 area 3 for reducing highest compression. Increment node_4 position in y; keep areas member_1 and 5 at area 2 and member_3 area 3.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met with margin in max stress and total mass. Small increase in node_4 y to 3.75 better redistributes stress. Lowering member_1 area to 1 increases high stress on member_1, so not ideal.
