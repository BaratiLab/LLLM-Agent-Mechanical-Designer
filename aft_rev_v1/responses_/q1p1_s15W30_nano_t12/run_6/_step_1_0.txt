  "preamble": "Redesign truss to satisfy stress ≤ ±15 and mass ≤ 30 under given load and supports.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load -10N, -45° on node_3; supports pinned node_1 & roller node_2. Current max stress too high (-48.35), mass acceptable (12.2). Areas too small on members with high compression; stress far exceeded compressive limit.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design over-stressed member_1 (-48.35 vs max allowed 15). Members near load carry high stress, area insufficient. Nodes at base fixed; node_3 on baseline already loaded. Need to better triangulate and distribute loads, increase critical member areas, and possibly restructure node layout to reduce compressive stresses.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Moving node_4 upwards and right could reduce force concentration. Add diagonal bracing for stability. Increase areas on highly stressed members. Keep node_3 fixed on baseline (6m span), consider moving node_4 upward (for longer diagonal supports). Increase node density triangular shape to distribute force.",
  
  "proposal": "Add an additional node between node_3 and node_4 upward to form two diagonal braces, shift node_4 up to 5.5m vertical distance. Members: from node_1 to node_4, node_4 to node_2, node_3 to new node_5, and node_5 to node_4 and node_2 for better triangulation. Increase area selection for highly stressed members primarily 'member_1'. Areas picked from available discrete set, balance to meet mass constraint.",
  
  "reasoning": "Increase height of node_4 extends the diagonal supporting members, reducing stress in members between node_1 and node_3 due to better load redirection. Additional node adds two members converting square elements to triangles, increases rigidity and redistributes loads. Select area IDs 4 (3.128) and 3 (1.759) for moderate member masses with improved capacity. Keep smallest areas for less stressed top chord to reduce weight. Check total mass staying below 30.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculations: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2,5.5) new, node_5 avg x between 2 and 4 at y=2.0 about (3,2). Member lengths calculated from vertical and horizontal teorems Pythagorean. Carefully pick areas: high stress compressive members area >= 4. Low stress diagonals can be 2 or 1 to save mass. Total length times area ≤ total mass 30.",
  
  "calculation": "member_1: node_1->node_3 length=2m; increasing area to id4(~3.128) stress reduction expected. member_3: node_1->node_4 length=√((2-0)^2 + (5.5-0)^2) ≈5.85m area 3(1.759) reduce stress. New member_6 node_3->node_5 ~ √((3-2)^2 + (2-0)^2) =~2.23m. A=2 ~0.782. member_7 and member_8 crossing diagonals will further absorb load and offer redundancy. Sum masses approximately: (2*3.128)+(5.85*1.759)+(other members with smaller areas) is under 30.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Check maximum stress expected reducing significantly below 15 due to increased area & tweaked geometry; mass in range. Supports not altered and loading same. Should satisfy both constraints.",
