  "preamble": "Optimization at iteration 5: stress is low, constraints satisfied.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max compressive/tensile stress ~6.38 < 15; mass 27.35 < 30; load at node_3; supports fixed.",
  "analysis": "Current truss has low max stress safely within limits and mass below max. Node_6 replaces previous node_5, reducing max stress significantly. Member areas all reasonable. No nodes at load/support moved.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress ranges from -6.38 to +3.71, far under constrain limit ±15. Mass margin ~2.6 available but member areas large enough to ensure low stress.",
  "reasoning": "Further moving intermediate node_6 to improve generic stress distribution gives minimal gains. Member areas are used favorably: areas 2 and 3 selected appropriately for load and length. Adding more members or nodes not warranted due to closed truss and low stresses.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Previous iterations reduced stress from above 15 to ~6.38 by repositioning node_6 near node_4 and moderate cross section areas (3 and 2). With each move, stress decreased steadily. Mass is still below max limit with comfortable margin. No significant compressive or tensile members close to leverage limit.",
  "calculation": "Length and area combination yields current member masses with expected member length times area factor within max allowed total mass. Max stresses safely below ±15 N/mm^2. Load distribution effectively handled with current structure. Further node or area alterations risk violating constraints or unnecessary mass increase.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Satisfied constraints with acceptable safety margin. Optimization seems converged with balanced node positioning and member sizing. Concentrating stress below 7 MPa ensures durability. Mass of 27.35 under 30 allows slight variation but not beneficial currently.",
