Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Current max stressExceeded (39.52 > 15), mass okay (24.8 < 30). We need a design with better stress distribution and possibly redistribute members/support assumptions. We have freedom to add/move internal nodes but not support/load nodes.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current max stress on member_5 (-)39.52 far exceeds allowable ±15. Areas: member_5 reduced from 2 to 1 in last iteration but caused too high stress (compression max here). Members 6 and 7 are almost unstressed; removing/reassigning could help. Node_5 position changed but ineffective. Member 5 connects node_3 to node_4 (3.3,3). Their vertical component is ~3 giving high axial compression in member_5 with small area. Current large area members 3 and 4 not helped much with max stress in compressive region on member_5. Total mass < 30 so feasible to increase area elsewhere. Strategic reinforcement to reduce stress in high-load member (member_5) or redistribute load by better triangulation could help. The load at node_3 (-10 at -45°) requires solid bracing around node_3, focusing on tension/compression balanced paths.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Prior focus on lowering member_5 area rushed stress beyond criteria leading to failure. Adding a new node closer to load for better force path, using stronger members near node_3 to reduce overloaded member 5. Remove/reduce areas of underutilized members to balance mass.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Add one new node in vertical load path between node_3 and node_4 at optimized location (say node_6 near (2.9, 2.3)) to subdivide long member_5. Redefine members to: connect node_3 to node_6 and node_6 to node_4 with balanced areas. Keep members_1 and _2 small areas, reduce load path on member_5 disaggregating load to alleviate the main compressive stress. Use moderate area that meets mass limit. Remove members_6 and _7 (both near zero stress). Increase area on new members where needed. Member connections: member_1: (node_1-node_3), member_2: (node_3-node_2), member_3: (node_1-node_4), member_4: (node_2-node_4), member_5: (node_3-node_6), member_6: (node_6-node_4).",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Splitting the high compression member into two reduces length and stress, avoiding extreme stress magnitude in one member. Introducing a new node redistributes forces better over the structure. Eliminating very lightly loaded members (6,7) saves mass for increased areas where necessary. Areas assigned to low values on longer members not critical (member_1, member_2), higher values on members near node_4 and node_6. Member stress limit ±15 means keep member areas large enough to reduce stress below limit, mass budget 30 allows this. Node positions chosen to keep good triangulation geometry suiting load path and carryables supports.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_3-node_6 ~ sqrt((2.9-2)^2+(2.3-0)^2)=approx 2.427; node_6-node_4 ~ sqrt((3.3-2.9)^2+(3-2.3)^2) ~ 0.806. Assign areas: area=3 for node_3-node_6, area=3 for node_6-node_4 to ensure both can carry their share of load and reduce stress. Decrease small members accordingly with area 1 or 2. Calculate estimated max stress approx = Force / (Area × cross-section factor × length), kept within ±15. Mass estimation sums over member length × area coefficients: keep less than 30.
