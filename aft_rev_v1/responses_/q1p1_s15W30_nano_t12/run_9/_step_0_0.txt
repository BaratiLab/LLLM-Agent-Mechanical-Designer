  "preamble": "Optimize truss with three fixed nodes under load minimizing stress and mass, ensuring closure and constraints.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes: node_1(0,0,pinned), node_2(6,0,roller), node_3(2,0) with downward-left load at node_3. Task: closed truss, stress |15| max, mass ≤ 30 from member length × area (area indexed). Single iteration optimization.",
  
  "analysis": "Given only 3 nodes along x-axis, loading on node_3 downward-left creates bending. To ensure truss closure and stiffness, add nodes above to form triangular geometry minimizing bending and stress. Nodes on y>0 will allow better axial force distribution. Place node_4 near (2.75, 2.5) to allow equilateral-like triangles with good stress paths. Connect members to form triangles: edges (1-3,3-2,1-4,2-4,3-4). Area assignments chosen from provided discrete values to meet stress (<=15) and mass (<=30). Use equilibrium approx - forces in members resist load via tension/compression. Area assigned proportional to force estimated by geometry. Use approximate axial stress σ=F/A, mass = Σ length_i × area_i.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member candidates and lengths with approx forces needed. Start from smaller areas for lesser length members to keep mass low; bigger areas for longer members under compression.\nLengths:\n-1-3=2.0\n-2-3=4.0\n-1-4~3.2\n-2-4~3.2\n-3-4~2.7\nArea choice approximate: 4.887 (ID 5) for longer heavily loaded; 0.782 (ID 2) or 1.759 (ID3) for shorter members\nEstimate stress using vertical load -10N at 45° into member force components.\nFinal mass check <30.\n",
  
  "reasoning": "Load at node_3 is -10N at -45°, approx vertical and horizontal components ~7.07N downward and 7.07N left.\nPinned and roller supports allow horizontal and vertical reactions.\nFocus on axial load distribution by members treating members as axial members only.\nDetermine load paths from load node_3 to supports node_1 and node_2.\nUse triangulated configuration to convert bending to axial forces. Member 1-3 and 2-3 carry load transfer; 4 helps stiffness and force distribution.\nTake assumed force in members as force equilibrium calculated approx.\nSize members with area corresponding to stress allowed. Stress = Force/(Area).\nPick larger cross-section members under tension/compression expected to be highest (close to load paths at node 3).\nEstimate total member lengths × areas to remain under 30 for mass.\n",
