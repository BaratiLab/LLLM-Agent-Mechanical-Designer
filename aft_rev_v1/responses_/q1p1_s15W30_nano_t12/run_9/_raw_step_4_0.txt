Aim to reduce highest compressive -9.85 (member_5) and balance member areas for minimum stress.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Highest stress magnitude is on member_5 (-9.8548), connecting node_3 to node_4, area 2 (0.782). Members 6 and 7 have zero stress with smallest areas (1, 0.195). The load node_3 (fixed) and supports locked are constant. Non-support/load nodes node_4 and node_5 can be repositioned. Increasing node_5\'s vertical coordinate can orient members 6 and 7 to carry some forces, reducing stress in main members. Member_5 area can be adjusted. Tradeoff area/member length affects mass and stress. Enlargement of node_5 height may improve force distribution. Avoid exceeding area index 3 given mass limit. Area 4 or above may increase mass dramatically.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try raising node_5 from (2.6,1.5) to near (2.6,1.8-2.0) to increase its leverage, expect members 6 and 7 to see more stress, reducing load on member_5. Possibly reduce member_5 area to 1 or keep at 2 depending on stress outcome. Consider increasing member_6 and 7 area if stressed. Keep areas balanced so mass remains < 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Elevating node_5 will convert the triangle of (3, 4, 5) into a more equilateral shape, enhancing the truss\'s capacity to distribute forces. The zero stress on members 6 and 7 currently indicates underused capacity. Assign some tension/compression to them by node repositioning. This might shift load from member_5, reducing its stress. Reduce member_5 area if its stress is lowered, mass goes down, further safety margin gained. Areas for members attached to supports/loaded nodes need to remain stable so no destabilization occurs.
