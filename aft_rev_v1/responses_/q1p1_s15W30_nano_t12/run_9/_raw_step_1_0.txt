Total mass limit is 30, current mass 15.4 well below limit. Load at node_3, supports at node_1(pinned) and node_2(roller).",\n\n  "analysis": "Current design nearly meets mass limits but max compressive stress at member_1 (-15.67) slightly exceeds allowed ±15. This indicates high compressive load on member_1 between node_1 and node_3 causing failure. Geometry concentrates stress here due to short horizontal bottom chord. Member_5 (diagonal) has larger area = 3, signifying load transfer to diagonal but still insufficient.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Options: add an extra node to reduce stress at node_3 area; change member areas; reconfigure diagonals for better stress distribution. Keeping supports/nodes_1,2,3 fixed; node_4 can be repositioned to optimize load path and reduce max compressive stress.",\n\n  "proposal": "Adjust node_4 coordinate upward and slightly shift horizontally to spread forces. Slightly reduce area of highly stressed member_1 and adjust areas of members around node_3 to redistribute load. Add member between node_1 and node_2 to form a better stable truss base and reduce bottom chord stress. Areas selected from provided set and rebalanced for less over-stress. Node_1 and node_2 stay at x=0,0; x=6,0; node_3 stays at 2,0; node_4 repositioned at approx (3.1, 2.7) to form larger triangle for load.)",\n\n  "reasoning": "Max compressive stress caused by short length and loading path in member_1. Increasing vertical height at node_4 enlarges diagonal moment arm and reduces load in horizontal members. Adding bottom chord member_6 (node_1 to node_2) improves structural redundancy and shares axial forces. Area ids reduced on member_1 to reduce mass while maintaining strength, increased on diagonals to allow good shear transfer.
