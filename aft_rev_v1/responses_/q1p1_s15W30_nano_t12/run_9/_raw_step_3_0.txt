Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Constraint max stress ±15MPa and total mass ≤30. Current max stress site is member_1 (-16.58MPa) exceeding tensile limit by 1.58 MPa. Current total mass 22.78 is under limit. Need to reduce stress in member_1 without increasing mass significantly. Node_4 is existing apex at (3.0, 2.4).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_1 (node_1-node_3) carries excessive compression (-16.58MPa). Increase member_1 area not preferable as it increases mass and stress surpasses limit. Alternatively, change topology to reduce member_1 load or redistribute forces by adjusting apex node and adding a diagonal. Currently no diagonal between supports and node_3 to better distribute load. Reposition node_4 slightly upward and shift along x to relieve member_1.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Eliminate excessive compression in member_1 by raising node_4. Add or strengthen truss members to improve force path from load node 3 to supports 1 and 2. Consider adding node_5 between nodes 3 and 4 for better APC. Areas assigned to minimize mass and control stress.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep supports and load nodes fixed at given positions. Move node_4 up and right to (3.3, 3.0) to enhance geometry and force distribution. Add new intermediate node_5 at (2.6,1.5). Add member between node_5 and nodes 3 and 4. Revise cross-section areas assigning smallest for web members and larger for chords under tension/compression. Remove previously oversized members and assign optimal area from allowed set. Do not add member_6 (between node_1 and node_2) as it increased stress before.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Raising node_4 increases truss height reducing forces on bottom chord member_1. Adding node_5 provides a second load path to reduce member_1 stress. Cross sections of members near high stress will be adjusted upward within allowed area codes to 3 or 4 to mitigate stresses but avoid unnecessary mass increment. New topology improves load transmission with longer members of optimized section. This approach balances mass and stress limits.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Existing members: member_1 (1-3), member_2(3-2), member_3(1-4), member_4(2-4), member_5(3-4).

Additional members(3-5): length≈√((2.6-2)²+(1.5-0)²)=1.56 m, area=1(0.195), mass=0.30. member_7(4-5): distance=√((3.3-2.6)²+(3.0-1.5)²)=1.68 m, area=1(0.195), mass=0.33.
