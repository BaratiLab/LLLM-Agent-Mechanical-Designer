  "preamble": "Current structure at iteration 7 meets all constraints with minimal stresses.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives: Minimize stress <= ±15; Mass ≤ 30. Current max stress 9.41; mass 16.65 within limits.",
  "analysis": "The structure is statically sound with stresses significantly below allowable limits, and mass is well under the max allowed. Intermediate nodes finely placed ensuring load transfer. The close calibration of member areas matched to stresses shows efficient sizing.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Attempted minor nodal shifts and area tweaks in past iterations yielded either stress spikes or negligible improvements. Current distribution balances compressive and tensile forces effectively.",
  "reasoning": "Further movement of internal nodes limited by complexity and presence of load/support nodes fixed. The existing member connectivity forms a stable frame that minimizes stress without exceeding mass. Areas of 1, 2, 3 have been used rationally to ensure capacity with minimal mass.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress examination across members shows margin to max allowable ±15. Reducing member 5 area or shifting nodes to reduce zero/stressless members could increase instability. Optimization gain minimal given current optimized mass and stress.",
  "calculation": "Total mass: 16.65 < 30; max stress: 9.41 < 15. Members with 0 stress are non-critical or low force—optimal trimming was done. All nodal positions fixed on supports/loads. Node positions adjusted progressively in previous iterations, no better stress reduction achievable without constraint violations.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verified constraints met, examined history for refinement attempts, concluded no meaningful further optimization possible under input limitations. Stop optimization.",
