Current max stress member_5 (36.179) and member_7 (−17.972) exceed compressive and tensile limits. Current total mass (~18) is within limit. Loads at node_3 downward-left (-10, -45°). Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Critical: better force distribution on members around node_6 and node_3 by altering node_6 position and member cross-sections, and adding one extra node to improve force paths.",\n\n    "analysis": "Looking at iteration_4, significant over-stress on member_5 & member_7 suggests these members are heavily loaded. Member_5 connects node_6 to node_4 (area 1), member_7 connects node_3 to node_6 (area 2). Load applied at node_3 introduces combined bending and axial stresses. Adding a new intermediate node between node_3 and node_6 may redistribute forces. Increasing area on highly stressed members (member_5) or changing connectivity can also help. Remove member_8 to reduce potential redundancy and unnecessary mass. Use node heights to create better triangulation and shorter compression members.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Introduce node_8 near node_3 and node_6 to split the force path and reduce member_5 and member_7 stresses; adjust cross-section areas carefully. Keep existing supports and load nodes fixed by instruction. Adjust node_6 location slightly higher/laterally. Remove or reduce members with near-zero or tensile failure to reduce mass. Use areas from available discrete set balancing mass/stress.",\n\n    "proposal": "Add node_8 at (2.6, 2.5) between nodes 3 and 6. Move node_6 to (3.4, 4.2) for improved geometry. Remove member_8 (\'node_1\' to \'node_6\') to reduce redundancy and mass. Connect node_3 to node_8 and node_8 to node_6. Use smaller area for members near tension/compression limits, larger area for critical high stress compression (member_5). Select areas with fine gradation, mostly area \'2\' (0.782) or \'3\' (1.759) to balance strength and mass. Maintain main load-support paths: node_1 to node_3, node_2 to node_7 and node_6.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Re-routing force flow using an intermediary node (node_8) reduces stress concentration by distributing tension/compression more evenly. Moving node_6 upwards increases member angles, reducing axial stress in some members, lowering compression stress in member_5. Removing member_8 eliminates unnecessary path, reducing mass and complexity. Retaining pinned and roller supports ensures statical determinacy and stability. Discrete area sizes ensure manufacturable members. Strategy aligned with truss design principles to maintain triangulated stable framework that controls stress and leverages geometric advantage for load paths.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Nodes: node_1(0.0, 0.0), node_2(6.0,0.0), node_3(2.0,0.0), node_4(2.0,3.0), node_6(3.4,4.2), node_7(4.0,3.5), node_8(2.6,2.5).
