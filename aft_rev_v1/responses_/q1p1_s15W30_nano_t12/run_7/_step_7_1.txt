  "preamble": "Optimize truss with given nodes and loading to meet stress and mass constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load: -10N at node_3 angled -45°, supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Max stress ±15, mass ≤ 30. Current max stress violations mainly on member_3 (53.06), and member_5 (-16.6). Mass 25.18 below max mass.",
  
  "analysis": "Current structure uses nodes concentrated mostly around nodes_1 to 9. Stress over limit mainly on member_3 (node_4-node_7) in tension and member_5 (node_1-node_7) in compression. Support 7 uses area '3' (3.128) for heavy compression stress: change needed. Triangulation near load node_3 could be improved to redistribute forces and reduce over-stress. Additional/repositioned node between node_4 and node_7 can help shorten stressed member, introduce better force path.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Removing or downgrading oversized members (like member_5), enable load sharing via intermediate nodes. Introduce new node (call it node_10) near upper center (say ~3.0 to 3.0) to refine geometry. Replace large area members with optimized smaller areas as stress allows. Use tension-only ties and compression-based struts judiciously. Member_7 highly compressed at -30.6 with lowest area '1' (0.195), consider upgrading or geometry change.",
  
  "proposal": "Add new node_10 at (3.0,3.1). Connect node_4 to node_10 and node_10 to node_7 with area '2'. Remove member_5 (node_1-node_7) - large compression, replace with node_1-node_10 with smaller area '1'. Retain node_8 and node_9 but remove member_7 (node_8-node_9) due to large compression with minimal area; create new members node_3-node_10 (area '2') and node_10-node_9 (area '1') to improve load path. Verify geometry keeps mass under 30 and stress within ±15.",
  
  "reasoning": "Introducing node_10 between node_4 and node_7 reduces the length of the heavily stressed member_3, splitting forces and avoiding excessive stress. Removing the large compression member_5 eases overstress in the compression chord. Replacing member_7 with more directly connected members reduces stress concentration. Assigning larger areas only to members under higher stress to limit total mass. Keeping pinned and roller supports fixed to restrain structure properly.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Check all member lengths and associated areas for accurate mass calculation. Utilize areas from {0-10} ensuring no member area is excessively large. Ensure no duplicate members or nodes. Calculate length * area (density fixed at 1 per instructions) to summarize mass below 30.",
  
  "calculation": "Member lengths:\
  node_1-node_3: sqrt((2-0)^2 + (0-0)^2)=2.0\
  node_3-node_4: 3.0\
  node_4-node_10: sqrt((3.0-2.0)^2+(3.1-3.0)^2)=~1.0049875\
  node_10-node_7: sqrt((4-3.0)^2+(3.5-3.1)^2)=~1.0770\
  node_7-node_2: 4.0311\
  node_1-node_10: sqrt(3.0^2 + 3.1^2)=~4.314\

  node_8-node_9: 0 (removed)\
  node_10-node_9: sqrt((3.5-3.0)^2 + (2.6 - 3.1)^2)=0.7071\

  Assign member areas to keep stresses ≤15, for example:\
  member_1 (node_1-node_3): area '2'=0.782\
  member_2 (node_3-node_4): area '2'=0.782\
  member_3 (node_4-node_10): area '2'=0.782\
  member_4 (node_10-node_7): area '2'=0.782\
  member_5 (node_7-node_2): area '3'=1.759\
  member_6 (node_1-node_10): area '1'=0.195\
  member_7 (node_3-node_8): area '2'=0.782\
  member_8 (node_10-node_9): area '1'=0.195\
  member_9 (node_9-node_7): area '2'=0.782\
  \
  Mass = sum(length*area):\
  2.0*0.782 + 3.0*0.782 + 1.0049875*0.782 + 1.0770*0.782 + 4.0311*1.759 + 4.314*0.195 + 2.855*0.782 + 0.7071*0.195 + 0.984*0.782 = \
  1.564 + 2.346 + 0.786 + 0.842 + 7.095 + 0.841 + 2.232 + 0.138 + 0.77 = 16.514 < 30 OK\
