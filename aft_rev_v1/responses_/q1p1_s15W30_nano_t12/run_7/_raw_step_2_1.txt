Larger area did not reduce stress sufficiently. Node_5 placement causes inefficient force paths increasing member_6 stress. Members connecting below and above follow triangle topology but are not balanced well in load distribution; stress concentration and bending possibly occurs at member_6.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider revising node_5 placement to reduce member_6 length and increase direct load path to supports via better triangulation. Remove member_6 or redistribute connections. Increase cross section only where critical, prefer shorter members to lower stress.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_5; add new intermediate node above node_3 for load transfer (say node_6 at (3.0, 3.7)) forming two symmetric triangles; connect node_3 to node_6, node_6 to node_4 (2,3), node_6 to node_2 (6,0); keep existing supports and load node; members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_6, node_6-node_4, node_6-node_2; assign area ids based on member length and expected stress demand.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing node_5 and redistributing the vertical and diagonal members reduces oversized bending in long members; new node_6 creates stiffer load path to supports reducing tensile/compressive overloads. Keeping supports unchanged preserves boundary conditions; moderate member lengths expected to limit stresses within ±15 with appropriate areas.
