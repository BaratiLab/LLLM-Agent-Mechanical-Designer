Large stresses on members connected to node_6 (top-right). Mass is below 30 but inefficient stress distribution. Support nodes fixed at bottom left and bottom right roller. Load at node_3.

Node_6 too close to node_3, creating long, slender members with high stress. Current area assignments do not suffice.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Add one intermediary node above node_4 to distribute load better. Create more equilateral triangulation for members. Use smaller areas on lengths where stress is higher via shorter members and appropriate area assignment. Retain existing supports and load nodes.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Rearranging node_6 to higher vertical position above node_4 and add node_7 between node_4 and node_2 to reduce length and better triangularize load path.
