  "preamble": "Optimize truss to meet stresses <= |15| and mass <= 30 under given load/support.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load applied at node_3 downward-left(45°), supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller. Current max stress 47 >15, mass 21.7<30. Stress is main constraint violation.",
  
  "analysis": "Current structure has high stress on member_2 (-47) exceeding -15 tensile/compressive limit. Member_2 is between node_3 and node_4 with smallest area=1 (0.195). Increasing area is an option but will increase mass and limited. Load path needs better distribution. Members near node_3 and node_4 highly stressed. Adding a vertical strut or redesigning topology to transfer load more efficiently might work. The top nodes (node_6, node_7) seem higher to better distribute forces. Current high stress is at member_2, slight overuse of higher-area members with big lengths.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Options: 1) Increase area of member_2, check effect; 2) Add diagonal member from node_1 to node_4 or node_6 to enhance stiffness; 3) Move existing intermediate nodes higher or rearrange connections; mass allows some flexibility to add/remove members. Avoid changing nodes load/support nodes.",
  
  "proposal": "Modify structure by: Keep existing load and supports. Move node_6 lower to around y=4.0 to reduce length and force concentration. Replace member_5 with lighter area. Add member from node_1 to node_6 to create stiff triangle to spread load from node_3. Use cross braces between node_4, node_6 and node_7 to form multiple force paths. Adjust areas to keep stress <= ±15. Final nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2,3), node_6(3,4.0), node_7(4,3.5). Members: '1-3'(area 2), '3-4'(area 2), '4-7'(area 2), '7-2'(area 3), '6-4'(area 1), '6-7'(area 2), '3-6'(area 2), new member '1-6'(area 1).",
  
  "reasoning": "Lowering node_6 reduces oversized lever effect decreasing stress in member_2; adding member 1-6 creates triangle 1,3,6 for force distribution. Cross-bracing via members 6-7 and 6-4 allow alternative tension/compression paths lowering peak stress. Moving node_7 to 4.0 y is avoided to respect constraints from past high loads there. Areas balanced for light but effective load transfer. Member 4-7 assigned area 2 since connects upper node to frame. Member 7-2 heavier loads kept with area 3.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Length calcs using coordinates for mass: e.g. length(1-3)=2m, area 2=0.782->mass~1.56 Also member (1-6) length = sqrt(3²+4²)=5m × area1(0.195)=0.975 mass; stress assumed roughly divided by adding member. Max stress expected <15 with this configuration.",
  
  "calculation": "Horizontal base 6m. Node details: node_6 at (3,4.0). Member lengths: 1-3=2, 3-4=3, 4-7=2, 7-2 ≈ sqrt((6-4)² +0²)=2, 6-4=√(1²+1²)=1.414, 6-7=√(1² +0.5²)=~1.118, 3-6=√(1² +4²)=~4.123, 1-6=5. Mass sum under 30 allowed. Stress expected to redistribute and decrease significantly meeting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New member 1-6 added; node_6 lowered from 5.5 to 4.0 reduces member_5 length and stress. Areas adjusted. No change to load/support nodes. No duplicates. Plan reduces main stress on member_2 and distributes load evenly.",
