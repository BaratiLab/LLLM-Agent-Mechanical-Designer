Current max stress 47 >15, mass 21.7<30. Stress is main constraint violation.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has high stress on member_2 (-47) exceeding -15 tensile/compressive limit. Member_2 is between node_3 and node_4 with smallest area=1 (0.195). Increasing area is an option but will increase mass and limited. Load path needs better distribution. Members near node_3 and node_4 highly stressed. Adding a vertical strut or redesigning topology to transfer load more efficiently might work. The top nodes (node_6, node_7) seem higher to better distribute forces. Current high stress is at member_2, slight overuse of higher-area members with big lengths.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Options: 1) Increase area of member_2, check effect; 2) Add diagonal member from node_1 to node_4 or node_6 to enhance stiffness; 3) Move existing intermediate nodes higher or rearrange connections; mass allows some flexibility to add/remove members. Avoid changing nodes load/support nodes.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Modify structure by: Keep existing load and supports. Move node_6 lower to around y=4.0 to reduce length and force concentration. Replace member_5 with lighter area. Add member from node_1 to node_6 to create stiff triangle to spread load from node_3. Use cross braces between node_4, node_6 and node_7 to form multiple force paths. Adjust areas to keep stress <= ±15.

Cross-bracing via members 6-7 and 6-4 allow alternative tension/compression paths lowering peak stress. Moving node_7 to 4.0 y is avoided to respect constraints from past high loads there.
