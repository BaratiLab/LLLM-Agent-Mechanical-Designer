  "preamble": "Optimizing closed 2D truss to minimize stress under load, with supports fixed and max stress and mass constraints.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given 3 nodes: node_1 at origin pinned, node_2 at (6,0) roller, node_3 load at (2,0) with force -10 at -45°. Max ±15 stress and max mass = 30. Use given discrete cross-sectional areas. Need a closed truss (all nodes connected and forming closed loop). No change to node positions allowed. Optimize member layout and areas.",
  
  "analysis": "The structure must be a closed truss enclosing the load node. Existing nodes nearly collinear along x-axis, so add node above to create a triangle or a slightly complex polygon to provide geometry resisting the diagonal load at node_3. Adding node_4 above improves geometry, improves load path stiffness and reduces stress. Use a four-node trapezoid or triangle shape for a closed structure. Calculate lengths for members; rectangular stresses mostly axial forces by static equilibrium and truss theory. Cross-sectional areas chosen to keep stress ≤15 and total mass under 30. Assume members under tension or compression only axial force. Ignore bending for this analysis.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Added node_4 approx (2.0, 3.0) to create closed loop: node_1->node_4->node_2->node_3->node_1. Members: 1-3, 3-4, 4-2, 1-4, 2-3. Use 5 members to maintain closed shape. Approximate forces using equilibrium. Use smallest area possible to maintain max stress and mass caps.",
  
  "reasoning": "1) Increase structural depth to handle diagonal load from node_3 with compressive and tensile members.\n2) Triangulating with node_4 reduces stress by better load distribution.\n3) Members connecting in triangular fashion enhance stability and stiffness.\n4) Calculate approximate member length and forces using equilibrium equations.\n5) Choose member area from provided sets to meet stress and mass limits.\n6) Validate mass = sum(length_i * area_i) ≤30, and max axial load_i/area_i ≤15. This iteration aims for minimal masses with simple load paths.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Use static equilibrium at nodes: at node_3, force is (-10N, -45°) approx Fx = -7.07 N, Fy = -7.07 N. Assume reaction at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller has vertical reaction only. Compute internal force focal points.\nLength calc: between points sqrt((x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2).\nStress σ = F / A;\nArea A chosen to ensure |σ| ≤ 15.\nMass = sum length × area must ≤ 30.\nArea units implicit for mass calc validity.",
