Member_3 under highest compression. Load at node_3 vertical downward, nodes 1 and 2 support fixed. Only movable node is node_5.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max compressive stress in member_3 (-9.08) is high relative to others. Member_3 connects node_3 (fixed) to node_5 (movable). Moving node_5 downward closer to node_3 may reduce length and member stress. Member_2 and member_5 carry tensile load; area selection varied. Reducing member_3 axial force can minimize max stress. Member_1 and member_4 less critical. Current design satisfies mass limit with some margin.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider lowering node_5 y-position below 3.25 towards 2.8-3.0 to reduce compression. Keep node_5 x near 2.3 to maintain geometry. Small adjustments help redistribute forces.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Shorter members reduce force magnitude and stress if load path somewhat modified. A slight vertical adjustment ลดун node_5 y from 3.25 to ~2.9 keeps stable geometry and slightly shorter tension/compression paths in members_3, _2, _5. Avoid large shifts to prevent mass increase from area changes. Area _2 for member_3 kept as 0.782 (area_id \'2\') to balance strength.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "No node changes for node_1, node_2, node_3. Adjust node_5 y coordinate only.

Expected member_3 length decrease and force reduction; expect max stress reduce below 9.08 towards 7.5-8. Member areas kept same from iteration_4 for simplicity, mass likely slightly reduced due to shorter lengths. Total mass still safely < 30. Members remain same to keep simple minimal model. Setup remains fully constrained with supports and loads same.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Check no violation compression or tension stress ≥ ±15; estimated max stress at member_3 around 7.5 after move.
