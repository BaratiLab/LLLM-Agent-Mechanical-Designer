  "preamble": "Optimize node_5 position to reduce max stress and maintain constraints while keeping current node topology.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives: minimize max stress ≤ ±15, total mass ≤ 30, nodes fixed for supports/loads, adjusting node_5 allowed. Last max stress ~9.05, total mass ~24.24 within limits. Member areas retained from prior iteration suggesting balance. Member_3 is highest abs stress ~9.05 (compressive).",
  
  "analysis": "Since max stress (9.05) is below the 15 allowable limit, objective focuses on minimizing stress further without exceeding mass 30. Total mass is well below max allowed, giving flexibility. Node_5 vertical position near 3.0 meters affects force distribution on members connected (member_2, member_3, member_5). Slight adjustment of node_5 could reduce stress on critical member_3 (-9.053), a key compressive member between node_3 and node_5. Node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed by constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing height or shifting node_5 laterally may balance stress between tension and compression. Current iteration moved node_5 lower and slightly left compared to prior; consider finer shifts upward or horizontally close to 2.1-2.2 x position and near 3.0 y to reduce peak compression on member_3. Small changes to node_5 position expected to change force paths diminishing peak stress.",
  
  "reasoning": "Adjust node_5 x coordinate slightly right to 2.2 to redistribute load path more symmetrically between nodes 1 and 2, slight increase y to ~3.1 m for stance height. Maintain current member area selection since areas reflect stress-based section sizing and are consistent across last design iterations near optimal. Closed structure ensures stability. No member addition/removal allowed. This approach likely to reduce peak stress while retaining stability and mass within limit.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "From geometry, member_3 (node_3 to node_5) is critical; length change affects stress = force / area. Increasing node_5 y slightly increases length, reducing stress per axial force. Also node_5 closer to mid-span ensures force path balanced. Total mass change minimal for slight node move. Area IDs already optimized (3 or 2).",
  
  "calculation": "node_5 move from (2.15,3.05) to (2.2,3.1): New lengths: member_3 ~ sqrt((2.0-2.2)^2+(0.0-3.1)^2)=3.11 (0.1 longer than before 2.97), slight length increase reducing stress by ~3%. Member masses increase slightly, negligible vs total mass. Max stress expected to slightly drop below 9.05 along member_3 and member_1 negatives improving. Areas remain unchanged.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Ensure no violation of constraints: stress max likely ≤9.0 after revision, mass ≤25 still. Node_5 position valid, no duplication or removal. Member connections intact with existing area ID assignments. Support/load nodes unchanged.",
