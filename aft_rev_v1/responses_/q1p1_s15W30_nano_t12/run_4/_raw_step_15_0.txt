Load at node_3, fixed supports at node_1 and node_2. Optimize node_5 position and member areas from given discrete set without moving load/support nodes.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current max stress is 9.09, safely below limit 15. Total mass 22.1511, well below max 30. Node_5 moved iteratively closer to optimum at [2.25, 2.4]. Areas chosen with reasonably sized cross sections for load demands. No constraint violated, closed truss maintained.",  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress pattern shows member_3 near peak compression (~-9.09). Slight adjustments in node_5 in past iterations impacted stress distribution marginally. Further lowering stress below 9 usually involves significant geometry change or area selection, limited by discrete areas and nodes fixed at load/support.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Given iterative results, node_5 position at (2.25, 2.4) balances tension/compression well. Area sizes (3 for members 1,2,5; 2 for members 3,4) provide adequate area for current load/stress demands without excess mass. Marginal improvements by shifting node_5 further leads to increasing mass or stress; so it\'s close to local optimum. Member 3 carries max compression; member 1 tension slightly reduced. No violations or drastically overloaded members.",  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Maintaining existing load/support nodes fixed; only node_5 adjusted. Member length and cross sectional area combination results in current mass and stress distribution. Stress below ±15 by a margin of ~5. Optimize further would risk areas out of allowed discrete set or break constraints with no benefit in stress reduction.",\n\n  "calculation": "Current total mass = 22.1511 < 30. Max stress = 9.09 < 15. Area assignments consistent with member stresses and manageable lengths. No member exceeds stress or negligibly loaded. Slight geometry displacement confirmed optimal trend around node_5 at (2.25, 2.4). Further numerical tweaking tested in history yields oscillatory behavior without significant reduction.",  \n  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints satisfied.
