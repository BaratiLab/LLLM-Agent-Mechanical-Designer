Need closed truss (all nodes connected forming at least one cycle). Stress ±15 max, mass ≤30, select areas from given discrete values. Aim: minimize stress, obey constraints.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Closed truss with nodes at (0,0), (6,0), and (2,0) is currently colinear. This cannot resist out-of-plane or vertical load effectively, so add at least one additional node above. Create a triangular truss shape with 4 nodes total: add a node above on x-axis between existing nodes to form stable triangle(s). This triangular geometry will transform vertical/horizontal loads into axial member forces which can better respect stress limits. Considering load at node_3 is (-10, -45°), meaning a force acting left and down. Use simple statics and assume linear axial members. Member cross-sectional area selections to address stress and mass.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at approx (3.0, 3.0) forming two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4).

Calculate member lengths, select minimum member areas for stress < ±15 and total mass <30.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "To minimize stress, assign larger cross-section area to members with higher axial force. Closest member to load will face tension/compression. Approximate tension and compression from static equilibrium decompositions: Vertical and horizontal components shared by members in the height and base. Members diagonally placed will share force effectively. Mass approximated as sum(member length × area). Area choices discretized; prefer smallest area to minimize mass and check stress; increase area if stress limits exceeded. Stress = force / area; force from assumed equilibria.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assume symmetrical load distribution: portion of load carried by members (1-4), (4-3) for lifting, and (3-2), (2-4) balancing the base with roller support at node 2.
