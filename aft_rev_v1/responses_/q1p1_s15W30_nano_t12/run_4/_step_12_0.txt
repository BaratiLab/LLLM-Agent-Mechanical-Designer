    "preamble": "Optimization at step 11 achieved constraint satisfaction with moderate stress and mass.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max stress Â±15, max mass 30. Current max stress ~9.08, mass ~23.2. Optimization aims to reduce stress further by repositioning free node and maintaining area assignments.",
    
    "analysis": "Current structure has concentrated max compressive stress (-9.08) in member_3 and tensile stress in member_2 and 5 moderate. Mass is well below max. Node_5 moved closer down (2.25, 2.75) reducing stress from prior upwards peaks (~3.1 y) while keeping others stable. Member areas are widely chosen with heavier members (3) on longer rods for stiffness.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "Small adjustments around Node_5 position vertically or slightly horizontally could homogenize force flow; reducing stress in member_3 which is highest compressively loaded. Ensure no deterioration in load/support nodes positions or mass increase beyond limits. Areas seem reasonable; stress levels under 10 are healthy.",
    
    "reasoning": "Member_3 stress at -9.08 implies compression; shortening this member or adjusting geometry may alleviate. Increasing angle at Node_5 relative to node 3-1 triangle better distributes forces. Considering current mass of 23.24 and max 30, some margin for area or length adjustment exists but adding mass risks raising stress if geometry not optimized first. Small changes near current node_5 position likely efficient. Due to 2 decimal positional values before, more precision ordering in y near 2.6-2.8 possible.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Current member areas IDs: member_1 (3 - 1.759), member_2 (3 -1.759), member_3 (2 -0.782), member_4 (2 -0.782), member_5 (3 -1.759). These allow balance of stiffness and weight; member 3 mass smallest. No immediate need to change area selections. Calculate member lengths with node moves and reassess forces/stress.",
    
    "calculation": "Node_5 moved slightly lower 2.25,2.65 shifting compression from member_3 (-9.08-> ~ -8.5 estimated) while lengths moderate. Preserves mass ~23.1. Member lengths expected slight decrease for member_3 reducing stresses. Other stress levels remain stable or minor improvements expected. Maintains simple closed geometry for structural determinacy. Load at node_3 and supports fixed as required. Member connections unchanged.",
    "scratch_pad_final": "With slight repositioning of Node_5 down to (2.25, 2.65) keeping member areas as before, expect stress reduction in max compressive member without mass penalty, maintaining constraints and improving design performance. Further drastic improvements limited by geometry and load/support locations.",
