Member_3 has highest compressive stress causing max stress. Need to reduce stress especially in member_3 while keeping mass low.",\n  "analysis": "Node_1 and node_2 are fixed; node_3 fixed due to load; only node_5 can be repositioned. Current node_5 at (2.5, 3.8) seems to induce high compression in member_3 (node_3-node_5). Area selections currently: member_1=3(1.759), member_2=3(1.759), member_3=2(0.782), member_4=2(0.782), member_5=3(1.759). Mass units are composite length*area factors leading to given total. Member_3 under max stress allowed but is near limit and dominant. Adjust node_5 closer towards node_3 in y to reduce compression length under load; slightly shift x for triangle stiffness. Also, up member_3 area from 0.782 to 1.759 (area_id=3) to further reduce stress. Should maintain closed truss and no duplicates.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Move node_5 from (2.5,3.8) to approx (2.3,3.0). Update member_3 area from \'2\' to \'3\'. Check mass and stress estimates. Estimated member lengths: member_3 shorter will reduce stress; increase area reduces stress as stress ~ force/area; total mass increase small if only one area up. Expected to reduce max_stress below current 9.12 closer to 7-8 and total_mass slightly up but under 30. Closed truss still maintained with members connecting node_1-node_5, node_3-node_5, node_2-node_5.",\n  "reasoning": "Lowering node_5 Y reduces lever arm effect at node_3 thus decreases compression demand in member_3. Increasing area lowers stress from force / area and minimizes failure risk. Maintain other members at current areas as stress levels are acceptable to keep mass low. Constraints ensure no stress beyond ±15 and total mass <30. Carefully picking area 3 for members with max stress balanced with mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Areas: from dict - \'2\' = 0.782, \'3\' = 1.759. Member_3 area increase = +0.977 area units × length(approx 4 from rough distance sqrt((2.0-2.3)^2 + (0.0-3.0)^2) ~3). Mass ~ length × area, so mass increase ~ 3 × 0.977=~2.9 units, total mass now ~29.6 <30. Expected max stress decreasing by approx 20-25%.",\n  "calculation": "Node_5 new coordinates (2.3, 3.0). Member_3 area changed from \'2\' to \'3\'. Other area ids unchanged. Members: member_1: \'3\'; member_2: \'3\'; member_3: \'3\'; member_4: \'2\'; member_5: \'3\'. Node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed: (0.0, 0.0), (6.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0). This reposition improves compressive stress in member_3, stays within mass limit.
