  "preamble": "Optimize node_5 location to reduce max stress while controlling mass within limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress is 9.08 which is well within ±15, total mass 22.9194 is below 30. Nodes with loads/support fixed (node_1, node_2, node_3). Only node_5 available for movement.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_3 has max negative stress (-9.08) close to max stress limit but still acceptable. Member areas selected: member_1,2,5 are area 3 (1.759), member_3,4 area 2 (0.782). Mass is low, and max stress is dominated by member_3. Location of node_5 affects force distribution in members involving it. Prior iterations fluctuated node_5 between y=2.65 to 3.25 showing 9.0+ stress values.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing y-coordinate slightly might neutralize some tension/compression to member_3, decreasing peak stress. Maintaining triangle integrity to keep closed structure. Maintain x-coordinate close to 2.2-2.3 for balance.",

  "reasoning": "Moving node_5 slightly lower and/or horizontally adjusting may minimize stress. Areas sizes are fixed, cannot change for members without creating new members. Constraints enforce closed structure with existing members only. Load at node_3 is negative magnitude (compression) with -45 degrees; stress in member_3 likely due to this. Slight changes in y of node_5 from current 2.65 to ~2.55 should reduce bending and stress due to improved force equilibrium. Keep x around 2.25 for compatibility. No change in node_1,2,3 positions.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_5 (2.25,2.65) max stress = 9.08; move node_5 to e.g. (2.25, 2.55) and calculate approximate member lengths and estimated stress reduction. Member_3 length ~ sqrt((2-2.25)^2+(0-2.55)^2)=~2.55; previously was ~2.65 distance. Minor length reduction to reduce stress. With less length, lower stress in compression expected.",

  "calculation": "New node_5: (2.25, 2.55)\nMember lengths:\nmember_1 (node_1-node_3): fixed\nmember_2 (node_1-node_5): length ≈ sqrt(2.25^2+2.55^2) ≈ 3.4 (previously ~3.52)\nmember_3 (node_3-node_5): length ≈ sqrt(0.25^2 + 2.55^2) ≈ 2.57 (before ~2.65)\nTotal mass will slightly reduce due to shorter members with same area\nMoments redistributed to reduce member_3 compression peak slightly. Expect max stress slightly <9.\nMass expectation < previous 22.9194 still < 30.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Ensure no new members, node positions precise, no rounding, and constraints max stress ±15, mass <30 respected. Node_5 only moved to (2.25, 2.55).\nNote: All other node positions fixed. Maintain existing member areas.\nOptimize further in next iterations if needed.",
