Mass 22.6 under limit 30. Current node_5 at (2.25, 2.55). Load at node_3, supports fixed. Members 1 and 3 show highest compressive stress near -9.1.",\n  "analysis": "Members member_1 (node_1-node_3) and member_3 (node_3-node_5) have highest compressive stress close to -9.1, member_2 tension 3.574 and member_5 tension ~2.38 are well below limit. Vertical location of node_5 affects member_3 length and angle strongly, adjusting node_5\'s height affects stress distribution. Horizontal is constrained near 2.25 for connectivity and geometry balance. Reducing node_5 y slightly may relieve stress on member_3 and member_1 tension/compression balance, while keeping geometry stable and mass low.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try node_5 y from 2.55 down to ~2.4 gradually. Keep area assignments as is (area_IDs 2 and 3 for members 1,2,5 - proven effective). Area choice balances adequate stiffness/mass.",\n  "reasoning": "Stress influenced by nodal geometry affecting axial forces and member lengths. Slight node_5 vertical moves within [2.4, 2.55] maintain load path and support conditions, alter stress distribution favorably. Lowering y reduces slenderness in member_3, decreasing max compressive stress. Mass reduces slightly due to shortened member_3 length. Drastic changes avoided to keep feasible stable truss.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "member_3 length current ~ sqrt((2.25-2.0)^2 + (2.55-0)^2) = sqrt(0.0625 + 6.5025) = ~2.55.
