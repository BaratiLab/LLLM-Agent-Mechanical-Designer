  "preamble": "Optimize node 5 position to reduce max stress and maintain mass constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Maximum stress currently ~9.1 < 15; mass 22.9 < 30. Node_5 controls force path and stiffness upward. Members have areas 2 or 3 providing moderate stiffness/mass balance. Load on node_3 at 45Â° downward left. Supports fixed at node_1(left pinned) and node_2(right roller).",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress member_3 is tensile near limit at -9.1. Slight increase in height of node_5 previously helped reduce stresses. Could further adjust node_5 upward to reduce compression in member_3 and better align force flow. Minor increases in height do not overly increase mass due to shorter angled lengths. Areas can remain same or slightly lower since mass must stay below 30. No nodes can move except node_5. Members well connected - topology fixed.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Small adjustments upward and slight right for node_5 to decrease tension in member_3 and marginally redistribute stresses. Check resulting max stress on compression and tensile members. Maintain same member areas for mass efficiency. Design seems near optimal in prior iterations; small height shifts still favorable.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_3 with area 2 is critical. Raising node_5 raises length and stiffness in members connected to node_5, possibly lowering their stress duration. Member_1 and member_2 with area 3 show moderate stress margin and can handle slight redistribution. Member_4 area 2 with lower tension. Member_5 area 3 can bear low stress with slight force shifts. Node_5 at x=2.3 may slightly move right to reduce bending in member_3. Careful not to move left toward node_3 or compress member_3 more. Stop when gain plateaus.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Use previous good geometry from iteration_3 to_6 as guide. Will test node_5 at (2.4, 2.9). Member lengths update recalculated. Areas fixed: member_1=3, member_2=3, member_3=2, member_4=2, member_5=3.",
  
  "calculation": "1. Calculate new member lengths with node_5 at (2.4, 2.9): \n- member_1: dist(node_1, node_3) = 2.0\n- member_2: dist(node_1, node_5) = sqrt((2.4-0)^2 + (2.9-0)^2) ~3.75\n- member_3: dist(node_3, node_5) = sqrt((2.4-2)^2 + (2.9-0)^2) ~2.92\n- member_4: dist(node_2, node_3) = 4.0\n- member_5: dist(node_2, node_5) = sqrt((6-2.4)^2 + (0-2.9)^2) ~4.84\n\nMass estimations:\nMember masses = sum(length * area_value)\nArea values: '2' -> 0.782, '3'->1.759\nmass_1 = 2.0 * 1.759 = 3.518\nmass_2 = 3.75 * 1.759 = 6.596\nmass_3 = 2.92 * 0.782 = 2.283\nmass_4 = 4.0 * 0.782 = 3.128\nmass_5 = 4.84 * 1.759 = 8.51\nTotal mass = 3.518+6.596+2.283+3.128+8.51 = 23.99 < 30\n\nExpected effect: Hustles member_3 stress from -9.1 to less, improvement in global stress distribution.\n",
  "scratch_pad_final": "After moving node_5 to (2.4,2.9), member masses increase marginally to mass ~24 but remain below limit. Max stress expected to decrease from 9.1 MPa. Thus this iteration improves stress state and respects mass bound and max stress constraint.",
