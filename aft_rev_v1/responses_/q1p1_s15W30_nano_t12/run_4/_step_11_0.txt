  "preamble": "Refining truss node elevation to reduce stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Goal: minimize max stress < ±15; mass < 30. Load at node_3; supports fixed. Current max stress ~9.06 is good. Preserve supports and load nodes. Members use area IDs 2 and 3 primarily. Minor stress reductions can improve performance and safety factor.",
  
  "analysis": "Current layout forms stable closed 2D truss with node_5 slightly adjustable. Stress distribution shows max stress ~9 at member_3 (node_3-node_5) in compression. Members_1 to _5 have areas 3,3,2,2,3 respectively. Slightly lowering or repositioning node_5 could better distribute stress from loaded node_3, reducing member_3 compressive stress. Member masses and total mass satisfactory. No members close to limits or obviously oversized.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider improved geometry by slightly reducing y-coordinate of node_5 from 3.1 to around 2.7-2.8, increasing node_5 x slightly (~2.25). This reduces length and compression in member_3. Could keep areas as is for now to save mass and not increase member size. Crossing members unnecessary given closed shape. Maintain member areas for best trade-off between stress and mass.",
  
  "reasoning": "Minimizing stress focuses on reducing peak compression on member_3 by geometrically optimizing node_5. Lowering node_5 reduces member_3 length and axial compression while keeping forces more balanced. A slight x-position shift helps keep triangulation and balance forces. Since all stresses are well under limits, main gains are small redesign for better local force distribution rather than area changes, which risk increased mass. Mass is well under 30, so gentle shape adjustment should be safe.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths calculated to check mass: member lengths ~ member length × area coefficient sums to 24.388 at iteration 10. Lowering node_5 decreases member_3 length, possibly member_2 and member_5 length increases slightly. Will verify mass after adjustment. Stress cutoffs at ±15 still not reached, so changes to geometry for stress reduction preferable over increasing area. Using area ids properly for cost benefit proven in history.",
  
  "calculation": "Shift node_5 = (2.25, 2.75). Recalculate member_3 length: ||2.0 - 2.25, 0 - 2.75|| ~ sqrt(0.25^2 + 2.75^2) ≈ 2.76 (down from ~3.106). This reduces compression force length effect. Other member lengths stay close; member_2 length increases marginally. Area IDs kept same {'2': 0.782, '3': 1.759}. Total mass recalculated approximately stays ~24.3 (small reduction). Expected max stress reduction by 5-10%, likely max stress < 8.5.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_5 adjustment only; no member area changes; respect constraints and instructions. No node position changes for supports/load nodes. Maintain given member sets; no new members. Stress and mass under limits, iteration count not reached max. Proceed further optimization possible in later steps.",
