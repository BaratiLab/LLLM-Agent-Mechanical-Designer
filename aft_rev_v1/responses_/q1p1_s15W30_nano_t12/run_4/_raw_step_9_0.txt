Node_1, node_2, and node_3 fixed; only node_5 movable. Aim to minimize max stress further mainly targeting member_3, which has highest magnitude stress ~ -9.09. Member cross-sectional areas mostly fixed; focus on node repositioning for stress reduction.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Maximum stress remains dominated by member_3 under compression at -9.0874. Adjacent members have lower stress. The triangular truss shape determined by nodes (1,3,5) and (2,3,5) and their area IDs appear relatively optimal but brittle for high loads on node_3. Moving node_5 slightly to slightly alter the force paths could reduce stress concentration on member_3. The symmetric position was varied (iterations 5-8) around node_5 = (2.3, ~2.6-3.25); slight increase in elevation improved stress but increased mass. Consider small upward shift and lateral shift in x to possibly reduce moments and improve force distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_3 is shortest member from node_3 to node_5. Increasing vertical distance or moving node_5 nearer to node_3 along x-axis may reduce compressive force. Balancing between member length increase (adds mass) and force reduction is critical. Cross-sectional areas are mostly set to 3 or 2, which suit needed strength. Fine-tuning position of node_5 within bounds near (2.2,3.1) might yield better stress despite minor mass increase.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Moving node_5 upward increases its vertical height, potentially compressive stresses rise if area is unchanged. Moving node_5 slightly left closer to node_3 decreases member_3 length, redistributing forces and reducing compressive stresses in member_3. Area selection for members consistent with previous. Only node_5 movable. No new nodes or members to keep closed truss shape and avoid duplicated members. Adjust node_5 from (2.3, 3.0) to (2.15, 3.05) to target lower max stress and acceptable mass increment.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Areas: member_1(3=1.759), member_2(3), member_3(2=0.782), member_4(2), member_5(3). Current stresses: member_3 highest compression (-9.087), target reduce closer to -7 to -8 range, max stress reduce ~10-20% while keeping total mass ≤ 30 in balance. Mass sensitivity acceptable for length changes ~0.5m. Loads and supports fixed. All member connections unchanged. Node_5 adjusted precisely to address peak compressive stress.",\n\n  "calculation": "Update node_5 position: (2.15, 3.05). Expected slight decrease in member_3 length reduces force magnitude. Member lengths approx: L13=2.0, L25=√((6-2.15)^2 + (0-3.05)^2)= ~4.08, L35=√((2-2.15)^2 + (0-3.05)^2)= ~3.05 instead of previous ~3.04. Expected effect: reduced compression along member_3 as node_5 moves left. Total mass likely slightly changed but within limits (~24-25). Max stress reduce ~10%.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Check constraints: max stress <15 pass (expected <9), total mass <30 pass (~24). No duplicated nodes or members. Load/support nodes fixed. Areas maintained. Node_5 moved slightly left and up for stress reduction granted minimal mass penalty.
