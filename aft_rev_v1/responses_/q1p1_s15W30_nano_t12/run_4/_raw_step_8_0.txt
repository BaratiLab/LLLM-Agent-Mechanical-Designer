Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. No area change. Nodes load/support fixed except node_5.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress localized in member_3 (~-9.13). It\'s compression dominant member between node_3 and padded node_5. Members with high mass are member_2 and member_5 (both area \'3\'). Slight change in node_5 vertical position altered stresses minutely. We can try subtle horizontal and vertical adjustments for node_5 to lower peak compressive stress while maintaining closed geometry.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Shift node_5 slightly more horizontally towards node_3 and upwards slightly may reduce compressive stress in member_3 due to load resultants\' path changing. Small shifts prevent mass increase from longer members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing node_5 y slightly would counter compressive buckling in member_3, reducing its stress magnitude. Moving node_5 in x nearer to node_3 reduces length of member_5 and member_2 slightly impacting stress forces and possibly their lengths causing less mass. Since member areas fixed currently, length optimization helps slightly reduce mass and stress. Keep node_5 inside span to avoid structural inefficiency but move closer to line of force path from load.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check effect of delta x ~= -0.1 from 2.4 to 2.3 and delta y from 2.9 to 3.0.
