Member areas selected: member_1,2,5 are area 3 (1.759), member_3,4 area 2 (0.782). Mass is low, and max stress is dominated by member_3. Location of node_5 affects force distribution in members involving it.

Areas sizes are fixed, cannot change for members without creating new members. Constraints enforce closed structure with existing members only. Load at node_3 is negative magnitude (compression) with -45 degrees; stress in member_3 likely due to this. Slight changes in y of node_5 from current 2.65 to ~2.55 should reduce bending and stress due to improved force equilibrium. Keep x around 2.25 for compatibility.
