Current structure at iteration 8 meets constraints with max stress 11.59 and total mass 22.359.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has balanced member sizing, all stress values within ±15, total mass well below mass limit. Node_1 and node_2 fixed due to support/load constraints. Minor moves of internal nodes have improved stress distribution. Member area assignments are consistent with stress magnitude, smaller areas in low tension/compression, larger in higher stress members. Structure is closed and does not have duplicates.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further optimization implies trade-off between mass reduction and stress minimization which risks breaching max stress constraint. Current design load path is efficient with minimal over-sized members. Remaining stresses (~±10-11) well within limits, no critical stress points identified.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Given current stresses below allowable limit by approx 25%, and mass ~75% of max allowed, significant gains in stress reduction unlikely by repositioning nodes without increasing mass. Member sizing is already adjusted logically for stress capacity. The topology cannot be further improved significantly given the fixed load/support. Adding or removing members or nodes not allowed. Therefore, current configuration is near optimal.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Validated stress signs, magnitudes, areas chosen consistent with load results and member lengths. Node displacements attempted previously showed less favorable stress distributions or mass increases. Positioned Nodes: n3 at (2,0), n4 at (3,2.2), n5 at (4.5,1.8) produces good triangulation reducing bending and shear load effects. Member area selection fits stress magnitude patterns for efficient design.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Max stress 11.5926 < 15, total mass 22.359 < 30; member stresses distributed between -9.93 and 11.59 compliant. Member areas mostly moderate (area 3=1.759 or area 2=0.782 for intermediate stresses, smaller areas 1=0.195 for low stresses), fully stressed members size well controlled. Mass sum computed with given lengths and areas. Node positions unchanged for load/support nodes as required. No duplicates in node/member sets.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Current results satisfy all constraints with balanced load sharing and stress distribution.
