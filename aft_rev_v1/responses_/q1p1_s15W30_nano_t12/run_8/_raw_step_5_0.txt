Load (-10 @ node_3) and supports fixed. Reduce stress by redesign/modifying members around node_6 with largest stress member_4 constraining forces better.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_4 (node_5-node_6) has stress -95.84 way above limit, so cross member with area 1 is overstressed. Node_6 position and connections cause high stress. Members around node_6 (member_5,6) also stressed but less. Mass still within limits, so increase area possible selectively on stressed members or improve geometry for load paths.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding node to alter force path, change node_6 from elongated horizontal span to more vertical alignment may reduce bending and related stress. Increase areas on high stress members up to area=\'3\'(1.759) but maintaining low mass, or better structurally triangulate around load at node_3.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node (node_7) near load with vertical offset to improve load transfer, keep existing nodes load/support fixed, restructure around node_5,node_6,node_7: connect node_3 - node_7, node_7 - node_5, modify areas: increase high stressed members to area_3 and use area\'s increase where required. Small moves so structure remains stable.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Placing node_7 vertically supports distributing load better, breaks long horizontal compressive member_4. Increased area on critical members reduces stress. Added connectivity for triangulation enhances stiffness, redistributes load, reducing max stress and keeps mass reasonable under 30 limit.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress proportional to force/area, increasing area reduces stress linearly. Length effects matter: my main concern is large force in member_4, so either reduce force by geometry or increase area. Mass=length*area, adding node adds members but choice of small lengths mitigates mass increase.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Existing areas: member_4 area=\'1\' (0.195) insufficient, increase to area=\'3\' (1.759). Add node_7 at (2.5,1.4) approx, near node_5 and node_3 height. New members soldered node_3-node_7(2), node_7-node_5(2). Short length expected about 0.9-1.0 each. Previous max stress member_6 combined reduced by new configuration. Member lengths calculated from Euclidean distance, sum mass verify <30.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Check no duplicate nodes, consistent member connections. Validate supports and load nodes not moved. New topology ensures load path reconfigured reduces over stress at member_4.
