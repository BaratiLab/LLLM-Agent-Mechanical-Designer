Constraints are stress ±15 and mass ≤30. Existing design overshoots max stress notably on members 4 and 7 (~63, -62) and mass near limit (~27). Need design redistribution to reduce peak stress and mass.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High stresses are seen in diagonal and longer members near node_4 and node_5. Member 4 (node_4-node_5) and Member 7 (node_4-node_2) exceed allowable stress significantly, indicating overloading of diagonals. Member 5 has stress slightly above limit (15.27). Load at node_3 downward and left induces compression/tension in bottom chords and top diagonals. Current node_5 placement (3.5,1.8) is close to mid-span but stress redistribution is inefficient. The truss members include multiple diagonals, but areas selected not balanced for load flow.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Drag node_5 slightly up and left to reduce member lengths and leverage. Switch to more evenly distributed members. Increase certain member areas to reduce stress but keep mass under 30 by removing redundant members or lowering areas in less stressed members. Avoid stress concentrations by adding a 5th node higher or repositioning node_5 upward to better carry load. Also favor triangulation for stiffness.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Maintain supports and load nodes. Remove member_4 (node_4-node_5) that was overstressed. Add a node_6 at (4.3, 2.1) to improve triangulation near loaded area. Connect members to new node_6 to break long diagonals and redistribute forces with moderate area cross-sections mostly 1 or 2 (area 0.195 or 0.782). Adjust bottom chord with stronger area at node_3-node_2 and node_1-node_3 to take direct load. Connect node_5 to node_6 and node_4, nodes 3 and 6 connected for force path. Assign areas aiming at stress ≤15 after re-routing forces.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing overstressed members reduces tension since these elements cause large stress. Adding a node in the upper right mid-span shortens diagonal spans (less bending and axial load concentration). Moderate member areas keep mass minimal. Using two-level triangulation with node_5 and node_6 assists in redirection of stresses allowing multiple paths for axial load. This configuration offers balanced compression and tension members polynomially below allowed 15 stress. Load path simplified from node_3 curving through node_5, node_6 vertically to top chord and laterally to supports.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and axial forces estimated with node coordinates. Use smaller cross-sections areas for members carrying less load and bigger on critical compression and tension chords on bottom and diagonals to supports. Monitor mass as sum of (length * area density). Approximate lengths via Euclidean distance. Peak stress ~force/(area * section modulus, assuming proportional to area), so increasing area cuts stress.",\n  \n  "calculation": "node_1: (0.0, 0.0), node_2:(6.0,0.0), node_3:(2.0,0.0), node_4:(2.0,2.5), node_5:(3.2,2.0), node_6:(4.3,2.1)\\n\\nMembers:\\nmember_1: node_1 - node_3, area_id \'3\' (1.759)\\nmember_2: node_3 - node_2, area_id \'3\' (1.759)\\nmember_3: node_3 - node_5, area_id \'2\' (0.782)\\nmember_4: node_5 - node_6, area_id \'1\' (0.195)\\nmember_5: node_6 - node_2, area_id \'3\' (1.759)\\nmember_6: node_4 - node_6, area_id \'2\' (0.782)\\nmember_7: node_4 - node_1, area_id \'1\' (0.195)\\nmember_8: node_5 - node_4, area_id \'2\' (0.782)\\n\\nClear removal of original member_4 to reduce peak stress.\\nEstimation of mass under 30 by calculations of member lengths * areas.\\nStress expected <15 due to shorter member lengths and adequate areas.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no repeated nodes or members.
