Additionally, member connections can be adjusted to reduce stress concentration near load at node_3. The topology with node_5 added creates redundancy but some zero stress members indicate inefficiency. Need to modify areas and potentially remove or relocate node_5 to reduce mass and stress. "\n,\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing area of low stressed members while increasing critical ones may optimize mass and stress. Also reconsider node_5 presence since member_8 stress is 0, maybe relocating node_5 or removing it reduces complexity and mass. Use higher areas at tension members from node_3 to node_2, which have largest tensile stress.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_5 to simplify design. Keep load/support nodes fixed. Use a four-node layout: node_1(0,0) pinned, node_2(6,0) roller, node_3(2,0) load, and node_4 raised to (2,2.5) to stiffen truss. Connect: member_1(node_1-node_3), member_2(node_3-node_2), member_3(node_3-node_4), member_4(node_4-node_1), member_5(node_4-node_2). Assign areas larger on tension members to reduce stress: member_2 area_id=3, member_3 area_id=2, others area_id=1 except member_4 area_id=2 for compressive support. This reduces stress and mass efficiently."\n,\n  "reasoning": "Since member_2 max tensile stress exceeds limit and member_1 compressive less critical, increasing member_2 area reduces tensile stress. Elevating node_4 improves load distribution decreasing stress in lower chord members. Removing node_5 decreases redundancy without affecting load carrying. Using small areas for low stressed members reduces mass but still meets stress constraint.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Verify lengths and expected stresses based on member areas and geometry.
