  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under load to meet stress ≤ ±15 and mass ≤ 30 constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 downward left; pinned at node_1, roller at node_2; some members overstressed; current mass under max but stresses exceed limit, especially member_2 tensile.",
  
  "analysis": "Max tensile stress -16.12 in member_2 with area_id=1 too small, increasing area can reduce stress. Additionally, member connections can be adjusted to reduce stress concentration near load at node_3. The topology with node_5 added creates redundancy but some zero stress members indicate inefficiency. Need to modify areas and potentially remove or relocate node_5 to reduce mass and stress. "
,
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing area of low stressed members while increasing critical ones may optimize mass and stress. Also reconsider node_5 presence since member_8 stress is 0, maybe relocating node_5 or removing it reduces complexity and mass. Use higher areas at tension members from node_3 to node_2, which have largest tensile stress.",
  
  "proposal": "Remove node_5 to simplify design. Keep load/support nodes fixed. Use a four-node layout: node_1(0,0) pinned, node_2(6,0) roller, node_3(2,0) load, and node_4 raised to (2,2.5) to stiffen truss. Connect: member_1(node_1-node_3), member_2(node_3-node_2), member_3(node_3-node_4), member_4(node_4-node_1), member_5(node_4-node_2). Assign areas larger on tension members to reduce stress: member_2 area_id=3, member_3 area_id=2, others area_id=1 except member_4 area_id=2 for compressive support. This reduces stress and mass efficiently."
,
  "reasoning": "Since member_2 max tensile stress exceeds limit and member_1 compressive less critical, increasing member_2 area reduces tensile stress. Elevating node_4 improves load distribution decreasing stress in lower chord members. Removing node_5 decreases redundancy without affecting load carrying. Using small areas for low stressed members reduces mass but still meets stress constraint.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Verify lengths and expected stresses based on member areas and geometry. Cross check mass with areas and estimated member lengths to ensure under 30. Members area choice considers stress magnitudes and directions from last FEM results.",
  
  "calculation": "Approximate lengths: member_1: distance(0,0)-(2,0)=2; member_2:(2,0)-(6,0)=4; member_3:(2,0)-(2,2.5)=2.5; member_4:(2,2.5)-(0,0)=≈3.201; member_5:(2,2.5)-(6,0)=≈4.72. Mass=Σ length*area_factor. Using area_id 1=0.195, 2=0.782,3=1.759.Note mass ≈ (2*0.195)+(4*1.759)+(2.5*0.782)+(3.201*0.782)+(4.72*0.195)=0.39 +7.036 +1.955 +2.504 +0.920~12.8 <30. Expected stress reduction via area increment for member_2 from 1 to 3 reduces stress by factor 1.75 approx, falling within ±15.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Proposed simplified 4 node truss removes zero stress members, improves stress distribution, uses adequate member areas, and has mass well below 30. Load and support nodes fixed as per input. Final structure meets constraints.",
