    "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss with given load/support nodes, ensure stress ≤ ±15 and mass ≤ 30.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 downward-left, supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current max stress 24.86 > 15, total mass ~21.4 < 30. Need lower stress by improving load path and member sizing.",

    "analysis": "Current design's max stress exceeds limit mainly in member_4 (node_4-node_5). Members with low area struggle with load. Mass is under limit, allowing modest area increases or structural topology improvement. Nodes 1,2,3 fixed due to supports/load. Node_4 and node_5 positions do not create efficient force paths. Member_7 has high compressive stress, suggesting load path to node_1 is overloaded. Limited number of members creates stress concentration",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing stress by adding node for load distribution and adding bracings to limit bending/moment. Increase cross-section area selectively for critical members to keep below stress limit but avoid high mass. Adjust node_5 closer to node_2 for direct load transfer. Remove member_7 (node_5 to node_1) may reduce redundant load path causing compression peaks.",

    "proposal": "Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 unchanged. Add node_6 to redistribute loads near node_5, reposition node_5 closer to node_2 at (4.9,2.1). Connect node_3 to node_6, node_5 to node_6, and node_6 to node_2, improve triangular bracing to reduce stress. Remove member_7 (node_5-node_1). Select cross-sectional areas based on calculated member bone stress and length fit to keep max stress ≤ 15.",

    "reasoning": "Adding node_6 (at ~4.9,1.8) closer to critical load zone will reduce member_lenght and stress on node_4-node_5-member path. Triangulated bracing using members [node_3-node_6, node_5-node_6, node_6-node_2] improves stability. Removal of node_5-node_1 avoids load in high compress compressive state. Area selection driven by stress/length ratio ensures members carry load without stress limits violation and no excessive mass increase.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths, approximate forces assuming linear axial behavior, area selection from 0 to 3 to keep mass ≤30 and stress ≤15. Nodes fixed: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Move node_5 (4.9,2.1), add node_6(4.9,1.8). Members as per proposal. Estimate member lengths, areas, stresses with simplified statics.",

                   "L_4(4-5) = ~1.49, L_5(5-2) = sqrt((6-4.9)^2 + (0-2.1)^2) = ~2.3, \n"

                   "L_9(5-6)=0.3, L_10(6-2)= sqrt((6-4.9)^2 + (0-1.8)^2) = ~2.1\n"
                   "Select areas:\n"
                   "members near load and supports (connections with node_2 and node_3) need larger area 3 (1.759), others 2 (0.782) or 1 (0.195) where forces are less.\n"
                   "Sum mass ~20, max stress with improved load paths estimated under ±15.\n"
                   "This keeps mass limit below 30; expected max stress reduced due to better force distribution.",
                   
    "scratch_pad_final": "Check members for duplicate connection: none. Member_7 removed to avoid compressive overstress. Node positions preserve load/support fixed nodes unchanged.
