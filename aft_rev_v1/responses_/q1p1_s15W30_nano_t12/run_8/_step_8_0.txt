  "preamble": "Optimize truss under diagonal load at node_3 with given supports and nodes.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 (-10, -45deg), pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Constraints: max stress ±15, max mass 30. Current max stress 30.3 > 15, mass 24.6 < 30.",
  "analysis": "High tensile stress (~30) in member_9 (node_5-node_6) exceeds allowable ±15 stress. Node_6 creates a short, heavily stressed member_9. Existing members connecting node_4 and node_5 have stress 18.2 (too high). Mass is okay but stress not. Some members have unnecessarily large area indices (3,2) possibly overmassive or inducing stress concentrations.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce peak stresses, simplify top triangle by removing node_6. Increase redundancy connecting node_4 and node_5 to better distribute load paths. Possibly tweak heights of intermediate nodes to balance axial forces. Use moderate cross section areas (like area id 2 or 3) where tension/compression is significant but avoid very small areas if that causes high stress. Directly connect the load node_3 to supports with triangulation to reduce moment arms and max stress.",
  "proposal": "Remove node_6. Node_1, node_2, and load node_3 fixed positions. Maintain node_4 close vertically above node_3 at (3.0, 2.2). Add node_5 near midpoint between node_4 and node_2 at (4.5,1.8). Connect: member_1: node_1-node_3 area 3; member_2: node_3-node_2 area 3; member_3: node_3-node_4 area 2; member_4: node_4-node_5 area 2; member_5: node_5-node_2 area 3; member_6: node_4-node_1 area 2; member_7: node_5-node_1 area 1; member_8: node_4-node_2 area 1. This triangulated structure without node_6 reduces critical short members, spreads loads, and uses moderate cross sections staying within max mass.",
  "reasoning": "Removing node_6 reduces overstressed member_9. The new layout keeps geometry conducive for triangulation and transfer of load from node_3 direct to supports. Cross sections balanced to decrease member stresses below ±15 limitation. Adding node_5 on the upper chord away from node_4 gives longer members and reduces stress concentration. Members connected to corners employ area sizes (1 to 3) to maintain stress capacity and light weight.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Estimated lengths: node_1-node_3 ~2.0m, node_3-node_2 ~4.0m, node_3-node_4 ~2.5m; node_4-node_5 ~1.58m; node_5-node_2 ~2.24m; node_4-node_1 ~3.7m; node_5-node_1 ~5.30m; node_4-node_2 ~3.6m. Sum lengths*area simulates mass ~ below 30. Max stress reduced by better triangulation and elimination of short weak member.",
  "calculation": "Mass approx: member_1: 2.0*1.759(area 3)=3.51; member_2: 4.0*1.759=7.04; member_3: 2.5*0.782=1.96; member_4:1.58*0.782=1.24; member_5:2.24*1.759=3.94; member_6:3.7*0.782=2.90; member_7:5.3*0.195=1.03; member_8:3.6*0.195=0.70. Total ~22.4 < 30. Max stresses expected <15 based on load distribution and member sizes.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Check no member stress over limit ±15, mass <30, no duplicate nodes or members, node positions preserved for load/support, and members rational. Node_1 at (0,0), node_2 at (6,0), node_3 at (2,0) fixed by instructions. Node_4 and node_5 positioned for better triangulation. No node_6 or any other node added.",
