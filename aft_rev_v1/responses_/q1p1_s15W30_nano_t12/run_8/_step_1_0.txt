  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss for load at node_3 with stress and mass constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load applies 10 at -45°, nodes 1 and 2 supported. Current max stress slightly exceeds -15. Limit mass under 30. Original design uses 4 nodes, 5 members all with area 2 (0.782 cross section). Mass is 11.965, stress just above limit at member_1.",
  
  "analysis": "Current structure has max compressive stress marginally exceeding allowed -15 at member_1. Total mass is well below max allowed. Members use medium sectional area (2). Stress concentration at member_1 and some redundancy in member_5 (diag from node_4 to node_2). Potential to reduce stress by rearranging to more favorable angle members and reducing length or area of highly stressed members.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce stress at member_1, preserve support and loading nodes, consider adding node between node_1 and node_3 or change geometry of node_4 to alter force transfer. Use varying cross-sectional areas to reduce mass and remove overstress. Possibly slightly raising node_4 or adding an intermediate node to spread load paths.",
  
  "proposal": "Add 1 intermediate node between node_1 and node_4 to better distribute load. Adjust node_4 position upwards for better truss shape. Adjust member areas: reduce around low-stress members to smaller sizes, increase selected areas on higher stress members within limits. Try: Move node_4 to (2.0, 3.0), add node_5 at (1.0, 1.5). Members connecting node_4 -> node_5, node_5 -> node_1, node_5 -> node_3. Use larger area for members taking compression or high force.",
  
  "reasoning": "Elevation of node_4 increases leverage and changes force angles thus reducing axial force in highly stressed members. Adding node_5 creates more trapezoidal shape, distributing load better and mitigating compressive peak. Using mixed areas optimizes mass usage: smaller area for low load tension members, larger for compressive compression and tension members.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Check length and angle of new members, calculate member forces using basic truss statics, verify member stresses using force/area relation. Target areas per stress: member stress/ allowable stress * reference area 2 (0.782). Avoid oversizing to keep mass under 30.",
  
  "calculation": "Positions: node_1(0.0, 0.0), node_2(6.0,0.0), node_3(2.0,0.0), node_4(2.0,3.0), node_5(1.0,1.5).\nMembers:\nmember_1: node_1-node_3 length 2.0m\nmember_2: node_3-node_2 length 4.0m\nmember_3: node_3-node_4 length sqrt(3²) = 3.0m\nmember_4: node_4-node_1 length sqrt( (2-0)² + (3-0)²) = 3.605m\nmember_5: node_4-node_2 length sqrt( (6-2)² +3²) = 5.0m\nmember_6: node_4-node_5 length sqrt( (2-1)² + (3-1.5)²) = 1.802m\nmember_7: node_5-node_1 length sqrt( (1-0)² + (1.5-0)²) = 1.803m\nmember_8: node_5-node_3 length sqrt( (2-1)² + (0-1.5)² )=1.803m\nAssign areas based on approximate stress (lower for short tension; higher for compression)\n- member_1: area 3 (1.759), largest compressive load expected\n- member_2: area 1 (0.195), less stressed\n- member_3: area 2 (0.782)\n- member_4: area 3 (1.759)\n- member_5: area 2 (0.782)\n- member_6: area 2 (0.782)\n- member_7: area 1 (0.195)\n- member_8: area 2 (0.782)\nMass approx = Σ L*area\n= 2*1.759 + 4*0.195 + 3*0.782 + 3.605*1.759 + 5*0.782 + 1.802*0.782 + 1.803*0.195 + 1.803*0.782\n≈ 3.518 + 0.78 + 2.346 + 6.34 + 3.91 + 1.41 + 0.351 + 1.41 = total ~ 19.56 < 30\nStress estimates expected to be reduced on member_1 due to load re-distribution facilitating meeting ±15 constraint.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Structure expected to satisfy mass and max ±15 constraints, nodal positions fixed for load/support with added node only in allowed region. Mixed member areas optimize weight and strength balance. Eliminate overstress by geometry and section optimization.",
