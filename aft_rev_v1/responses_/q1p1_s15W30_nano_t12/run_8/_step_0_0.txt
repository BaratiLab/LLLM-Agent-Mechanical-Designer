  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss with given nodes, loads, supports minimizing stress within mass and stress constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given 3 nodes (one under diagonal downward load), pinned + roller supports at ends. Minimize max tensile/compressive stress ±15, mass ≤30, maintain closed truss (all nodes connected).",
  
  "analysis": "Original nodes: node_1 (0,0 pinned), node_2 (6,0 roller), node_3 (2,0) loaded with -10 at -45°. Initial model is a single span with a downward diagonal load. A closed truss means all nodes connected mutually, any intermediate supports & triangulations needed. Current layout is line on x-axis; need vertical offsets or additional nodes to form triangles for stable, statically determinate solutions with low stress. Load at node_3 creates bending and axial load in members from this node to supports.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Must not move existing nodes. Can add minimal nodes if needed. Best is to add a node above node_3 for triangulation (forming 2 triangles). Choose node_4 above node_3 to create stable 2-triangle pentagon shape. Stress will be axial on members without bending. Cross force vectors precisely with load to reduce member stress. Use minimal cross sectional areas fitting stress and mass limits.",
  
  "reasoning": "Stress = Force / Area, force depends on load and geometry. Mass = sum(length × area). To reduce stress with minimal mass: maintain short members, use thicker areas on highest force members, thinner on low forces. Triangles distribute load better and prevent bending moments. Introducing node_4 above node_3 at (2.0, h), h >0, to form adequate triangles. Forces resolve into axial for simplicity. Estimate forces assuming linear statics. Use areas from library to comply max stress. Set h to minimal height ~2.0 to reduce length (thus mass) but provide lever arm for load resolution.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Forces: Load at node_3 is 10 units at 45 degrees downward-left (vector components Fx=-7.07 N, Fy=-7.07 N). Members: from node_1 to node_3 (horizontal), node_2 to node_3 (horizontal), introducing node_4 at (2,2.0). Add members node_3-node_4, node_4-node_1, node_4-node_2, invstgap aims to convert load and balance sums of Fx=0, Fy=0. Calculate tension/compression on each member using method of joints and approximate axial forces. Use cross-sectional areas to keep stress ≤15. Calculate mass from length×area. Keep total mass ≤30. Check closed condition: all nodes connected via sequence of members.",
