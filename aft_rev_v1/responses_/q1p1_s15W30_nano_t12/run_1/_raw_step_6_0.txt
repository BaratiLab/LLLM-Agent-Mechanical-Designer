Nodes at supports and load are fixed. Member areas and node positions optimize stress within limits.",\n\n  "analysis": "Given iteration 5 shows all member stresses within ±15 and total mass under 30, current topology with four nodes and five members is efficient. Node 4 is raised to 3.5 to balance forces, achieving max stress 14.21, improved from previous higher stresses. Existing member area \'2\' balances mass and strength effectively.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "No members exceed allowable stress; mass is well below max, so no need for further fingerprinting or major geometry changes. Adding members or nodes may complicate and increase mass without stress benefit.",\n\n  "reasoning": "To minimize stress, symmetrical force paths and balanced member lengths are beneficial. Current node 4 height 3.5 appears optimal between manageable length and load distribution. All node positions except load and support nodes optimized. Further node movements risking supports forbidden. Member areas of \'2\' moderately sized, adequate for load, not causing excess mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Total mass calculated as sum(length * area). Largest compressive stress is member 1 (-14.2), tensile ~8 (member 3). Both safe. Member cross sections not changed from \'2\' because increasing would add mass; decreasing risky for stress. No lower stress uncovered as areas vs mass tradeoff fine.",\n\n  "calculation": "Current max stress = 14.21 (within ±15). Total mass 14.75 < 30. Node positions at 3.5 height optimal. No large stress imbalances suggesting internal force redistribution needed. Cross-sectional area \'2\' maintains balance. No violations identified. Stress spread acceptable; slight tensile in some members, compressive in others as expected.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met safely, structure is minimal complexity (closed truss), stress optimization nearing limit given current fixed boundaries.
