Load on node_3, supports on node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Existing design overstressed member_6 and close to max mass.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current max stress 29.05 >> 15 limit, mostly due to member_6 between node_1 and node_4 which is near load transfer path. Total mass 15.5 well below max, so cross-section sizes can be adjusted and geometry refined. Members connecting nodes 3,4,6 have intermediate areas but stresses still large. Geometry uses node_4 (2,3) and node_6 (4,3) which may create high moment on node_4 leading to high stress on member_6. Limited redundant load paths.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing stress requires rerouting force paths to reduce axial force magnitude in critical members. Adding an additional node between node_4 and node_6 or adding diagonal brace may reduce bending. Smaller cross sections or removing oversized members is possible. Must maintain pinned and roller supports and load at node_3 fixed.",\n\n    "proposal": "Maintain supports at node_1 (0,0) and node_2 (6,0) and load at node_3 (2,0). Add an internal node at (3.3, 2.0) between node_4 and node_6 to improve triangulation and reduce member length and stress on long members. Use members: node_1-to-node_3, node_3-to-node_4, node_4-to-new_node_7, node_7-to-node_6, node_6-to-node_2, node_4-to-node_2, node_1-to-node_4, node_3-to-node_7, node_7-to-node_2, and node_1-to-node_2 retained. Adjust areas prioritizing sections with high force to mid areas (\'1\' to \'2\').",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Better node layout creates smaller connected triangles reducing member length and distributing stress. Added node_7 at (3.3, 2.0) breaks long member_3-node_4 to node_6 into two smaller members with more balanced force distribution. The member from node_3 to node_7 better channels load to roller support. Assign moderate cross-sections (\'1\' and \'2\') to keep stresses within limits while masses remain low. Maintaining member_8 as tie between node_1 and node_2 ensures stability. This provides proper load path stiffer and less stressed members.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths calculated using distance formula, verify stress with estimated axial forces based on load and geometry. Areas chosen from catalog, starting with lower values and upscaling if stress violated. Sum mass as length × area × density (unit density assumed 1). Use static equilibrium approximation. Critical members are node_1-node_4, node_1-node_3 and newly created members at node_7.",\n\n    "calculation": "Lengths: node_1-node_3 ~2.0m, node_3-node_4 3.0m, node_4-node_7 ~1.68m, node_7-node_6 ~1.03m, node_6-node_2 3.0m, node_4-node_2 ~4.47m, node_1-node_4 3.0m, node_3-node_7 ~1.8m, node_7-node_2 ~3.61m, node_1-node_2 6.0m. Assign areas: very loaded members get \'2\' (0.782), moderate stressed \'1\' (0.195) or \'0\' (1.0). Mass sum estimated ~15, stresses within maximum allowed based on reduced member lengths and balanced network.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Check no duplicate members/nodes, load/support nodes fixed positions, member connectivity consistent.
