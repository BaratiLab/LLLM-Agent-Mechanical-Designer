Nodes for load/support fixed except node_4 moved from prior position. Areas mostly 2 and 3.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress near 15 is member_1 (-14.69). This member is in compression, connecting node_1 (fixed at 0,0) to node_3 (2,0). Members connected to node_4 have moderate stresses. The structure is a closed quadrilateral with diagonal tie (member_5). To reduce max stress, must redistribute load by changing node_4 position to balance forces. Also, review area sizes can reduce to lower mass but must stay within stress limits. Node_3 fixed at x=2 (load point). Increase height at node_4 possibly to reduce compression in member_1 by improving truss action.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on modest increase in y of node_4 to increase flexure capacity. Maintain x of node_4 close to around 3 to keep geometry stable. Possibly reduce areas for members with low stress (members 4 & 5 currently at area 3 and 2). Reduce member_3 from area 3 to 2 status if stress allows.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "1) Moving node_4 vertically upward can lower compressive stress on member_1 by redistributing forces to members connecting node_4. 2) Using smaller cross sectional area on members with low stress can reduce overall mass without causing constraint violations. 3) Member_5 stress is low (-2.82), area 2 likely can remain. 4) Member_3 has moderate tensile stress 3.6, could try area 2 instead of 3. 5) Member_4 low tensile 1.8, area 3 possibly reducible to 2 as well. 6) We\'ll keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. 7) We\'ll increase node_4 y from 3.2 to about 3.5 for better load path.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths from updated node_4.
