Original structure stress violations at members 2,4,6; needs better force distribution in truss members.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The original design with four nodes and six members has members with high tensile/compressive stress (-36.26, ±30), violating ±15 limit. Bonding point node_4 appears too close to node_3 creating long, highly stressed diagonal members. The total mass (~7.9) is less than limit but stresses are high. Load on node_3 is -10 units at -45°, producing both vertical and horizontal components, creating complex force flow. Present design lacks sufficient triangulation or alternate compression paths.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, add a node near midpoint between node_3 and node_2 along y>0 line to balance load. Increase area of main tension/compression members. Use smaller areas on less stressed members to keep mass low. Introduce two additional diagonal members to distribute forces effectively.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add one new node \'node_5\' above node_3 and closer towards node_2 around (3.7,1.7). Connect members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_5-node_4, node_4-node_1, node_1-node_2 (base), node_4-node_2, and node_3-node_2. Assign areas focusing higher areas on main load path members to reduce stress (e.g., 4 or 5). This triangulated form better distributes forces reducing max stress below ±15 and keeps total mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding \'node_5\' improves force redirection from loaded node_3 to support node_2 by increasing triangulation points and reducing stretching/compression length for diagonals. Increasing cross-section areas of load-bearing members lowers stress. Using smaller areas on auxiliary members saves mass. The node positions are precise to avoid redundancy and maintain structural stability. Connections ensure no duplicate members, all supports and loads fixed. The configuration mimics classic stable truss bridges with diagonal bracing, stabilizing load path.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Length and area estimation for mass; stress reassessment considering areas and member orientations; main load path: node_3 to node_5, node_5 to node_2 and to node_4, distributing forces. Use area \'4\' for major members (~3.128), reduce stress effectively; smaller areas (1 or 0.195) for bracing members. Member connectivity: eight members total to improve redundancy and structural integrity.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Lengths: node_1-node_2 = 6m, node_1-node_3 = 2m, node_3-node_5 ≈ sqrt((3.7-2)^2 + (1.7-0)^2)=~2.1m, node_5-node_2 ≈ sqrt((6-3.7)^2 + (0-1.7)^2)=~3.06m, node_5-node_4 ≈ sqrt((3.7-2)^2 + (1.7-2.5)^2)=~1.23m, node_4-node_1=≈sqrt((2-0)^2+(2.5-0)^2)=3.2016m, node_4-node_2=√((6-2)^2+(0-2.5)^2)=~4.72m, node_3-node_2=4m.
