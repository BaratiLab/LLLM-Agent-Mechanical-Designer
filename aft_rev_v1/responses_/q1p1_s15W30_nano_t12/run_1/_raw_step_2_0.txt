Current structure exceeds max stress and mass of members mostly from large area indices (3, 4). Adjustment needed in geometry and area selection.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Currently, node_5 at (3.7,1.7) connects multiple members with large stress (member_5 max tensile 64.7) and large mass members (areas \'3\' and \'4\') cause total mass >40. The direct horizontal base (member_1, node_1-node_2) is area \'0\' with length 6m which contributes significant mass. Several members connect long distances driving up mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Removing node_5 or relocating it closer to concentrated force path can reroute forces better. Adding a node higher than node_4 can improve load paths. Reassigning cross-sectional areas to smaller or more suitable profiles is critical. Use triangulation for structural stability.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Maintain nodes_1, 2, 3 (fixed). Remove node_5, shift node_4 slightly upward to (2.0, 3.0) for better triangulation. Add node_6 at (4.0, 3.0) creating more triangles to spread load. Connect members as following: node_1-node_3 (area 2), node_3-node_4 (area 2), node_4-node_6 (area 1), node_6-node_2 (area 2), node_4-node_2 (area 1), node_1-node_4 (area 1), node_3-node_6 (area 1), node_1-node_2 (area 0) as baseline. This increases triangulation and reduces high stress concentration. Use mostly areas 1 or 2 to reduce mass but large force members use 2.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular configurations minimize bending, redistribute load paths and reduce peak stresses. Shorter members with smaller cross-section and using area codes 1 or 2 reduces mass under threshold. Elevated node_4 and extra node_6 help form multiple load paths avoiding single member overload. Base member uses minimal area \'0\' for weight savings.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths and weighted masses: key length member_1 =6m, so mass=6*1=6; other members are shorter ~2-3 m, multiplied by 0.195 - 0.782 area yields moderate mass. Ensure max stress remains below 15 by triangulated load path sharing force.
