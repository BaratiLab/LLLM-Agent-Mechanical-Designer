Max stress ±15, max mass 30. Current design over stress limit on member_2 (-32.67) with total mass 15.35 < 30, so stress violation dominates need redesign/change in member areas and topology.",\n\n  "analysis": "Member stresses indicate member_2 in high compression (-32.67) beyond constraint. Current member areas mostly 1,2 or 3. Member_4 area 3 (1.759) still too stressed. The truss configuration insufficient to carry load stress within limit. Node_4 position shifting alone insufficient to reduce compression high stress in member_2. Load at node_3 spot suggests need of additional structuring or node repositioning near load to reduce force concentration.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce tensile/compression beyond ±15, possibly add or reposition nodes to redistribute forces. Increasing area in overstressed member beyond current max 3 also possible if mass constraint not violated. However, smarter topology may reduce mass and redistribute stress better.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add node_5 nearer between node_3 and node_4 to create redundant paths to reduce compression stress on member_2. Connect node_5 to node_1, node_3, node_4 with moderate member areas. Assign areas with consideration to members carrying higher stress to reduce forces. Keep load/support nodes fixed. Recalculate masses and stresses for design within constraints.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Adding node closer to loaded node redistributes compression centrifugal forces lowering demands on single members. Connections from support node_1 to node_5 and from node_5 to node_3 and node_4 form a truss triangle and better load paths to reduce max compressive stress on member_2. Area sizing from given discrete options used to keep mass under 30 total. Members bearing higher force get larger areas. Members with lower force are sized smaller to save mass.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Areas available [\'0\':1.0 (max light), \'1\':0.195 (light), \'2\':0.782 (med), \'3\':1.759 (med-large)]. Currently member_2 (node_1-node_4) heavily stressed so increase area up to 3 or redesign around it. Member count increase compensated by smaller area to keep mass <30. Precise node coordinates used to minimize member lengths. Member_1 (node_1-node_2) can have moderate area as support roller stiffens. Member lengths to be computed for total mass check.",\n\n  "calculation": "Placed node_5 at approximately (2.4, 1.6) to split load. Reassigned members: member_5 (node_1-node_5), member_6 (node_5-node_3), member_7 (node_5-node_4). Assigned areas favor: member_2 area increased to \'3\' for compression. member_4 reduced to \'2\' as less force.
