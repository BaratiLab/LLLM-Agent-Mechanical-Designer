Current design mass 40.56, above max; max stress 9.23 ok but mass excessive.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current design exceeds mass limit (40.56 > 30). Max stress is within limits. Load applies on node_3 only; supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller fixed. Nodes include upper nodes (node_4, node_6) creating heavy top chords with large member areas. Closely spaced nodes reduce leverage but add mass. Main issue is large total mass and member_7 with largest individual mass.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_6 to reduce height and member length, reduce top chord area, simplify the truss geometry. Rebalance members to handle load efficiently, possibly add one auxiliary node between node_3 and node_4 to form triangular bracing with smaller members focusing on load path to supports.",\n\n  "proposal": "Remove node_6. Use nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (2.7, 3.4), and add node_5 at (3.3,1.7). Connect members: node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_3-node_5, node_4-node_5. Assign areas lower, mostly area_id \'2\' and some \'1\' or \'0\' on less stressed members.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Removing highest nodes and largest members reduces overall mass drastically. Adding one intermediate node (node_5) adds additional bracing, enabling smaller area members. Using mainly area_id \'2\' (0.782) and down sized members on limited tension/compression paths ensures mass keeps under limit. The truss remains stable with triangular substructures, controlling stresses within constraint. Keep load and support nodes fixed; new nodes optimized for minimal length and load transfer.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculations: node_1 to node_3 = 2.0m, node_2 to node_3 = 4.0m, node_1 to node_4 = ~4.40m, node_2 to node_4 = ~4.40m, node_3 to node_4 = ~3.4m, node_3 to node_5 = ~1.56m, node_4 to node_5 = ~1.91m. Mass = sum(length × area_const × density_factor). Target total under 30. Max stress with moderate member diameters under load calculated to remain under ±15 MPa given load, with tight bracing controlling deformation.",\n\n  "calculation": "Length(member_1) = 2.0, area_id=3->1.759, mass_1=3.518; reducing area to 2=>0.782 mass=1.564, better. Similarly assigned areas: member_3 and member_4 as 2, members spanning bottom nodes (members_1 and member_2) as 2 also; short bracing members with area 1 (0.195). After recalculating, total mass ~22-25, under limit. Max stresses estimated below 15.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "No duplications, nodes fixed on support/load, new node_5 optimizes internal bracing, member areas optimized to minimize mass under stress limit.
