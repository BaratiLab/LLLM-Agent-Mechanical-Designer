  "preamble": "Minimizing max stress, adjusting members and node 4; respecting load/support fixed nodes.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current structure has max stress 13.1 < 15 and mass 11.94 < 30 is feasible. Node_3 fixed at x=2, y=0 (load), nodes 1,2 fixed support. Node_4 at (3,3) mostly contributes to stress in member_4 (13.1). Areas: member_1-2,member_2-2,member_3-2,member_4-1. Member 4 under tension near limit at 13.1.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_4 stress is highest, area smallest (1). Increase area or adjust node_4 to reduce member_4 stress. member_2 stress zero, could reduce area there. member_1 and member_3 tension & compression significant but within limits. Suggest shift node_4 upward and slightly toward node_3 to balance member length and reduce member_4 stress peak while reducing area or combined small area of member_2.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Increase member_4 area from 1 to say 2/3, reduce member_2 area to maybe 1 (0.195) since stress is zero. Move node_4 from (3.0, 3.0) to maybe (2.7, 3.4) to decrease length&stress of member_4 while preserving closed truss. Keep total mass ≤ 30. Reducing area of member_2 frees mass for member_4 area increase.",
  
  "reasoning": "Reducing zero stress member area reduces weight slightly, allowed by constraint. Increasing area in member_4 with high stress reduces stress ratio favorably. Shifting node_4 dirección to equalize member stress works, bring it closer along vector from node_3 to node_4 to decrease forcings. New geometry chosen respecting fixed nodes 1,2,3. Use closed truss by connecting nodes (1,2,4) and (1,4), and (2,4), adding all necessary members.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Areas now: member_1: 2, member_2: 1 (0.195 area), member_3: 2, member_4: 3 (1.759) or 2(0.782). Calculate effect on stress, smaller stress ~ improved margin. Lengths change due to node_4 shift: member_4 shorter length, less stress likely. Total mass recalculated sum(length * area). Constraints check to be satisfied before finalize.",

  "calculation": "Move node_4 to (2.7, 3.4) from (3.0,3.0). area member_4 increased from 1 to 3 (1.759). Reduce area member_2 from 2(0.782) to 1(0.195). Others unchanged. New lengths approx: L(member_4) = sqrt((2.7-2)^2 + (3.4-0)^2) ≈ restate approx 3.468 shorter than previous 3.0~3.2, so stress lowered. member_2 decrease saved weight; member_4 increased improved stress capacity; overall total mass under 30. Estimated updated max stress ~10.5-12 <15. Confirm configuration feasible.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "No duplication in members, nodes 1,2,3 fixed. Closed truss remains with node_4 connected to 1,2,3 maintaining stability. Rebalancing area benefits stress margin without mass breach.",
