  "preamble": "Refining truss nodal placement within constraints to reduce max stress.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 13.83 < 15 allowed, total mass 15.23 < 30 limit, stable truss structure with 5 nodes and 7 members. Load at node_3, supports fixed.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress lies mainly in member_1 (-13.8294), close to the limit. Node_5 position at (3.0, 1.5) and node_4 fixed at (2.7, 3.4). Small shifts in node_5 can change force distribution and member stresses. Members with zero or near zero stress imply local underutilization; may improve stress distribution by moving node_5 slightly upwards and closer to node_4, balancing forces and minimizing peak stress.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_1 and node_2 fixed due to support. Node_3 fixed due to load application. Minor vertical or horizontal adjustment of node_5 can transfer forces more evenly and potentially reduce maximum stress.",
  
  "reasoning": "Stress concentrated in member_1 suggests high load transfer there. Raising node_5 (currently 3.0, 1.5) slightly upwards and towards node_4 leverages compression-tension interaction. Keep area assignments same for constraint adherence. Avoid heavy vertical displacement to prevent mass increase. Check impact on member lengths to maintain mass <30. Preserve topology since structure remains stable and closed.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Small delta_y for node_5 (e.g. +0.4) and delta_x (-0.2) may reduce stress concentration. Re-assess member lengths (~L and stresses ~stress ~ load / area / length). Area IDs remain unchanged due to instructions not changing areas. Slight repositioning impacts load path favorably.",
  
  "calculation": "Change node_5 from (3.0,1.5) to (2.8,1.9). This moves node_5 slightly closer vertically to node_4 (2.7,3.4), a 0.4m vertical raise and 0.2m shift left, better geometry for load transfer. Member lengths (approx.): m6 (node_3-node_5) ~ from sqrt((2-3)^2+(0-1.5)^2)=1.80m to sqrt((2-2.8)^2+(0-1.9)^2)=1.97m (+0.17m), marginal mass increase (~0.03) assuming area 1=0.195. Member_7 (node_4-node_5) from sqrt(0.3^2+1.9^2)=1.925m to sqrt((2.7-2.8)^2+(3.4-1.9)^2)=1.504m decreased significantly, reducing stress in member_7 and member_6. Expected max stress decrease via improved equilibrium. Total mass remains well below 30.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New node_5 position reduces tension in member_1 by better force share via node_5. Member_7 mass contribution decreased. Updated geometry expected to lower max stress ~13.83 to below 12. Ensure no added members duplicate or nodes overlap. Changed positions precise float with no rounding artifact.",
