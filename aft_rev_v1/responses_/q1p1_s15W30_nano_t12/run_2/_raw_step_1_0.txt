Node_3 fixed at x=2, y=0 (load), nodes 1,2 fixed support. Node_4 at (3,3) mostly contributes to stress in member_4 (13.1). Areas: member_1-2,member_2-2,member_3-2,member_4-1. Member 4 under tension near limit at 13.1.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_4 stress is highest, area smallest (1). Increase area or adjust node_4 to reduce member_4 stress. member_2 stress zero, could reduce area there. member_1 and member_3 tension & compression significant but within limits. Suggest shift node_4 upward and slightly toward node_3 to balance member length and reduce member_4 stress peak while reducing area or combined small area of member_2.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increase member_4 area from 1 to say 2/3, reduce member_2 area to maybe 1 (0.195) since stress is zero. Move node_4 from (3.0, 3.0) to maybe (2.7, 3.4) to decrease length&stress of member_4 while preserving closed truss. Keep total mass ≤ 30. Reducing area of member_2 frees mass for member_4 area increase.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Reducing zero stress member area reduces weight slightly, allowed by constraint. Increasing area in member_4 with high stress reduces stress ratio favorably. Shifting node_4 dirección to equalize member stress works, bring it closer along vector from node_3 to node_4 to decrease forcings. New geometry chosen respecting fixed nodes 1,2,3.

New lengths approx: L(member_4) = sqrt((2.7-2)^2 + (3.4-0)^2) ≈ restate approx 3.468 shorter than previous 3.0~3.2, so stress lowered. member_2 decrease saved weight; member_4 increased improved stress capacity; overall total mass under 30.
