Highly stressed member_5 between node_1 and node_3 causes failure. The load direction (-10 N at -45° on node_3) creates tensile force beyond allowable limits on member_5.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_5 has minimal cross-section (area_id 1 = 0.195), but still overstressed. Need to reduce stress on member_5 by adding support or redistributing load. Current node_6 at (2.0,1.75) helps but insufficient. Adding additional nodes or members to create stronger load paths will reduce stress. Existing support and load node positions are fixed.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add a new node (node_7) above node_3 to form a truss web, linking node_7 to node_1 and node_2. Increase area for critical members. Remove direct member_1-node_3 if replaced by stronger truss web. Reorganize members to triangular and vertical forms to distribute forces and reduce max stresses.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Triangulated systems efficiently distribute loads and reduce member stresses. Adding node_7 at about (3.0, 2.5) forms two triangles: node_1-node_7-node_3 and node_3-node_7-node_2. Members node_1-node_7 and node_7-node_2 will carry load sharing tension/compression. Node_6 at (2.0,1.75) remains to support node_3 and spread forces. Use moderate to large cross sections on high force members after verifying length and stress. Remove or reduce smallest area member between node_1 and node_3 so high stress there is alleviated. Members connecting to node_7 form multiple load paths.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_1-node_7 ~ sqrt(3^2+2.5^2)≈3.905, node_2-node_7 ~ sqrt(3^2+(2.5)^2)=3.905, node_7-node_3 ~ sqrt(1^2+(2.5-0)^2)= approx 2.692, node_1-node_6= sqrt(2^2+1.75^2)=2.672, node_6-node_3=1.75, node_6-node_2= sqrt(4^2+1.75^2)=4.33, node_3-node_2=4.0. Assign areas to members with higher length/load to limit stress: e.g. node_1-node_7 (area 4.887), node_7-node_2 (area 4.887), node_7-node_3 (area 3.128), node_6-node_2 (area 3.128), node_1-node_6 (area 1.759), node_6-node_3 (area 1.759), node_3-node_2 (area 0.782).

Current sum exceeds 30, so reduce heavier members via area: reduce node_6-node_2 to area 2=0.782, member_4 mass=4.33*0.782=3.39; node_1-node_7 and node_7-node_2 set area to 3=1.759, mass each = 3.905*1.759=6.87 each; node_7-node_3 area=2=0.782, mass=2.692*0.782=2.1. Sum mass now approx 4.7+3.07+3.128+3.39+6.87+6.87+2.1=30.13 (slightly high, reduce node_1-node_6 area to 1=0.195, 2.672*0.195=0.52). New total ~26 mass, acceptable.
