Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Stress max ±20; mass <=30. Existing max stress 107+ exceeds limit; mass 19.5 under max limit. Need better force flow and member sizing.",\n  "analysis": "High compression in member_6 (node_3-node_6) at -107 indicates overstress. Lightweight member_6 area=1 insufficient. Area assignments cause imbalance. Load on node_3 diagonal downward left demands strong bracing. Current structure lacks triangulation near load. Member_7 (node_1-node_4) area=3 under-utilized. Node_6 is low and near node_3; better node positioning and top chord members needed to distribute stresses. Member_5 (node_5-node_3) weak area=1 and stressed high.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress, strengthen highly stressed members (member_6, member_5), improve triangulation and load transfer paths. Consider moving node_6 left and slightly higher, adding additional node between node_4 and node_5 for better force distribution. Use higher area for highly stressed members and reduce unnecessary large members to keep mass below 30.",\n  "proposal": "Adjust node_6 to (1.4,1.9) up and left to improve geometry; add node_7 at (3.5,1.8) between node_4 and node_5 for subdivision. Redefine members to form well-triangulated chains: node_1-node_6(area=3), node_6-node_4(area=2), node_4-node_7(area=2), node_7-node_5(area=1), node_5-node_2(area=3), node_5-node_3(area=2), node_3-node_6(area=3), node_3-node_2(area=2), node_1-node_4(area=2). Remove member_7 from prev design. This improves force paths and balances stress. Areas selected to limit stress and minimize mass.",\n  "reasoning": "Increasing area of node_3-node_6 from 1 to 3 reduces compression stress there; triangulation via new node_7 relieves load on node_5. Longer members get smaller area to reduce mass, short highly loaded members are bigger. Supports stay fixed. Geometry modified slightly for more ideal force flow. Member count 9 is acceptable. All members connected distinctly without duplicates.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths and masses for each member with new geometry and area ids. Ensure sum mass <=30 and max stress <=20. Check if diagonal members shorten to reduce stress. Updated node positions maintain structural coherence.",\n  "calculation": "Lengths (approx): node_1-node_6: sqrt((1.4)^2+(1.9)^2)=2.36 m; member mass = 2.36*0.782=1.85; node_6-node_4: sqrt((2.5-1.4)^2+(1.75-1.9)^2)=1.11m; mass=1.11*0.195=0.216; node_4-node_7: sqrt((3.5-2.5)^2+(1.8-1.75)^2)=1.0m; mass=1.0*0.195=0.195; node_7-node_5: sqrt((4.0-3.5)^2+(1.5-1.8)^2)=0.58m; mass=0.58*0.782=0.45; node_5-node_2: sqrt((6.0-4.0)^2+(0-1.5)^2)=2.5m; mass=2.5*0.782=1.96; node_5-node_3: sqrt((4.0-2.0)^2+(1.5-0)^2)=2.5m; mass=2.5*0.195=0.487; node_3-node_6: sqrt((2.0-1.4)^2+(0-1.9)^2)=1.98m; mass=1.98*0.782=1.55; node_3-node_2: 4.0m; mass=4.0*0.195=0.78; node_1-node_4: sqrt(2.5^2+1.75^2)=3.0m; mass=3.0*0.195=0.585.

Estimates indicate max stress <20 achievable.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "New layout ensures triangulation, load paths redistributed; higher area on critical compression and tension members.
