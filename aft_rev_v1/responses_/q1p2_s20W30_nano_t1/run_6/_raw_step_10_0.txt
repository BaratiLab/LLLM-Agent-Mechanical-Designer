Load at node_3, supports fixed. Nodes_1 and 2 fixed. Members mostly low stress but member_2 at 17.12 max tension.",\n  "analysis": "Max stress occurs at member_2 (node_5 to node_6) with area \'2\' and stress 17.12 close to limit. Member_1 and member_3 have moderate compressive stress. Member_4 zero stress. Member_8 tension 14.11. Current node_6 location and small cross-sectional area on member_2 cause peak stress. Node_5 and node_6 positions influence geometry and force paths. More balanced geometry may help reduce peak stress. Areas currently vary between 1,2,3 mostly, mass is relatively low. Potential to slightly move node_6 closer to node_5 horizontally and vertically to improve load path. Possibly reduce area of member_2 if stress reduces. Member_7 and member_6 have minor tensile/compressive stress, can be optimized if geometry adjusted. Constraints allow some margin for adjustments.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Shift node_6 slightly closer to node_5 horizontally and upward vertically to balance load. Slightly increase area on member_3 from \'2\' to \'3\' to reduce compressive stress. Member_2 area could remain \'2\' but geometry tweak might reduce stress below 15 allowing mass reduction later. Members_1 and 4 area \'3\' look acceptable. Keep member_8 area \'1\' as lower area is preferable if stress allows. Maintain closed truss shape with current members but improve triangle shape formed by nodes 3,5,6.",\n  "reasoning": "Moving node_6 from (2.8,1.3) towards (2.7,1.5) will improve load transfer from node_5 to node_3, reducing tension in member_2. Increasing member_3\'s area to \'3\' will resist compression better. With better load distribution, max tensile stress in member_2 will decrease below 17. Validating mass: Slight increase in member_3 mass offset by possible reduced stress allowing decrease of member_2 area in next iterations. Keep other members unchanged for stability. No change to load/support nodes. Use precise floats for node positions. No duplicate nodes or members introduced. The closed truss remains intact.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Current max_stress=17.12, mass=17.25 < constraints. Target max_stress <15 per rough target margin for safety. Members mass sum recalculated after area changes. Member length approx: member_2 ~ distance(node_5, node_6). Shift node_6 from (2.8,1.3) to (2.7,1.5) distance shorter or slightly different, but better angle reduces force. Member_3 length same approx (node_6 to node_3). Update member areas: member_3 from \'2\' to \'3\'. Expect member_3 stress reduced from -9.25 to around -6 to -7. Member_2 hopefully decreases to ~14-15 tensile. Max stress reduced, safer margin.",\n  "calculation": "Coordinate changes: node_6 from (2.8,1.3) to (2.7,1.5). New member lengths: member_2 length ~ sqrt((2.6-2.7)^2 + (2.1-1.5)^2)=sqrt(0.01+0.36)=0.608. Slightly shorter than before (~0.92). Member_3 length ~ sqrt((2.7-2)^2+(1.5-0)^2)=sqrt(0.49+2.25)=~1.63. Increase area member_3 from \'2\'(0.782) to \'3\'(1.759) approx double, reduces stress by factor ~0.44. Mass impact: member_3 mass doubles approx, increments member mass ~1.19 to ~2.7. Member_2 mass reduces from 0.645 to approx 0.6 due to shorter length and area stay same. Total mass ~17.3-17.5 estimate. Max stress reduces to approx tensile 15 max (on member_2).",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints remain met: max stress < 20, total mass < 30. Geometry modified only node_6 position within allowed bounds. Member areas adjusted only on member_3 increasing cross-section to accommodate compression. Members maintain closed truss integrity. Load and support nodes unchanged. Mass increase minimal. Stress distribution improved, safer limits achieved.
