    "preamble" :  "Optimize a small 2D truss with nodes fixed at base and load at node_3, minimizing stress and mass under constraints.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "3 nodes given with 2 supports fixed: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Load -10N at 45° down-left on node_3. Max stress ±20, mass sum ≤30 using area IDs from catalog.",
    "analysis": "Structure must be closed (all connected); we have three nodes at (0,0), (6,0), and (2,0) which are colinear—the loaded node_3 at (2,0) is between supports on x-axis. To form closed truss, add a node above the line to form triangle. Triangle shape is stable and minimal for three supports and load. Place new node (node_4) vertically above node_3 to resist load. Members will connect all nodes forming closed loop with diagonals to optimize force paths. Areas will be assigned to keep max stress within ±20 and mass ≤30 constraint.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2.0, h) where h chosen ~3.0 to create height. Members: node_1-node_2 (base), node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2 maybe. Simplify to closed polygon with redundant members limited. Choose areas from smallest needed to balance forces and minimize mass.",
    "reasoning": "Assumptions: Linear static analysis. Axial force only in members. Load of 10N at node_3 at 45° down-left implies compression in members connected to node_4. Tension/compression limited to 20 units. Use length for mass: length × area. Area selection guided by approximate force in members. Node_3 is loaded; triangulation stabilizes loads. Minimum members: base edge (node_1-node_2), two sides connecting to node_4, and node_3 connected to node_4 and base nodes for stability. Node_4 height chosen to optimize cross-sectional area vs force. Approximate force distribution using static equilibrium equations.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths of members: base 6m, vertical legs from node_4 to base nodes ~3.605m (sqrt((2-0)^2 + 3^2)), node_3 connections vary. Assume tension in vertical legs, compression in base. Areas selected progressively. Max stress ≤20 used to determine required area given force = stress × area. Mass sum verified by sum(length × area) ≤30.",
    "calculation": "Node locations: node_1(0.0,0.0), node_2(6.0,0.0), node_3(2.0,0.0), node_4(2.0,3.0). Members: m1(node_1-node_2): length=6.0m; m2(node_1-node_4): length=3.605m; m3(node_2-node_4): length=4.123m; m4(node_3-node_4): length=3.0m; m5(node_1-node_3): length=2.0m; m6(node_3-node_2): length=4.0m. Assume force in members roughly proportional to member orientation resisting load. Max expected force ~10N, max stress 20 → min area= force/stress=10/20=0.5. Use area=0.782 (area_id '2') for critical members, area=0.195 (area_id '1') for base small tension members to save mass. Mass sum approximately: m1: 6*0.195=1.17, m2:3.605*0.782=2.82, m3:4.123*0.782=3.22, m4:3*0.782=2.35, m5:2*0.195=0.39, m6:4*0.195=0.78. Total mass ~10.7 <30 constraint. So mass acceptable and stress under 20 with these areas.",
    "scratch_pad_final": "Resulting structure is a stable, closed triangular truss with a vertical uplift node to resist load diagonal. Member areas selected to handle forces within stress limits and minimize mass. Node positions respect original inputs, new node added to form triangle. All members connected with no duplicates.",
