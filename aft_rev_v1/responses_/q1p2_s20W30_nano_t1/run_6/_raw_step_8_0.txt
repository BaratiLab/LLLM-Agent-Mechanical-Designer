Aim to reduce max stress magnitude further while respecting constraints.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max tensile stress is 10.58 in member_5 (node_3-node_2), which is close to half allowable limit. Members with larger cross sectional areas (area 4 in member_1 and member_3) carry low stress, suggesting inefficient mass distribution. Members with small area (2 and 3) have moderate stress. Overall, structure is safe but mass is high due to large areas in some members, especially member_1 (area 4) with large mass 10.01.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing max stress sometimes involves relocating internal nodes (node_4 and node_5), shifting load paths to balance forces. Also reassigning member areas can optimize mass-stress tradeoff. We can consider reducing area of member_1 and member_3 and increase area of other members slightly to balance stress. Node_5 can be moved slightly upward/right to reduce stress on member_5 and member_2.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Node_1 and node_2 are supports and node_3 is load point; their positions cannot be changed. Internal nodes node_4 and node_5 can move. Current node_5 at (2.5,2.0) and node_4 at (3.0,1.8). Moving node_5 slightly toward node_4 (higher y, closer to mid-span) can redistribute forces so member_5 (node_3-node_2) stress reduces. Member areas can be adjusted: reduce area 4 in member_1 to area 3 (from 10.01 mass to less), increase area in lower stress members to better carry load, possibly swap some area 3 members to area 4 or area 3. Avoid increasing total mass above 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths calculated from points; adjust node_5 to (2.6, 2.1) and node_4 to (3.0,1.9) to increase triangle robustness. Area changes: member_1 area 3 (3.128 mass per unit), member_3 area 3, member_2 area 4 (keep), member_4 area 3, member_5 area 3, member_6 area 2 - optimized to balance tensile and compressive forces. Expect stress reduction on member_5 due to geometry shift, small mass increment acceptable within 30 limit.",\n\n  "calculation": "Node_5 moved to (2.6, 2.1) and node_4 to (3.0, 1.9). Swap member_1 area from 4 to 3, member_3 area 4 to 3, member_2 and member_4 keep area 3 and 3 respectively for stiffness, member_5 reduced from 2 to 1 to reduce mass but maintain strength. Member_6 area 2 unchanged. Estimated total mass ~26.5 < 30; max stress estimated <10 (below 10.58), balancing compressive and tensile members.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Node moves maintain structural integrity, geometry changes slightly improve load paths.
