  "preamble": "Refining node positions and member areas to further reduce max stress while adhering to constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 17.12 < 20 limit; total mass 17.25 < 30 limit. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Nodes_1 and 2 fixed. Members mostly low stress but member_2 at 17.12 max tension.",
  "analysis": "Max stress occurs at member_2 (node_5 to node_6) with area '2' and stress 17.12 close to limit. Member_1 and member_3 have moderate compressive stress. Member_4 zero stress. Member_8 tension 14.11. Current node_6 location and small cross-sectional area on member_2 cause peak stress. Node_5 and node_6 positions influence geometry and force paths. More balanced geometry may help reduce peak stress. Areas currently vary between 1,2,3 mostly, mass is relatively low. Potential to slightly move node_6 closer to node_5 horizontally and vertically to improve load path. Possibly reduce area of member_2 if stress reduces. Member_7 and member_6 have minor tensile/compressive stress, can be optimized if geometry adjusted. Constraints allow some margin for adjustments.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Shift node_6 slightly closer to node_5 horizontally and upward vertically to balance load. Slightly increase area on member_3 from '2' to '3' to reduce compressive stress. Member_2 area could remain '2' but geometry tweak might reduce stress below 15 allowing mass reduction later. Members_1 and 4 area '3' look acceptable. Keep member_8 area '1' as lower area is preferable if stress allows. Maintain closed truss shape with current members but improve triangle shape formed by nodes 3,5,6.",
  "reasoning": "Moving node_6 from (2.8,1.3) towards (2.7,1.5) will improve load transfer from node_5 to node_3, reducing tension in member_2. Increasing member_3's area to '3' will resist compression better. With better load distribution, max tensile stress in member_2 will decrease below 17. Validating mass: Slight increase in member_3 mass offset by possible reduced stress allowing decrease of member_2 area in next iterations. Keep other members unchanged for stability. No change to load/support nodes. Use precise floats for node positions. No duplicate nodes or members introduced. The closed truss remains intact.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current max_stress=17.12, mass=17.25 < constraints. Target max_stress <15 per rough target margin for safety. Members mass sum recalculated after area changes. Member length approx: member_2 ~ distance(node_5, node_6). Shift node_6 from (2.8,1.3) to (2.7,1.5) distance shorter or slightly different, but better angle reduces force. Member_3 length same approx (node_6 to node_3). Update member areas: member_3 from '2' to '3'. Expect member_3 stress reduced from -9.25 to around -6 to -7. Member_2 hopefully decreases to ~14-15 tensile. Max stress reduced, safer margin.",
  "calculation": "Coordinate changes: node_6 from (2.8,1.3) to (2.7,1.5). New member lengths: member_2 length ~ sqrt((2.6-2.7)^2 + (2.1-1.5)^2)=sqrt(0.01+0.36)=0.608. Slightly shorter than before (~0.92). Member_3 length ~ sqrt((2.7-2)^2+(1.5-0)^2)=sqrt(0.49+2.25)=~1.63. Increase area member_3 from '2'(0.782) to '3'(1.759) approx double, reduces stress by factor ~0.44. Mass impact: member_3 mass doubles approx, increments member mass ~1.19 to ~2.7. Member_2 mass reduces from 0.645 to approx 0.6 due to shorter length and area stay same. Total mass ~17.3-17.5 estimate. Max stress reduces to approx tensile 15 max (on member_2).",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints remain met: max stress < 20, total mass < 30. Geometry modified only node_6 position within allowed bounds. Member areas adjusted only on member_3 increasing cross-section to accommodate compression. Members maintain closed truss integrity. Load and support nodes unchanged. Mass increase minimal. Stress distribution improved, safer limits achieved. Recommend continue optimization to next iterations for potential minor improvements before stopping.",
