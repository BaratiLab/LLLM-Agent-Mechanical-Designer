Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Max stress ±20, mass ≤30. Current max stress 25.4>20, mass 19.57<30. Need to reduce max stress and keep mass acceptable.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has a max stress violation mainly in member_7 (\'node_1\'-\'node_4\') with stress 25.438. Member_7 area=1 is likely undersized. Some members have zero stress and can be downsized or removed. Members carry moderate to low stress. Structural stiffness and load path should be balanced. Node layout mostly fixed except free nodes \'node_4\', \'node_5\', \'node_6\'. Current layout tries to distribute forces. Member areas should be adjusted, higher areas on high stress members, and possibly remove low stress members to reduce weight. Max mass is well below 30, headroom for increasing area if needed.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on increasing area on member_7 to reduce stress below 20, possibly area_id from 1 to 2 or 3. Check force path: Load at node_3 must be transferred through node_4 & 6 to supports. Consider removing member_3 (\'node_4\'-\'node_5\'), zero stress. Reduce mass increase by trimming area where stress is low. Possibly decrease area on member_1 to 2 to reduce mass since stress there is 0. Recheck max stress after area mods.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep current nodes. Adjust member areas: raise area of \'member_7\' to 3 (area=1.759), \'member_1\' reduce to 2 (area=0.782). Remove member_3 (\'node_4\'-\'node_5\') which carries zero stress to reduce complexity and mass. Slightly reduce area of \'member_5\' and \'member_6\' to 1 to reduce mass as their stresses are low. Keep remaining member areas same.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing cross-sectional area reduces stress inversely. Member_7 exceeds allowable stress, so its area must increase. Member_3 has zero stress, removing it reduces mass without compromising strength. Reducing area in low stress members reduces mass. Areas chosen from discrete set.
