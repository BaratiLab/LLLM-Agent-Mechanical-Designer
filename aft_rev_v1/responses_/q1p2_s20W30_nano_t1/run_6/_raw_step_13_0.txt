Supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller). Current design high stress in member_3 (-110.7 > -20). Total mass 11.886 < 30. Goal: redistribute forces to reduce max stress, adjust cross-sectional areas and geometry.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has a small top node cluster (node_4, node_5) close together at around x=3, y~2. Members with large stress: member_3 (node_5-node_4) compressive -110; member_5 (node_3-node_2) tensile 42; member_6 (node_1-node_4) tensile 54. Likely load path is inefficient causing stress concentration. Areas used are low at member_3 (area \'1\'=0.195). Mass distribution is skewed with member_1 heavy. The structure lacks direct load path from load node_3 to supports, leading to high stress in diagonal members. Node_5 close to node_4 with small connecting member_3 may cause force amplification.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider removing node_5 or moving it to create a stronger triangular support with adequate spacing. Increase areas in high stress members, shorten longest members to reduce bending. Introduce a node above node_3 to create a stiffer upper chord connecting supports and load node. Maintain existing support and load nodes fixed. Use areas no greater than necessary to reduce mass but respect stress limits.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_5 to reduce complexity and relocate a new node above node_3 at (2.0, 2.5) named node_6. Connect nodes for a truss: node_1-node_6, node_6-node_2, node_6-node_3, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_4-node_6. Also place node_4 at (3.0, 1.5) to form a stable triangular configuration with node_1 and node_2. Assign areas to reduce stress: use area \'3\' (1.759) for key tension/compression diagonals; area \'2\' (0.782) for horizontal members; smaller area \'1\' (0.195) for shorter braces. This layout will more evenly distribute forces and lower max stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "A simple triangular truss with well-placed nodes near midpoint height distributes load efficiently. Node_6 at (2.0,2.5) near vertical above load node connects directly to supports, reducing bending and stress. Node_4 at (3.0,1.5) stabilizes middle span. Larger areas on main diagonals reduce stress below 20. Shortening some members reduces forces. Removing the close-by node_5 avoids stress in short members. Load and support nodes unchanged per instructions. The mass is controlled by limiting large cross-sections to main members only.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_1(0,0)-node_6(2,2.5)=~3.2016; node_6(2,2.5)-node_2(6,0)=~4.7169; node_6-node_3=2.5; node_1-node_3=2.0; node_3-node_2=4.0; node_1-node_4=~3.3541; node_4-node_2=~3.3541; node_4-node_6=~1.8028. Assign areas: nodes 1-6, 6-2, 6-3 area 3 (1.759), nodes 1-4, 4-2 area 2 (0.782), others area 1 (0.195). Estimate mass: sum(length*area) ≈ below 30. Stress in main members should stay below limit given larger areas and better geometry.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths and areas -> mass approx: (3.2016*1.759)+(4.7169*1.759)+(2.5*1.759)+(3.3541*0.782)*2+(1.8028*0.195)+(2.0*0.195)+(4.0*0.195).

Total=5.63+8.29+4.4+5.25+0.35+0.39+0.78=approx 25.1 <30. Stress expected reduced with larger areas and improved layout.
