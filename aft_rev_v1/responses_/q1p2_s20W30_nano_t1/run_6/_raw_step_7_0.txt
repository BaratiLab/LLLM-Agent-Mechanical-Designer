Load at node_3 (-10N, -45°). Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Current design\'s max stress = 76.5 > 20 violates stress constraint. Mass = 24.7 < 30 allowed. Need to reduce peak stress by redistributing load and stiffening critical members with optimal cross-sections and geometry. Node_4 moved earlier; consider adding nodes for better triangulation and improved load path.",\n\n  "analysis": "High stress in member_1 (node_1-node_3) indicates insufficient load path near load application point. Member_3 (node_4-node_2) carries low stress, suggesting possible reallocation. Using a taller truss with an intermediate node above node_3 can reduce axial load in node_1-node_3 member. Area sizes should increase on high-stress members and reduce where low stress. Introduce node_5 above node_3 around (2.5, 2.0) for load redistribution. Use stiffer members on compression members under load. Avoid overly large areas on all members to keep mass ≤ 30.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Plan: Keep support and load nodes fixed. Add node_5 at (2.5, 2.0). Connect node_1-node_5, node_5-node_3, node_5-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_2. Remove direct node_1-node_3 member to reduce direct load. Assign areas: larger for compression-tension critical diagonals (area_id 4 or 5), smaller for others (area_id 2 or 3). Calculate member lengths, estimate stresses by structural logic and select areas to satisfy constraints. Aim total mass ≤ 30.",\n\n  "proposal": "Redefine nodes as: node_1 (0.0, 0.0), node_2 (6.0, 0.0), node_3 (2.0, 0.0), node_4 (3.0, 1.8), node_5 (2.5, 2.0).

Using larger cross-section area in diagonal members carrying high compression or tension reduces stress magnitude. Smaller cross-section in members with less stress keeps mass down. Removed direct node_1-node_3 member to force load redistribution around node_5. Support boundary nodes remain fixed for proper support reaction.
