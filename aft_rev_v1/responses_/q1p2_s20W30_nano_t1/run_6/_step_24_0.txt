  "preamble": "Optimize truss under asymmetric load, keep stresses <= 20, total mass <= 30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 (-10kN at -45deg). Supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller. Existing mid nodes and members lead to high stress at member_8 (-68). Mass acceptable (11.3 < 30). Need to reduce peak stress by enhancing load path and stiffness, possibly redistribute members and area sizes.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress of 68 on member_8 greatly exceeds ±20 constraint, mass is good at 11.3. Stress distribution uneven, some members zero stress, likely underused. Current triangular shape with redundant internal members may be inefficient. Load at node_3 downward-left applies tension/compression along members connected. Member_8 (node_1 to node_3) under high tension. Member_7 (node_4 to node_2) high compression (25.3). Areas mostly '2' (0.782) for main diagonals, '1' (0.195) for bottom chords. Better area assignment may reduce max stress.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding node near load to distribute load. Adjust member connections to form more triangular, braced pattern to reduce bending. Increase areas in overstressed members and decrease in underutilized members for mass efficiency. Avoid big tension in bottom chord member_8 by splitting load with intermediate node or adding a diagonal member from node_1 to node_8 or node_5. Keep support and load nodes fixed. Check member length and area for mass estimate.",
  
  "proposal": "Add intermediate node near node_3 slightly to left and up (e.g., node_9 at (1.6, 0.8)) to redistribute load. Connect node_9 to node_1, node_3, node_4 and node_8. Remove direct member node_1 to node_3 or reduce its area. Increase area of key load-carrying members (node_4 to node_2, node_4 to node_5) to '3' or '4'. Adjust bottom chord members to '1' or '2' to save mass. Remove redundant members if any. Final aim: no member stress > ±20, total mass < 30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Adding node closer to load spreads force. New diagonals to load node increase truss stability, reduce peak stresses. Increasing area of critical members reduces stress. Removing bottom chord member_8 with high tension force and splitting with nodes reduces stress concentration. This layout optimizes load paths, prevents excessive bending, and satisfies mass limit with judicious area assigning.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "- Proposed node_9 (1.6, 0.8) near node_3 (2,0) and under existing node_8 (3.5,1.2).\n- Members:\n  * node_1-node_9 (area 2)\n  * node_9-node_3 (area 2)\n  * node_9-node_4 (area 3)\n  * node_9-node_8 (area 2)\n- Modify member_8 to lower area or remove.\n- Existing members like node_4-node_2 and node_4-node_5 keep or increase area to 3 or 4.\n- Keep areas for less stressed members low to reduce mass.\n- Calculate mass: use lengths × area weight factors, sum ≤30.\n- Check stress roughly assuming force redistribution through new members reduces maximum from 68 to <20.\n- Allow slight vertical shift for load node neighbour to provide vertical stiffness.",
