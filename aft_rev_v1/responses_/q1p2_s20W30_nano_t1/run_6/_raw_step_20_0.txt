Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Current max stress 68.3 > 20. Mass 22.63 < 30. Need to reduce max stress by better force distribution and member sizing.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current heavy stress on member_2 (node_6-node_4, +64.68) and member_8 (node_1-node_4, -68.3) exceeds limits. Members connecting load node_3 and upper nodes have high tensile/compressive force imbalance. Also, member areas are moderate, some members have large length and small area creating stress concentration. Structure topology uses 6 nodes, with internal node_6 poorly positioned causing large forces/stresses on few members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Improving force paths by repositioning internal node_6 slightly higher and shifted closer toward load node_3 captures load better. Adding member from load node to node_4 to form stable triangular substructure reduces bending effects. Using smaller area sizes on low force members, and appropriate sizing on critical members to cap stress at ±20. Avoid heavy reliance on single members, redistribute forces.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Maintain load/support nodes fixed. Move node_6 to (1.5, 1.7) to improve geometry. Add a new diagonal member from node_3 to node_4 to directly carry load. Trim or remove redundant or highly stressed members. Adjust area assignments: use area 4 (3.128) or area 3 (1.759) for critical members; use smaller areas (1 or 2) for low force members. New topology: members connect node_1-node_6, node_6-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_5-node_2 (node_5 fixed at 4.0,1.5), node_4-node_5 and node_3-node_5, plus node_1-node_4 for stability. No duplicate members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Moving node_6 upward and slightly to the right reduces moment arm for loaded node_3 forces and strengthens force path through node_6 and node_4. Adding direct link node_3-node_4 reduces load on node_6 node_4 member. Choosing area sizes based on expected force magnitudes keeps stresses within limits and reduces overall mass. The previous structure’s max stress is too high on members spanning node_6-node_4 and node_1-node_4, changing geometry and adding members resolves this. Member areas around 1.759 or 3.128 balance weight and strength well.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: \\n- node_1(0,0) to node_6(1.5,1.7) length ≈ √(1.5²+1.7²)=2.28\\n- node_6 to node_4(2,2) length ≈ √(0.5² +0.3²)=0.58\\n- node_4 to node_3(2,0) length=2.0\\n- node_3 to node_2(6,0) length=4.0\\n- node_5(4,1.5) to node_2 length ≈ 1.8\\n- node_4 to node_5 length ≈ √(2.0² +0.5²)=2.06\\n- node_3 to node_5 length ≈ √(2.0² +1.5²)=2.5\\n- node_1 to node_4 length ≈ √(2.0² +2.0²)=2.828\\nEstimate mass = sum(length * area).
