Current max stress ~71.8>20, mass ~14.5<30, so stress is limiting. Existing design has long horizontal member_6 (node_1-node_3) overstressed. Must reduce member stresses by reconfiguring nodes and members, better load path, avoid direct large single members between supports and load nodes. Areas selected from given list.",\n  "analysis": "High tensile stress on member_6 (node_1-node_3) indicates direct long span in tension causing overload. Members near load node_3 are under less stress or compressive, suggests load path needs better triangulation to transfer load with shorter members and balanced areas. Current areas show small to medium sizes; increasing some member areas near load node_3 to better distribute load may help but must avoid significant mass increase. Node_4 and node_5 placed somewhat arbitrarily; repositioning them vertically and horizontally to form stronger triangles is key.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Plan to add intermediate node between node_3 and node_2 closer to node_3 horizontally and slightly upwards for triangulation; reposition node_4 upward slightly; reorganize members to create two main triangle load paths to limits supports from node_3; reduce long horizontal members in tension; use area sizing assignation to control max stress within ±20.",\n  "proposal": "Keep nodes_1,2,3 fixed; Add node_8 at (3.5,1.2) between node_3 and node_2; move node_4 slightly upward to (2.5,1.9); Keep node_5 at (4.0,1.5) for triangulation.

Node_4 raised slightly improves triangle stability. Member areas chosen with 1–3 range to limit mass but provide strength to reduce overstress.
