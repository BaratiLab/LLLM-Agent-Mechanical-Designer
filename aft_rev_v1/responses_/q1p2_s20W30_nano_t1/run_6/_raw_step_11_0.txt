Current max stress 63.1 >20, mass 18.8 <30.",\n  "analysis": "High stress on member_4 and member_2 in current design indicates poor force distribution. Member_4 has stress 63.1 (tension), member_2 -46.4 (compression). Mass is low enough to allow increased section areas or additional members to redistribute stresses.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Nodes for load/support kept fixed. Node_6 placement and members involving it caused stress spikes. Prior attempts with node_5 near (2.6,2.1) and node_4 near (3,1.9) show improved but still overstressed members. Need simpler triangulated network ensuring load path from node_3 up to node_4 and nodes_1/2 supports.",\n  "proposal": "Remove node_6; keep node_5 and node_4 with minor repositioning to improve geometry for force transfer. Connect \'node_3-node_5\', \'node_4-node_5\', \'node_1-node_5\', \'node_1-node_4\', \'node_4-node_2\', \'node_3-node_2\' plus bottom chord \'node_1-node_3\', \'node_3-node_2\' to form stable truss with triangular substructures. Assign areas mostly \'3\' or \'4\' to members transferring higher forces to keep stress under 20. Use larger areas (4) for longest/high load members, smaller (2-3) elsewhere to balance mass/stress. Total mass estimated under 30.",\n  "reasoning": "Triangulated truss with nodes well positioned near load and supports will reduce bending moments, concentrate axial forces, lowering max stress. Enlarging member areas selectively reduces stress. Without node_6, simplify load path to avoid peak stresses seen previously.
