Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current max stress 60.4 > 20 limit; mass 10.4 < 30 max. Need to reduce stress, maintain or reduce mass.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure combing horizontal base (node_1 to node_2) with vertical and diagonal members around node_3 and node_4. Max compressive stress on member_1 (-60.4) suggests member_1 is overstressed. Areas used: 1 to 3. Adjust members to redistribute load and reduce stress.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 overstressed, so increase area or add another load path. Adding node between node_3 and node_4 to split load or add truss branching node above node_3 could help. Keep load/support nodes fixed, can only add/move internal nodes.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add one node (node_5) above node_3 at (2.0,1.5) to form a triangular truss with members from node_3 to node_5, node_5 to node_4, node_5 to node_1, and node_5 to node_2. Reallocate areas with larger sections for highly stressed members and smaller for others.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular truss is efficient for load transfer. Adding node_5 enables triangulation reducing bending and stress in members. By increasing area_id on critical members and sharing load paths, max stress can be reduced under Â±20. Area selection based on stress and length to keep mass under 30.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Approximate lengths: node_1-node_3: 2m; node_3-node_5:1.5m; node_5-node_4~1.12m; node_5-node_1~1.8m; node_5-node_2~4.12m; node_3-node_2:4m; node_4-node_2:4m. Area ids: critical members use 3 (1.759), others 1 (0.195) or 2(0.782). Stress assumed proportional to load/area.
