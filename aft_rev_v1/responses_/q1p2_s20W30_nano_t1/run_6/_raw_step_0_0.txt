To form closed truss, add a node above the line to form triangle. Triangle shape is stable and minimal for three supports and load. Place new node (node_4) vertically above node_3 to resist load. Members will connect all nodes forming closed loop with diagonals to optimize force paths. Areas will be assigned to keep max stress within ±20 and mass ≤30 constraint.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2.0, h) where h chosen ~3.0 to create height. Members: node_1-node_2 (base), node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2 maybe. Simplify to closed polygon with redundant members limited. Choose areas from smallest needed to balance forces and minimize mass.",\n    "reasoning": "Assumptions: Linear static analysis. Axial force only in members. Load of 10N at node_3 at 45° down-left implies compression in members connected to node_4. Tension/compression limited to 20 units. Use length for mass: length × area. Area selection guided by approximate force in members. Node_3 is loaded; triangulation stabilizes loads. Minimum members: base edge (node_1-node_2), two sides connecting to node_4, and node_3 connected to node_4 and base nodes for stability. Node_4 height chosen to optimize cross-sectional area vs force. Approximate force distribution using static equilibrium equations.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths of members: base 6m, vertical legs from node_4 to base nodes ~3.605m (sqrt((2-0)^2 + 3^2)), node_3 connections vary. Assume tension in vertical legs, compression in base. Areas selected progressively. Max stress ≤20 used to determine required area given force = stress × area. Mass sum verified by sum(length × area) ≤30.",\n    "calculation": "Node locations: node_1(0.0,0.0), node_2(6.0,0.0), node_3(2.0,0.0), node_4(2.0,3.0).

Assume force in members roughly proportional to member orientation resisting load. Max expected force ~10N, max stress 20 → min area= force/stress=10/20=0.5. Use area=0.782 (area_id \'2\') for critical members, area=0.195 (area_id \'1\') for base small tension members to save mass. Mass sum approximately: m1: 6*0.195=1.17, m2:3.605*0.782=2.82, m3:4.123*0.782=3.22, m4:3*0.782=2.35, m5:2*0.195=0.39, m6:4*0.195=0.78. Total mass ~10.7 <30 constraint.
