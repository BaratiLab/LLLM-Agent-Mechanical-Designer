Supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller) fix structure horizontally. Current max stress exceeds limits mainly in member_4 (node_1-node_3). Mass under limit. Objective: reduce stress peaks, keep mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has nodes mostly aligned with members of area ids 3,2,1 mainly. Max compressive stress at member_4 is -54, beyond allowable ±20. The member_4 is short horizontal between node_1(0,0) and node_3(2,0). High stress due to direct load transmission. The triangular top with node_6 at (2,2.5) connected to nodes 1,3,2,4 is plausible but member_8 (node_4-node_6) stressed. Current design uses many small members with varying area sizes. The load path is direct from node_3 but member_4 overstressed. Key is to relieve horizontal member compressive stress by adding upper chord or rearranging node positions without altering supports/loads. Total mass is 25, room for some increase but minimal.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_4 up and to the left to increase vertical triangulation. Possibly increase cross-sectional area on critical compressive members. Simplify structure to fewer members with optimized areas. Possibly remove low stressed members and reinforce critical members with larger areas. Add node near midpoint between node_1 and node_3 elevated to form stable triangle. Avoid adding members with high stiffness to unload member_4.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node (node_5) near midpoint between node_1 and node_3 at (1.0, 1.5). Connect node_1-node_5, node_5-node_3, node_5-node_6 (2.0, 2.5). Adjust member areas: use area id \'4\' (3.128) for new chords to carry compressive load, use smaller areas for less stressed members. Remove member_4 (node_1-node_3) to avoid direct overload. Keep top triangle node_6 connecting node_1, node_2, node_3 via node_5 to distribute load better. This triggers a truss with multiple load paths, reduces stress concentration on single member. ",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing the overstressed horizontal member_4 (node_1-node_3) removes direct compressive overload. Inserting node_5 midway elevated forms vertical triangulation reducing bending stresses on node_3. Using larger cross sections on members carrying compression reduces stress, while smaller areas for tension saves mass. Distributing load among triangular paths stabilizes structure better. This configuration complies with constraints. Mass expected to slightly increase but stay below 30. High stress members replaced by lower stressed ones. Supports respected. Load at node_3 is better compensated by indirect load paths.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_1-node_5 = sqrt((1-0)^2 + (1.5-0)^2)=1.802, node_5-node_3 = sqrt((2-1)^2 + (0-1.5)^2)=1.802, node_5-node_6= sqrt((2-1)^2 + (2.5-1.5)^2)=1.414. Use area 4 (3.128) for these members for compressive loads, expected stress reduction by cross-sectional area increase. Existing members node_1-node_6, node_6-node_2, node_6-node_3 with area 3 (1.759) remain. Member node_3-node_2 with area 1 (0.195) for tension. Remove member_4 (node_1-node_3).
