    "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under load at node_3 with given supports and mass/stress constraints.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 (-10 N at -45deg); supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Max stress ±20, max total mass 30. Current max stress 63 > 20, total mass ~29.3 close to limit.",
    
    "analysis": "Current max stress on member_7 (-63.08) and member_6 (-17.98) exceed tensile/compressive limits. Mass near limit but can be reduced slightly. Members with area 4 and 1 contribute heavily to mass and stress imbalance. Member_7 (node_1-node_3) with area 1 is overstressed. Presence of direct member_1-3 may cause large stress concentration. Current node layout places nodes 4 and 5 close near mid-span, but large area members add mass, especially member_1 & member_4 (area 4).",
    "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce area of high stress members and redistribute force path by re-arranging diagonal members to better share load. Consider removing member_7 direct link (node_1-node_3) or increasing its effective area and modifying topology for triangular bracing to reduce stress. Slightly reposition nodes 4 and 5 to improve geometry and load paths. Replace member connections to ensure statically determinate structure with balanced force distribution.",

    "proposal": "Remove member_7 (node_1-node_3, area 1) to reduce high stress and mass. Increase diagonal bracing area with members node_1-node_5, node_5-node_3, and node_5-node_4 to moderate areas. Move node_4 to (3.05, 2.0) and node_5 to (2.55, 2.1) for better load distribution. Add a new member: node_5 to node_2 with area 3 for additional load path. Keep all existing supports and loads fixed.",
    
    "reasoning": "By eliminating direct node_1-node_3 member, stress concentration decreased. The triangle formed by nodes 1-5-3 and 5-4-2 redistributes forces, reducing maximum stress. Increasing areas on main diagonals ensures strength without excessive weight. Slight node repositioning improves geometry and reduces member length, lowering mass. Adding member from node_5 to node_2 shares load from node_3-2 member. Area selection based on minimizing mass while respecting max stress constraint.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths, approximate mass = sum(length × area). Expect area in {1,3,4}. New total mass should be below 30. Estimate stress reductions based on triangulation and load path.",
