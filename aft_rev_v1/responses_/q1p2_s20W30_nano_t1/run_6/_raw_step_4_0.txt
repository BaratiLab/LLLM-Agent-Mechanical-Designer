Need to reduce stress from >1700 to ≤20 and keep mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current max stress (member_1) is 1734, exceeding limit by factor >80. Mass under limit but stress unacceptable. Current layout overly stressed at member_1 (node_1-node_6). Previous simpler models had lower stress but less triangulation. Need more balanced load paths with careful geometry and proper cross-sectional areas to reduce peak stresses.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Large stress on member_1 suggests load path from node_3 to node_1 is weak. Consider adding vertical node above node_3 to form a stable truss triangle, reduce long members, and use smaller areas on compression members and larger on tension paths to efficiently reduce stress.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add one node above node_3 (new node_4 at (2.0, 2.0)) to create a triangular truss with members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3. Use areas to keep stress below 20 and total mass <30. This geometry improves load transfer and reduces member lengths under tension/compression.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular bracing at node_4 lets axial forces distribute evenly, minimizing member stress. Keep member_1 (node_1-node_3) with small area (0.195) to reduce mass. Use moderate areas on vertical and diagonal members to handle load. The vertical node at (2.0,2.0) neatly supports load flow from node_3 to supports. Avoid redundant members to reduce mass and complexity.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Nodes: 1(0,0), 2(6,0), 3(2,0), 4(2,2).
