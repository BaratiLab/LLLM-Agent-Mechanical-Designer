Need to reduce stress, likely in member_5.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has excessive compressive stress (-38.3) in member_5 (node_1 to node_3). Members connected to node_3 carry high load. Member_5 is short with area=0.195, resulting in high stress. Strategy: redistribute forces by adding triangulation with an additional node and reduce load on member_5. Maintain support and load nodes fixed. Increase cross-sectional areas on highly stressed members within mass budget.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Plan to add a new node above node_3 to form efficient triangles. Connect node_3 to new node and connect new node to node_1 and node_2. Possibly reduce area of member_5 and use larger areas on longer members to reduce stress. Recalculate member lengths and set areas prioritizing stress limits.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (3.0, 2.5) to relieve stress at node_3 and create triangulations.

Assign areas based on stress demand within limits.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Placing node_5 at (3.0, 2.5) forms stable triangular substructures distributing load path away from overloaded member_5. Member lengths optimized for stress and mass. Use area 2 (0.782) for high-stress members and area 1 (0.195) for low-stress. Member_5 area decreased to reduce its stress.
