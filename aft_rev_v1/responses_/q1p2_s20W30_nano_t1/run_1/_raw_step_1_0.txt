Node_3 is not fixed, optimization can move it along x to reduce stress if allowed but instruction forbids moving loaded nodes. The highest stress is member_3 at -11.3, compressive but well below limit. Mass is reasonable at 17.1, leaving room to adjust areas if needed.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Option is to reposition node_4 to reduce bending or improve force paths. Current node_4 y=3.5 may be too low causing high compressive stress on member_3. Increase y for node_4 to stiffen the upper triangle. However, shifting node_4 upwards may increase mass and cause stress redistribution.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Given constraints and instructions, moving node_4 vertically slightly upwards to better align load paths is optimal. Member sections appear adequate with moderate areas (mostly \'2\'). Reducing areas on lightly stressed members could be possible but minimal gain given mass is already low. Further geometry improvements limited due to fixed load/support nodes and closed truss requirement.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member_3 compressive stress close to member_6 compressive stress -9.4; balancing these could minimize peak stress; node_4 move optimizes triangle geometry; area IDs kept same as mostly balanced; member_2 with low stress area 1 is efficient; mass constraint not limiting.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Slightly increased node_4 y from 3.5 to 3.8 to reduce compressive stress on member_3 by lengthening member_4 and member_5; node_3, node_1 and node_2 fixed; members maintained; areas kept to avoid over mass; estimated new stress values reduced below 11 with minor gains.
