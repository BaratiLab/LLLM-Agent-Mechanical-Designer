    "preamble": "Optimize closed 2D truss with 3 fixed nodes under load with stress and mass constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "The problem: 3 nodes with fixed positions and supports; one node loaded. Objective: minimize stress within ±20 and total member length×area ≤ 30. Truss must be closed (all nodes connected). Areas from predefined set. Only node_3 loaded at -10N at -45°. Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2.",
    
    "analysis": "Triangle with nodes (0,0), (6,0), and (2,0) is colinear, so structure not stable. Need one more node out of line to create a closed stable triangle for load transfer. To keep constraints, add one node above the line between node_1 and node_2. This will close truss with 4 nodes, making a stable triangle with 3 members on bottom and at least 3 members total. Load on node_3 to be supported by tension and compression in members. Select minimal but sufficient areas to keep stress ≤20 and mass ≤30.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 above line between node_1(0,0) and node_2(6,0), say (3.0, 3.5) to form triangle nodes 1-2-4 and also connect node_3 to node_4 for stability and load path. Members: 1-2, 2-3, 3-1 form base, add members 1-4, 2-4, 3-4 to close truss.",
    
    "reasoning": "1. Add node_4 at (3.0, 3.5) above line 1-2 for stability. \n2. Members: (1-2), (2-3), (3-1), (1-4), (2-4), (3-4).\n3. Calculate member lengths.\n4. Approximate forces from static equilibrium in 2D.\n5. Select areas to satisfy stress ≤20 and minimize mass.\n\nAssumptions:\n- Linear static analysis\n- Load -10 N at 45° down-left at node_3\n- Vertical pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2\n- Stress is force/(area*unit length)\n- Use unit thickness and unit Young's modulus scaled out\n- Areas from given table\n- Mass proportional to length*area\n- Closed truss means all nodes connected in at least one cycle",
