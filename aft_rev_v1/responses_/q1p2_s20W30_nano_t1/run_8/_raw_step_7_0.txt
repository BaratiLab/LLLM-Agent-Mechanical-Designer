Max stress ±20, max mass 30. Node_1, _2, _3 fixed positions. History shows stress marginally above limit (-22.14) on member_1 and near limit (-20.27) on member_7. Mass 24.44 under 30 limit but stress exceeds.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has member_1 overstressed in compression (-22.14 > -20) and member_7 near max tension (-20.27 close to tensile limit). Member_1 connects node_1 to node_5 and is critical; node_5 positioned to left/up to node_3. Using area 3 (1.759) might be insufficient or geometry induces high stress. Member_7 (node_5 to node_4) area 2 (0.782) barely supports tension. Current node_5 and node_6 placement creates elongated members with high axial forces.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce stress on member_1 by repositioning node_5 closer to node_1 and node_3 to shorten and align forces better. Increase member areas strategically or reroute forces by adding node to break long members. Keep node_5 left but lower, node_6 closer to line node_3-node_2 to shorten and reduce stress. Possibly add a new node between node_5 and node_4 to improve load distribution.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_7 between node_5 and node_4 at (2.3, 1.75). Move node_5 slightly left/down to (1.5, 1.7) to reduce length and compressive stress on member_1. Move node_6 to (3.2, 1.5). Redefine members: node_1-node_5, node_5-node_7, node_7-node_4, node_3-node_5, node_3-node_6, node_6-node_2, node_7-node_6, node_3-node_4 (optional, small area). Use larger areas on critical compression members (member_1 area 4 = 3.128) and tension members (like member_7 area 3=1.759). Keep total mass under 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_7 and breaking member_7 into two shorter members reduces stress on the critical tension member. Moving node_5 closer to node_1 reduces length and compression force. Adjusting node_6 reduces member length and bending moments. Increasing member areas where stress is near limit reduces stress by increasing capacity. Preserving load/support nodes fixed as required. Node addition keeps statical determinacy and better force paths.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_1-node_5 ~ sqrt((1.5)^2 + (1.7)^2)=2.28, area=3.128; node_5-node_7 ~ (2.3-1.5, 1.75-1.7) ~0.8, area 1.759; node_7-node_4 ~ (3.0-2.3, 2.4-1.75)=0.93, area 1.759; node_3-node_5 ~ (2.0-1.5, 0.0-1.7)=1.77, area=1.759; node_3-node_6 ~ (3.2-2,1.5-0)=2.5, area=0.782; node_6-node_2 ~ (6-3.2,0-1.5)=3.54, area=0.782; node_7-node_6 ~ (3.2-2.3,1.5-1.75)=0.95, area=1.759; node_3-node_4 ~ (3-2,2.4-0)=2.49, area=0.195 (small to reduce mass).
