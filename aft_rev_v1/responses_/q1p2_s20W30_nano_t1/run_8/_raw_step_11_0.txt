Current design stress and mass borderline. Load at node_3 (-10N, -45°), supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Nodes fixed at supports and load. Moderate height for effective load transfer is needed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current iteration mass is 30.11 (slightly above 30 if approximated). Max stress 10.89 well below limit. Slight mass reduction possible by area sizing. Stress margins ample, so we can reduce section areas where stress is low. Members like member_6 with large area (4) may be optimized smaller. Node_7 is unused here, no need to add more nodes as structure is stable. Adding diagonal members near load and between supports can spread stresses better.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on downsizing large areas while keeping stress in ±20. Simplify members near top chord, lower top chord elevation slightly for better force flow. Maintain triangular bracing between supports and load.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep node layout similar, modify node_4 y from 2.0 to 1.8 to reduce member lengths and mass slightly. Use node_7 at (2.0,1.2) to add a diagonal member from node_7 to node_6, replacing some larger members with smaller ones to reduce mass. Reduce some areas from 4 or 3 to 2 or 1 to decrease mass but still support stresses <= 20. Add member from node_7 to node_6 with area 2. Keep all supports and load nodes fixed as required.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Reducing height slightly reduces member lengths and thus mass. Adding node_7 as intermediate allows load redistribution. Downsizing areas on members with low stress reduces mass without violating constraints. Triangular bracing reduces deflections and peak stresses. Maintaining connectivity ensures stability.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calc, mass = sum(length * area factor). Max area factor 3 or 4 reduced to 2 or 1 where stress low (~|stress|<10). New member added for improved force distribution. Keep member counts minimal to keep mass low.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Lengths approx: member_1 (node_1-node_5): ~1.8, member_2 (node_5-node_3): ~1.2, member_3 (node_3-node_7): ~0.3, member_4 (node_7-node_4): ~0.6, member_5 (node_4-node_6): ~1.2, member_6 (node_6-node_2): ~1.8, member_7 (node_3-node_6): ~2.3, member_8 (node_1-node_3): ~2.0, member_9 (node_3-node_2): ~4.0, member_10 (node_7-node_6): ~1.1. Areas assigned mostly 1 or 2 to keep mass below 30 while stress ≤ 20.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Mass sum under 30, max stress well under ±20 according to trends.
