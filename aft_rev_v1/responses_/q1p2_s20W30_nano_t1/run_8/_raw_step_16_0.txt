Node_4 and node_7 positions can be adjusted to better distribute load and reduce these stresses. Also member_5 (node_4-node_7) has moderate compression -6.89. Slightly lowering node_4â€™s vertical coordinate and shifting nodes 7 and 8 to improve geometry can reduce stress concentrations. Areas are mostly mid-range (2-3). Total mass is comfortable below limit, so we can maintain similar cross-section sizes or reduce slightly on lower stress members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing tension/compression imbalance on nodes 4 and 7 by slight geometric adjustments: decrease node_4 y from 1.65 to ~1.5; node_7 y from 1.1 to ~1.0; node_8 x from 2.5 to 2.6, y from 1.8 to 1.7 to improve triangular stability and load paths.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Lowering node_4 reduces bending lever arm and may reduce stress in member_3 and member_5. Slightly lowering node_7 reduces tension in member_6 (node_7-node_2). Adjusting node_8 position ensures no member degeneration and maintains closed truss shape and stable geometry. All load and supports fixed as required. Area selections remain consistent for efficiency. Members with low stress (member_9, member_10) retain small cross sections (area 2 or 1).",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check that no member length drastically changes to keep mass stable.
