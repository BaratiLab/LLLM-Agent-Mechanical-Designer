Load at node_3 (-10 N at -45 deg), supports at node_1(pinned), node_2(roller). Current mass=34.3 (>30), max_stress=15 (<20) at member_10. All nodes fixed except intermediate nodes for repositioning/removal/addition.\\n",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has 8 nodes with some mid-height diagonals and a rectangular upper web. Mass exceeded mainly due to large areas (area_id=4) on long members and complex webbing adding mass. Max stress is acceptable but mass exceeds constraint. Members: some with large cross-sections and redundant members add weight. Load at node_3 suggests truss should efficiently route force from node_3 towards supports at nodes 1 and 2.\\n",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce heavy members by lowering area_ids; simplify web to reduce mass. Possibly remove node_8 and nodes with low participation. Reposition nodes for better force distribution. Preserve supports and load nodes unchanged. Introduce triangular bracing for stability and efficient load path. Target mass <30, max stress <20.\\n",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_8, reposition nodes 4 and 7 for optimal triangulation. Use simplified web with fewer members but sufficient triangulation. Use area_ids mainly 3 and below with larger areas only where high stress is expected. Members directly connected to load node_3 and supports get moderate areas, others smaller. Member layout: \\n - Bottom chord: node_1-node_3-node_2\\n - Upper chord with nodes 4 and 7 forming triangles with node_3 and supports\\n - Diagonal braces from node_3 to node_4 and node_7 to node_2\\n - Remove redundant members to reduce mass.\\n",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular truss shape efficiently carries loads with minimal members. Avoid large areas on long members. Moving node_4 to about (3.2,1.8), node_7 to (2.4,1.3) keeps structure stable and reduces lengths. Using smaller areas where stresses are small saves mass. Load at node_3 can be handled by direct bracing to supports via these triangles. This reduces complexity and mass.\\n",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths for new geometry. Use area_id=3 (1.759) for critical members, 2(0.782) or 1(0.195) for less stressed. Estimate member stresses roughly proportional to force paths. Mass = sum(length*area weight). Target total mass <30 by adjusting member areas judiciously.\\n",\n  \n  "calculation": "Nodes:\\n node_1:(0.0,0.0), node_2:(6.0,0.0), node_3:(2.0,0.0), node_4:(3.2,1.8), node_7:(2.4,1.3)\\nMembers:\\n bottom chord: node_1-node_3 = 2.0 length; area_id=3 => mass~2.0*1.759=3.518\\n node_3-node_2=4.0 length; area_id=3 => 7.036\\n node_1-node_4 length~3.43; area_id=2 => 3.43*0.782=2.68\\n node_3-node_4 length~1.81; area_id=3 => 3.18\\n node_4-node_7 length~0.64; area_id=1 => 0.12\\n node_7-node_2 length ~2.06; area_id=2 => 1.61\\n node_3-node_7 length ~1.48; area_id=2 => 1.16\\n total mass estimate ~19.26 << 30, good margin.\\nMax stress estimated well below 20 with moderate areas and short members.\\n",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_final": "Final node placement reduces redundant nodes and members, lowers areas, simplifies geometry.
