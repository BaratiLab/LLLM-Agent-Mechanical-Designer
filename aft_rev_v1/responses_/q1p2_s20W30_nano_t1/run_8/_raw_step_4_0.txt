Load concentrated at node_3; supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Node_3 on baseline; other nodes elevated for triangulation.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current design at iteration 3 has max stress 10.34 < 20, so stress is okay but total mass 35.12 > 30, violating mass constraint. Members near load node_3 have large cross-sectional areas (4 and 3), increasing mass. The structure uses 7 members and 5 nodes. Current node_5 placed at (3.0, 1.8) adds mass due to longer members with large areas. Member_6 has zero stress, indicating possible redundancy or inefficient load path.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Strategy: reduce member areas especially those with low stresses and optimize node placement to maintain load transfer while reducing mass. Possibly remove or reposition node_5 to prevent heavy members. Keep load and support nodes fixed. Use smaller area segments for tension members and larger area only where needed. Maintain triangulation for stability.",\n\n  "proposal": "Remove node_5 to eliminate heavy members 3 and 4 responsible for excessive mass. Connect node_1 and node_2 directly to node_4 (located between node_1 and node_2 at higher elevation), and node_3 connected to node_4. Add an extra intermediate node_6 near node_3 but lower height to balance forces and reduce member lengths. Define members: (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), (node_1-node_6), (node_6-node_2), (node_6-node_4), (node_4-node_3). Use areas selected from given set to stay within stress and mass limits.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Removing node_5 removes high-mass members and zero-load members. Intermediate node_6 allows force redistribution with shorter members and smaller areas. Elevating node_4 slightly above load node_3 creates a strong truss triangle for load transfer. Areas chosen starting from lower IDs (0-3) to keep mass low while meeting stress needs.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Length calculations (approx): node_1-node_3 ~2; node_3-node_2 ~4; node_1-node_6 ~2.8; node_6-node_2 ~3.5; node_6-node_4 ~1; node_4-node_3 ~1.8. Use areas: members in compression/tension dictated by FEM can use areas 1 or 2 mostly, critical members use 3. Total mass estimated well below 30. Max stress assessed to remain <20 due to lower areas and better geometry.",\n\n  "calculation": "Mass ~ sum(length × area). Approximate member lengths and areas: m1 (node_1-node_3, length 2.0, area 2) = 3.52; m2 (node_3-node_2, length 4.0, area 2) = 7.04; m3 (node_1-node_6, length 2.8, area 1) = 0.55; m4 (node_6-node_2, length 3.5, area 1) = 0.68; m5 (node_6-node_4, length 1.0, area 2) = 0.78; m6 (node_4-node_3, length 1.8, area 1) = 0.35; total mass ~12.92 < 30.
