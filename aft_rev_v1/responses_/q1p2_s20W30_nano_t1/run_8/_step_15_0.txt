  "preamble": "Optimize nodal positions and member areas for stress minimization within mass and stress limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress now 13.92 < 20, mass 26.32 < 30, constraints met. Current stresses in some members near ±14, leaving margin. Load on node_3 fixed; support nodes fixed. Additional node and members added in iteration 14 improved truss. Current max stress from member_5 with area 2. Possibly reduce stress by repositioning nodes 4,7,8 and resizing areas.",
  
  "analysis": "Members with highest compressive stress: member_5 (-13.92) and tension: member_3 (12.30). Members have area selections {1,2,3}. Member_5 area 2 might be increased if mass budget allows to reduce stress. Node_4,7,8 can move slightly to improve force paths and reduce stress concentrations. Member_5 (node_4 to node_7) compressive stress is maximal. Possibly reducing length or increasing area can reduce stress. Node_8 added to improve force flow but member_10 has low area (1). Possibly increasing member_10 area, rebalancing member_5 area, and adjusting nodes 7 and 8 positions downward to reduce compressive forces. Maintain node_3 at (2.0,0), supports fixed. Constraints: no exceed stress ±20, mass ≤30.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Constrain movements of nodes 4,7,8 only. Consider slight horizontal and vertical adjustments within ±0.3 units to balance forces. Member area choices: costs increase with higher area, careful to balance mass and stress. Member lengths and orientation affect axial force and stress.",
  
  "reasoning": "To reduce compressive stress in member_5, increase area from 2 to 3 if mass budget allows, adjusting node_7 closer vertically to node_4 to shorten member length slightly; reposition node_8 downwards and slightly left to reduce tensile forces in member_3 and member_8. Increase member_10 area (node_8 to node_7) from 1 to 2 to improve force path and reduce local stress. Decrease member_4 area from 3 to 2 to balance mass increase if possible. Adjust node_4 slightly down (around y=1.65) and node_7 downward/y left (x=2.30,y=1.1), node_8 downward (x=2.50,y=1.8). Evaluate estimated mass and stress improvements after changes.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member_mass = length * area_factor. Current total mass 26.32, increasing area of few members (5 to 3, 10 to 2) plus minor adjustments. Member_5 length approx = sqrt((3.2-2.4)^2 + (1.8-1.3)^2) = sqrt(0.64+0.25)=0.905. Mass increase for member_5 from area 2 (0.782) to 3 (1.759): mass ∆ ≈ 0.905*(1.759-0.782)=0.885 increase. Member_10 length approx = sqrt((2.8-2.4)^2+(2.0-1.3)^2)= sqrt(0.16+0.49)=0.806, area increase from 1 (0.195) to 2 (0.782) mass ∆≈ 0.806*(0.782-0.195)=0.479. Total increase ~1.36 approx; can reduce member_4 from 3 (1.759) to 2 (0.782), length = sqrt((3.2-3.0)^2+(1.8-1.3)^2)=~0.54, mass saved ≈ 0.54*(1.759 - 0.782) = 0.526. Net increase about 0.830, total mass ~27.15 < 30 feasible.",
  
  "calculation": "Increase member_5 area to '3', member_10 to '2', decrease member_4 to '2'. Adjust node_4: y=1.65 (from 1.8), x=3.2 fixed; node_7: x=2.3 (from 2.4), y=1.1 (from 1.3); node_8: x=2.5 (from 2.8), y=1.8 (from 2.0). These should reduce compressive stress in member_5 and tensile stress in member_3 and member_8, improving force equilibrium and reducing max stress. Mass remains under limit after area changes. Load and support nodes remain fixed. Structure remains closed and no duplicate members or nodes added/removed. Recalculate mass and predicted stress reduction expected.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Final node positions and member areas improve stress distribution and keep mass under 30. Max stress expected <14 MPa from past steps and modifications. Given iteration 14 max stress 13.92 and changes move stresses closer to uniform distribution. Stop after this iteration if max stress < 20 and mass < 30 confirmed.",
