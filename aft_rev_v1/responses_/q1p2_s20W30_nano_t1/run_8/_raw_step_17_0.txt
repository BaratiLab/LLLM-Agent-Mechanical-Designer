Load at node_3 and supports fixed. Moving free nodes 4,7,8 to balance stress and reduce peak stress.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High stresses are around members connected to node_4, node_7, and node_8. Reducing height of node_4 and adjusting positions of node_7 and node_8 closer to load path can improve load distribution and reduce max tensile stress at member_3 (node_1-node_4).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_3 (node_1-node_4) stress is max tensile (14.2). Members near node_7 and node_8 carry moderate stresses. Decreasing node_4 y slightly can reduce tensile stress by shortening member_3 and redistributing forces. Move node_7 slightly left and down, node_8 slightly left and up to improve triangulation and support paths.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Optimization limited by fixed supports and load node. Areas can remain same or be slightly reduced for less stressed members. Geometry plays important role here. Small nodal position changes could optimize force paths and reduce peak stresses. Keep mass below 30, already satisfied. Use precise floats.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Adjust node_4 from (3.2,1.5) to around (3.15,1.38), node_7 from (2.3,1.0) to (2.2,0.85), node_8 from (2.6,1.7) to (2.45,1.75). Maintain the same member connections and areas. Estimate small decrease of stress in member_3 and moderate in others. Slight decrease in mass by improving load path but mainly stress optimization focus.",\n\n  "calculation": "Moving node_4 down and slightly left reduces axial length of high stress member_3 lowering its stress. Shifting node_7 left and down improves force angles and reduces tensile and compressive peaks. Adjust node_8 left and slightly up to improve triangulation. Mass remains ~24.7 as member lengths change slightly. Stress reduction expected to bring max stress below 14. Council with load path and triangular stability.", \n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no constraints violated. Areas reused. No duplicate nodes or members.
