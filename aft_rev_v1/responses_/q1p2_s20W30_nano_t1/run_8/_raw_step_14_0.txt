Mass 21.47 is within limit. Load at node_3 (-10, -45°). Nodes fixed at node_1 and node_2. Members mostly area 1 to 3. Stress highly tensile/compressive on some diagonals. Truss lacks sufficient vertical triangulation and member sizing to reduce stress concentration.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Improve structure by adding bracing nodes and members near load node_3 to better distribute forces and reduce stress. Reduce area on highly stressed members if possible. Maintain or slightly add mass if stress reduction requires. Use higher area in critical members but keep mass under 30. Introduce additional nodes vertically above and between node_3 and node_4. Ensure no redundancy or unstable elements.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add one node above node_3 towards node_4 at (2.8, 2.0) to improve load path. Modify members to form triangulated frames: connect node_3 to new node, new node to node_4, new node to node_7, keep existing lower members. Adjust member areas to control stress: use low/medium areas for longer members, higher areas on highly loaded short members, avoid oversizing others. Keep existing supports and load nodes fixed. Remove low efficiency members if needed.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node above load node improves triangulation and reduces bending in members. Provides alternative load paths and reduces peak tensile/compressive stresses. Choosing areas from given discrete sizes allows balancing mass and strength. Smaller areas on long members with small forces reduce mass. Critical members with high stress get medium area. This reduces max stress below ±20 and keeps mass under 30. Avoids current problem of overstressed node_4-node_7 member.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "New node placement: node_8=(2.8, 2.0).

Areas assigned for stress optimization: node_4-node_7 area 2, critical members near load node area 3, others area 1 or 2. Calculate member lengths and estimate mass. Estimation: length(node_4-node_7)=sqrt((3.2-2.4)^2+(1.8-1.3)^2)=0.943. member_mass = length * area_factor. Total mass calculated must be ≤ 30.
