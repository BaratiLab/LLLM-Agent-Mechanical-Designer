Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Current mass ~11, stress max 52 >20 allowed. Areas max 4.887 used mostly (area id 2=0.782). Need stress reduction and stable design.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current design over-stressed in member_6 (-52) and member_5 (30.9). Members with high stress too slender or poorly oriented. The diagonal member_6 is critical. Adding intermediate nodes and redesigning member topology can distribute forces better and reduce peak stress. Member areas used currently are not optimal given stresses. Existing load/support nodes fixed. Current nodes node_4 and node_6 close in height and position but yield high stress. Redesign should add one more node between supports to form stable triangle panels, increase area in highly stressed members, possibly remove low-stress redundant members, and rebalance member lengths and angles.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress: add a third node at mid-span height to create two balanced triangles. Add members to form lower triangle and reduce tension in bottom chord. Use larger areas on highly stressed members (area_id 4 at 3.128 or higher). Keep members under stress limits by redistributing forces through triangular geometry.",\n\n    "proposal": "Add node_5 at (3.0, 1.8). Use members: node_1-node_3 (area 3), node_3-node_2 (area 3), node_1-node_5 (area 4), node_5-node_2 (area 4), node_3-node_5 (area 2), node_5-node_4 (area 2), node_4-node_3 (area 1). Remove node_6 and corresponding members. This creates two lower triangles and one upper triangle for force distribution.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Adding node_5 at intermediate height balances load path. Larger cross sections (area_id 3 or 4) for direct chords reduces stresses. Smaller cross sections for vertical/diagonal thinner members keep mass low. Triangular configuration efficiently transfers loads. Removing node_6 reduces redundant paths with high stressed slender members. Calculated member lengths and cross section areas control stress. Total mass estimated under 30 with these area choices.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approx: n1-n3 =2m, n3-n2=4m, n1-n5= ~ (3²+1.8²)^0.5=3.48m, n5-n2 ~ (3²+1.8²)^0.5=3.48m, n3-n5=1.8m, n5-n4 ~ (0.0²+0.7²)^0.5=0.7m, n4-n3 ~ 2.5m. Approx mass = Σ length * area (area factor per id). Using id 3=1.759, id 4=3.128, id 2=0.782, id 1=0.195. Mass approx: (2+4)*1.759 + (3.48*2)*3.128 + 1.8*0.782 + 0.7*0.782 + 2.5*0.195 ≈ under 30.
