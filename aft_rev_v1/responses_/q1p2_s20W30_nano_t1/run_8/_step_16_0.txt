  "preamble": "Refine node positions inside domain aiming to minimize max stress while staying within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 13.15 < 20 limit. Mass 25.14 < 30 limit. Load at node_3 fixed. Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 fixed.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is controlled but still mostly from member_3 (node_1-node_4) 13.15 and member_6 (node_7-node_2) 10.58. Node_4 and node_7 positions can be adjusted to better distribute load and reduce these stresses. Also member_5 (node_4-node_7) has moderate compression -6.89. Slightly lowering node_4â€™s vertical coordinate and shifting nodes 7 and 8 to improve geometry can reduce stress concentrations. Areas are mostly mid-range (2-3). Total mass is comfortable below limit, so we can maintain similar cross-section sizes or reduce slightly on lower stress members.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing tension/compression imbalance on nodes 4 and 7 by slight geometric adjustments: decrease node_4 y from 1.65 to ~1.5; node_7 y from 1.1 to ~1.0; node_8 x from 2.5 to 2.6, y from 1.8 to 1.7 to improve triangular stability and load paths.",
  
  "reasoning": "Lowering node_4 reduces bending lever arm and may reduce stress in member_3 and member_5. Slightly lowering node_7 reduces tension in member_6 (node_7-node_2). Adjusting node_8 position ensures no member degeneration and maintains closed truss shape and stable geometry. All load and supports fixed as required. Area selections remain consistent for efficiency. Members with low stress (member_9, member_10) retain small cross sections (area 2 or 1).",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Check that no member length drastically changes to keep mass stable. Calculate new member lengths and estimate updated mass: slight changes in y of 0.1-0.15 reduce member lengths by ~5-10%. Mass expected to remain below 30. Expect max stress dropdown below current 13.15 with better node geometry and load path.",
  
  "calculation": "Proposed node changes:\nnode_4: from (3.2, 1.65) to (3.2, 1.50)\nnode_7: from (2.3, 1.1) to (2.3, 1.00)\nnode_8: from (2.5, 1.8) to (2.6, 1.7)\nKeep other node positions same.\nMembers and their connectivity remain same, areas unchanged for stable mass and stress distribution.\nEstimated total mass ~25.0 or less, max stress likely decreases below 13.0.\nThis small position refinement effectively reduces leverage effect and member elongation under load.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no supports or loads moved; closed truss topology maintained with existing members and nodes; no duplicate members or nodes; areas from specified set used. Constraints maintained with margin.",
