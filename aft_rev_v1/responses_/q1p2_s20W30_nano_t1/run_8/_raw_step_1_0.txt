Supports at nodes 1(pinned) and 2(roller). Current max stress 34.19 exceeds ±20. Mass is within limit. Need to reduce stress and possibly redistribute forces by topology change.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current structure\'s max stress is driven by member_3 (node_1-node_4), which is overstressed at 34.19. Members connected to load node_3 carry moderate stress but member_3 is critical. Current trapezoidal configuration with single top node_4 provides limited load path, causing stress concentration. The allowable stress limit is ±20, so member_3 must be reinforced or load path diversified. Mass allowable is high (30), current mass 8.82 suggests room for adding or resizing members.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Options: Add a new node between node_3 and node_4 or add a diagonal member from node_3 to node_2 top or from node_3 to node_1 top to reduce member_3 load. Increasing area on member_3 alone is constrained by mass and available sections. Adding member from node_3 to node_4 with different area or adding node close to node_4 to form a triangle can improve stress distribution.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add an intermediate node between node_3 and node_4 at (2.5, 1.5) to split the long member_3 into two shorter members. Connect node_3 to new node_5 and node_5 to node_4. Resize members using area ids focusing on reducing stress in member_3 equivalents. Maintain members from node_1 and node_2 to node_4 for support distribution. Use areas higher for high stress members but stay within mass limit by using smaller areas elsewhere.",\n\n  "reasoning": "By introducing node_5, the long diagonal member_3 is split, reducing effective length and bending moments, lowering peak stresses. Additional member from node_3 to node_5 creates alternate load path, reducing stress on critical member. The topology change evenly distributes forces, lowering max stress below 20. Using intermediate cross-section sizes keeps mass acceptably low. Member lengths recalculated and cross-section areas chosen to balance stress and mass constraints.
