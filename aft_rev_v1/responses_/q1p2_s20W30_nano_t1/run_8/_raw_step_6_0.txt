Some members have zero or very low stress (member_2), indicating overdesign. Node_5 at (1.5,1.8) and node_6 at (3.6,1.5) can be repositioned to better optimize force paths and lower member areas.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Aim to reduce areas for members with low stress to decrease mass, lower stress concentration by slight nodal repositioning. Consider improving geometry to distribute loads better. Maintain closed topology with 7 members and 6 nodes. Keep load/support nodes fixed.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Reducing member areas with low stress and adjusting nodes 5 and 6 may balance forces better and reduce stress in member_5 (-3.22) which is max stress currently. Slightly raising node_6 and shifting node_5 closer to node_3 aids force paths. Member_1 and member_2 areas can be reduced from 4 to 3 if stress remains acceptable.
