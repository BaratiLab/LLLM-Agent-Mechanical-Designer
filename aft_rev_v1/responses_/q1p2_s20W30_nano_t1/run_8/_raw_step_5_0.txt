Current max stress very high (145.88) violating ±20. Mass 7.54 < 30 allowing increased area or member length for stress reduction.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high stress in member_3 (node_1 to node_6) and member_4 (node_6 to node_2). Members with area \'1\' likely undersized. Members from supports to midnodes carry unexpected high load. Number of intermediate nodes limited. Need to redistribute members and increase areas where highly stressed. Structure spans 6 units horizontally with load at 2m, based on history node_4 and node_6 positions tried but still failed stress limits. High stress member_3 shows poor load path on left side.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Changing node_6 position to higher Y or adding a new node between node_1 and node_3 can better spread load. Areas on high stress members must increase to at least 4 (area=3.128) or 5 (4.887). Avoid long slender members causing high stress. Pick triangular stable configurations to reduce bending effect.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add one intermediate node near (1.5,1.8) to form better triangular elements near node_1 and node_3. Use members from node_1 to new node, new node to node_3, node_3 to node_4 (at 3,2.4), node_4 to node_2, and node_6 at (3.6,1.5) linked to nodes 3 and 2 for support. Assign areas: high stress members with area \'4\' (3.128) or \'5\' (4.887), others smaller. Remove member_3 and member_4 of previous design (node_1-node_6, node_6-node_2) since node_6 position changed. Final design with load path node_1->new node->node_3->node_4->node_2 and node_6 connected to node_3 and node_2 to form stable sub-triangle.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "New nodes increase number of triangular load paths distributing forces, reducing max stress. Increasing areas on heavily stressed members reduces stresses below ±20. Using area \'4\' and \'5\' strikes balance between mass and strength. Keeping load/support nodes fixed meets instructions. Added nodes placed with precise float coords to achieve stable geometry with moderate member lengths. Configuration is statically determinate and stable, reducing bending stresses.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Areas: \'0\'=1, \'1\'~0.195, \'2\'~0.782, \'3\'~1.759, \'4\'~3.128, \'5\'~4.887; max stress ±20; mass ≤30 = sum(member length × area). Node positions and member connections designed to form triangles and transfer load efficiently. Members parallel to x-axis low load but need larger area on load path members. Estimate member lengths to not exceed mass when multiplied by area.",\n\n  "calculation": "Node distances and areas: e.g., node_1(0,0) to new_node(1.5,1.8) length ~2.34 × area 4 = 9.36 mass contribution. Similarly compute others. Total mass estimated ~25 below 30 limit. Higher area on critical members reduces stress to ≤20. Nodes fixed for loading/support. Triangular system ensures forces split and compressive/tensile forces balanced.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate members or nodes. Node positions in float.
