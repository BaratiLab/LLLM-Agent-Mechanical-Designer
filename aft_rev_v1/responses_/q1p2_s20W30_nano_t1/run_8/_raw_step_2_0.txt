Current max stress 34.2 too high, mass 11.9 ok. Load at node_3, pinned support at node_1, roller at node_2. Existing nodes fixed at supports and load. Added node_5 at (2.5,1.5) not enough to reduce stress below limit. Areas from given set. Members should form stable triangulated geometry distributing load.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High tensile stress at member_5 (node_1-node_4) at 34.2 exceeds limit. Member_6 and others well below max stress allowed. Mass is low, room to increase area or add members. Node_5 placement and members connecting nodes 3-5 and 5-4 have low stress, so better stress path needed. Existing top node_4 at (3,3) too far, causing high stress in member_5. Need to reposition internal nodes or add one more node to improve force path, reduce length and stress in critical member.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving intermediate nodes closer to load and supports for shorter members. Adding one more node between node_4 and base line to create multiple load paths. Increase area in critical members but keep others lighter. Remove redundant members causing unnecessary load on member_5. Possibly remove members 5 and 6, add members from node_3 to new node and from new node to supports to redistribute forces.",\n\n  "proposal": "Maintain node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Add new internal node_6 at (3.2, 2.0). Relocate node_4 slightly to (3.0, 2.5) for compact truss. Members: connect node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_6, node_6-node_2, node_6-node_4, node_4-node_3. This creates two triangles sharing node_6 and node_4, shorter members, better force distribution. Select moderate areas (area_id \'2\' or \'3\') for longer members, \'1\' or \'0\' for shorter ones. Remove members with excessive stress from previous design.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Removing overly stressed diagonal member_5 from node_1 to node_4 prevents overload. Adding node_6 closer to load and supports improves load transfer. Smaller member lengths reduce bending moments and axial stress. Areas chosen to ensure stress under ±20 but keep mass minimal. Triangles ensure structural stability. Geometry aligns with supports and load position, optimizing force flow. Mass remains below 30 due to moderate areas and shorter members. Load at node_3 transmitted to supports through stable triangulation.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_3:2m, node_3-node_2:4m, node_1-node_6:√((3.2)^2 + (2)^2)=~3.72m, node_6-node_2:√((2.8)^2 + (2)^2)=~3.44m, node_6-node_4:√((0.2)^2 + (0.5)^2)=~0.54m, node_4-node_3:√((0)^2 + (0.5)^2)=0.5m. Assign area ids: \'2\' for longer members, \'1\' for shorter. Total estimated mass sum(length*area) ≈ (2*0.782)+(4*0.782)+(3.72*0.782)+(3.44*0.782)+(0.54*0.195)+(0.5*0.195)=~11.5 <30.
