  "preamble": "Optimize node positions and member areas to further reduce stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 3.22 within ±20 allowed, total mass 29.7 < 30 max. Load node_3 at (2,0) fixed; supports at node_1 (0,0) pinned and node_2 (6,0) roller fixed. Node_5 and node_6 movable.",
  
  "analysis": "Stresses are low and within limits, but member_1 and member_2 have large areas (4) causing high mass. Some members have zero or very low stress (member_2), indicating overdesign. Node_5 at (1.5,1.8) and node_6 at (3.6,1.5) can be repositioned to better optimize force paths and lower member areas.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Aim to reduce areas for members with low stress to decrease mass, lower stress concentration by slight nodal repositioning. Consider improving geometry to distribute loads better. Maintain closed topology with 7 members and 6 nodes. Keep load/support nodes fixed.",

  "reasoning": "Reducing member areas with low stress and adjusting nodes 5 and 6 may balance forces better and reduce stress in member_5 (-3.22) which is max stress currently. Slightly raising node_6 and shifting node_5 closer to node_3 aids force paths. Member_1 and member_2 areas can be reduced from 4 to 3 if stress remains acceptable. Adjust members 5, 6, 7 areas accordingly. Anticipate marginal mass reduction while maintaining stresses below 20.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths and recompute approximate stresses based on geometry change. Member mass proportional to length × area factor. Adjust node_5 from (1.5,1.8) to (1.7,1.9) and node_6 from (3.6,1.5) to (3.4,1.7). Reduce area of members_1 and _2 from '4' to '3'. Check total mass with updated areas and lengths <30.",

  "calculation": "Member lengths approx:\n- member_1 (node_1 to node_5): dist ~ sqrt(1.7² + 1.9²) ≈ 2.55\n- member_2 (node_5 to node_3): dist ~ sqrt((2-1.7)² + (0-1.9)²) ≈ 1.91\nMass member_1 with area 3: 2.55 × 1.759 = 4.49\nMass member_2 with area 3: 1.91 × 1.759 = 3.36\nReduced mass vs prior 7.33 and 5.84, saving ~5.5 mass units.\nOthers similar or slightly varied in length.\nRecalculate total mass estimated around 24-25 after changes.\nMax stress expected to remain below 4 based on prior stress margin.\nThis is optimal as further reduction risks stress increase or violating geometrical constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Nodes load/support fixed. Adjust nodes 5,6 and reduce member_1 and 2 areas. Member areas chosen from allowed set. Check no duplicate members. Structure remains closed with 7 members. Constraints preserved.",
