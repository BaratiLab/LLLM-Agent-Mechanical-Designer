Adjust node_5 within limits. Area choices available. Stress on member_4 high. Member_3 area large (3), try reducing or redistribute.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_4 (node_2-node_5) area=1 has high tensile stress 15.48 close to limit. Member_3 (node_1-node_5) has moderate stress 5.06 with large area 3. Other members have lower stress but member_5 (node_3-node_5) is in compression ~-11.58 with smaller area 2. Node_5 raised from 2.0 to 2.5 increased mass and stress on member_4. Possibly reduce node_5 y slightly or move closer horizontally to reduce stress on member_4. Areas can be adjusted to reduce member_4 stress by increasing, but mass will increase. Alternatively, reduce member_3 area to lower mass. Member lengths can be optimized by repositioning node_5.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try lowering node_5 y-position to about 2.2-2.3 to reduce tension on member_4. Adjust area of member_4 to 2 for better tension capacity (mass impact is small: 0.624 to ~2.503). Reduce area of member_3 from 3 to 2 to lower mass. Check node_5 x-position to balance length of members 3 and 4 so stress distribution is better.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Reducing node_5 y from 2.5 to ~2.25 reduces length of member_4, lowering tensile stress. Increasing member_4 area from 1 to 2 (0.195 to 0.782) boosts capacity with slight mass increase but still under total mass limit. Reducing member_3 area from 3 to 2 reduces mass because member_3 is compressive but stress is low (~5.06). Overall, these changes will likely reduce max stress and mass closer to optimal within constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approx: member_4 length = sqrt((6-4)^2 + (0-2.25)^2) ~ sqrt(4 + 5.06) = sqrt(9.06) ~3.01; compare to current 3.20 at y=2.5. Member_3 length = sqrt((4-0)^2 + (2.25-0)^2) = sqrt(16 + 5.06) = sqrt(21.06) ~4.59, slightly shorter than current at y=2.5 (~4.72). Stress proportional to force / area / length, adjusting area and length reduces stresses.",\n\n  "calculation": "New node_5: (4.0, 2.25). Member area changes: member_4 from \'1\'->\'2\'; member_3 from \'3\'->\'2\'. Areas for others unchanged. Estimated total_mass reduces approx by 8.297->5.349 (member_3), member_4 mass increases from 0.624->2.503, net mass ~17.225 < 18.07 previous and < 30 limit.
