Load at node_3, supports fixed. Nodes at fixed load/support unchanged; only node_5 movable.",\n\n  "analysis": "Member stresses are well within allowable ±20 limits, loads and supports unchanged per instructions. Current max stress (12.3) is significantly below limit, mass (14.94) less than half max allowed. Node_5 position optimized in previous iterations; member areas reasonably assigned.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further node_5 adjustment unlikely to significantly reduce max stress below current 12.3. Areas are mostly moderate; using larger areas would increase mass unnecessarily.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Maintaining fixed load/support nodes ensures boundary conditions. Node_5 at (4.0,2.25) balances axial stiffness in members connected to it reducing stress concentrations. Smaller area members (area 2 or 3) provide adequate stiffness without excess mass. With max stress < 20 and total mass < 30, and no constraints violated, structure is optimal for given conditions.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "No duplicated member connections; members all connect distinct nodes. Areas selected from given discrete set. Node_5 moved within allowable range in previous iteration. Mass calculated as sum of length × assigned area. Stress minimized by geometric layout reducing eccentricities and bending moments.",\n\n  "calculation": "Max stress = 12.3 < 20 compressive/tensile limit; total mass = 14.94 < 30.
