  "preamble": "Optimized 2D truss with minimal stress and mass within constraints.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 12.3 < 20, total mass 14.94 < 30; constraints met. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Nodes at fixed load/support unchanged; only node_5 movable.",

  "analysis": "Member stresses are well within allowable ±20 limits, loads and supports unchanged per instructions. Current max stress (12.3) is significantly below limit, mass (14.94) less than half max allowed. Node_5 position optimized in previous iterations; member areas reasonably assigned.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Further node_5 adjustment unlikely to significantly reduce max stress below current 12.3. Areas are mostly moderate; using larger areas would increase mass unnecessarily.",

  "reasoning": "Maintaining fixed load/support nodes ensures boundary conditions. Node_5 at (4.0,2.25) balances axial stiffness in members connected to it reducing stress concentrations. Smaller area members (area 2 or 3) provide adequate stiffness without excess mass. With max stress < 20 and total mass < 30, and no constraints violated, structure is optimal for given conditions.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "No duplicated member connections; members all connect distinct nodes. Areas selected from given discrete set. Node_5 moved within allowable range in previous iteration. Mass calculated as sum of length × assigned area. Stress minimized by geometric layout reducing eccentricities and bending moments.",

  "calculation": "Max stress = 12.3 < 20 compressive/tensile limit; total mass = 14.94 < 30. No constraint violated. Slight changes to node_5 position produce marginal effects previously and may destabilize stress distribution.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Design is stable, minimal stress under loads, total mass efficient, no constraints broken. Further iteration unlikely to produce meaningful improvement.",

  "node_dict": {
    "node_1": (0.0, 0.0),  # Support pinned, fixed position
    "node_2": (6.0, 0.0),  # Support roller, fixed position

    "node_5": (4.0, 2.25)  # Optimized node position to balance load transfer and stress distribution

  "member_dict": {
    "member_1": ("node_1", "node_3", "3"),  # Moderate area for axial force transfer
    "member_2": ("node_3", "node_2", "2"),  # Slightly smaller area reducing mass with adequate strength
    "member_3": ("node_1", "node_5", "2"),  # Moderate area to balance load path
    "member_4": ("node_2", "node_5", "2"),  # Same as above for symmetry and stiffness
