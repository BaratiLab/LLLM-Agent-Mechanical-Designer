Mass is well below max (17.3 < 30), max stress about 13.5 < 20 allowed. Member_3 is max stressed (13.5 tensile).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress far from limit but uneven stress distribution, member_3 is high tension. Node_5 is only free node; moving it can redistribute forces. Current members mostly area_id 2 or 3; mass can be adjusted with area changes. Close truss formed by nodes (node_1-node_3-node_5-node_2-node_1).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Shift node_5 slightly higher and towards node_3 to reduce tensile stress on member_3 and compressive stress on member_5. Consider reducing area of low-stressed members to reduce mass or increase areas strategically to reduce max stress without exceeding mass limit.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_3 has highest tensile stress; moving node_5 closer to node_3 may reduce this. Members connected to node_5 can share load better. Keep load/support nodes fixed per instruction. Areas for member_3 can be increased to reduce stress, but mass must stay <=30.

Area changes: increase member_3 area from 2 to 3, decrease member_4 area from 3 to 2 or 1, member_5 area keep at 2.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Length calculations: \\n- l_m3 (node_1-node_5) = sqrt((4-0)^2+(2.5-0)^2) = sqrt(16+6.25)= sqrt(22.25)=4.716\\n- l_m5 (node_3-node_5) = sqrt((4-2)^2+(2.5-0)^2)=sqrt(4+6.25)=sqrt(10.25)=3.201\\n- l_m4 (node_2-node_5)= sqrt((6-4)^2+(0-2.5)^2)= sqrt(4+6.25)=3.201\\n Mass = sum(length * area_density).
