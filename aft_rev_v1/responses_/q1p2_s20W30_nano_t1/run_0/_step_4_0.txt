  "preamble": "Optimize stress by repositioning free node and adjusting member areas within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current truss is statically determinate, load at node_3, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Mass is well below max (17.3 < 30), max stress about 13.5 < 20 allowed. Member_3 is max stressed (13.5 tensile).",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress far from limit but uneven stress distribution, member_3 is high tension. Node_5 is only free node; moving it can redistribute forces. Current members mostly area_id 2 or 3; mass can be adjusted with area changes. Close truss formed by nodes (node_1-node_3-node_5-node_2-node_1).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Shift node_5 slightly higher and towards node_3 to reduce tensile stress on member_3 and compressive stress on member_5. Consider reducing area of low-stressed members to reduce mass or increase areas strategically to reduce max stress without exceeding mass limit.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_3 has highest tensile stress; moving node_5 closer to node_3 may reduce this. Members connected to node_5 can share load better. Keep load/support nodes fixed per instruction. Areas for member_3 can be increased to reduce stress, but mass must stay <=30. Possibly decrease member_4 area as its stress is low. Adjust areas for balance.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: m3 ~ length(node_1-node_5), m5 ~ length(node_3-node_5), m4 ~ length(node_2-node_5). Current node_5 at (4,2). Try (4.0,2.5) to shift load distribution. Area changes: increase member_3 area from 2 to 3, decrease member_4 area from 3 to 2 or 1, member_5 area keep at 2.",
  
  "calculation": "Length calculations: \n- l_m3 (node_1-node_5) = sqrt((4-0)^2+(2.5-0)^2) = sqrt(16+6.25)= sqrt(22.25)=4.716\n- l_m5 (node_3-node_5) = sqrt((4-2)^2+(2.5-0)^2)=sqrt(4+6.25)=sqrt(10.25)=3.201\n- l_m4 (node_2-node_5)= sqrt((6-4)^2+(0-2.5)^2)= sqrt(4+6.25)=3.201\n Mass = sum(length * area_density). Use for areas: \n - member_1: area 3 (1.759), length=2 (node_1-node_3): mass=3.518\n - member_2: area 2 (0.782), length=4 (node_3-node_2): 3.128\n - member_3: area 3 (1.759), length~4.716: 8.279\n - member_4: area 1 (0.195), length~3.201: 0.624\n - member_5: area 2 (0.782), length~3.201: 2.502\n Total mass ~3.518 +3.128 +8.279 +0.624 +2.502=17.95 <30, ok.\nStress estimation: Increasing member_3 area reduces stress roughly by ratio area_new/area_old=3/2=1.5 times reduction. Member_4 low stress will increase if area reduced, but should be safe. Move node_5 upward to 2.5 reduces tension in member_3. This should reduce max stress below previous 13.48.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Move node_5 upwards from (4,2) to (4,2.5). Increase member_3 area from 2 to 3 to reduce tensile stress. Reduce member_4 area from 3 to 1. Keep other areas unchanged. Expected mass within limit, stress balanced better.",
