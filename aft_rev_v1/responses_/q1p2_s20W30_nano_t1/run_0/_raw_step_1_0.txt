Current max stress 29.05 > 20 limit, mass 11.84 < 30 limit. Need to reduce stress mostly on member_2 and member_3.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High tensile stress on member_2 (29.05) and member_3 (20.15) suggests load path dominated there. Member_2 connects node_1 to node_4 vertically at 3m height. Member_3 connects node_2 to node_4 diagonally. Member_1 is a long horizontal member between node_1 and node_2. Member_4 links node_3 to node_4, member_5 horizontal from node_2 to node_3. Current structure tries to carry load with only one vertical top node (node_4).",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding an intermediate node higher than node_4 could reduce tension in member_2 and member_3 by creating a two-stage support path. Also, removing member_1 from area 2 (big area) and lowering its area might help reduce mass and redistribute stresses. Rationalize areas based on tension demands. Balanced triangular truss is optimal for such vertical load.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add a new node (node_5) at (4.0, 4.0) above node_4. Connect node_4 and node_5, node_2 and node_5. Adjust areas: lower member_2 and member_3 areas, increase member_4 and node_5 related members. Remove or reduce area of member_1 from \'2\' to \'1\' to reduce mass. Keep member_5 to maintain horizontal support near load node_3.",\n\n  "reasoning": "By adding node_5 elevated further, the vertical and diagonal load path splits reducing stress concentration on member_2 and member_3. Triangular configurations with nodes higher than load location improves stress distribution. Using smaller cross-section for long horizontal member_1 reduces mass without compromising support. Area selections balance tension/compression accounting for load direction. No changes on support and load nodes to honor constraints.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approx: \\n- member_1 (node_1-node_2): 6m, area 1 -> mass=6*0.195=1.17\\n- member_2 (node_1-node_4): length ~3.606m, area 0.782, mass=3.606*0.782=2.82\\n- member_3 (node_2-node_4): ~3.605m, area 0.782, mass ~2.82\\n- member_4 (node_3-node_4): 3m, area 3.128, mass=9.384\\n- member_5 (node_2-node_3): 4m, area 0.782, mass=3.128\\n- member_6 (node_4-node_5): length ~2.236m, area 1.759, mass ~3.93\\n- member_7 (node_2-node_5): length ~4.472m, area 1.759, mass ~7.86\\nTotal estimated mass ~31.2 (slightly above 30, can reduce member_4 area to 2) and stresses expected to be balanced within ±20.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Reduce member_4 area to \'2\' (0.782) mass contribution = 3 * 0.782 = 2.346; saves ~7 units.
