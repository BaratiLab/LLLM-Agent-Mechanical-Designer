Node_5 added in iteration_1 increased max stress and mass. Member sizing and geometry cause stress peak. Need to reduce max force in long bottom chord and improve force paths to spread stresses. Maintaining supports and load nodes fixed.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce length and load on node_1-node_2 by repositioning intermediate nodes.

Add node_4 at (2.5, 3.2) above bottom chord between node_1 and node_2 to form two triangles (node_1-node_4-node_3 and node_2-node_4-node_3).

Assign moderate areas to share load and reduce stress.",\n  "reasoning": "Triangular configurations optimize truss performance by better force flow and reducing bending. Moving node_4 slightly higher than previous and slightly right balances forces. Removing node_5 simplifies load path and reduces mass.
