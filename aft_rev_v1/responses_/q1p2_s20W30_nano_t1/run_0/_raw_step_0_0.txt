Constraints: max ±20 stress, max mass 30. Areas discrete from given set. Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Nodes: node_1 at (0,0) pinned support, node_2 at (6,0) roller support, node_3 at (2,0) load (-10 magnitude, -45°). Only 3 nodes, must connect all with minimal members to form closed truss. Closed truss simplest as triangle: members (1-2), (2-3), (3-1). Load on node_3, so members connected to node_3 critical for stress. Need to assign member areas considering length and stress to stay within constraints. Use static equilibrium assuming members only carry axial load. Mass estimated as sum(length*area). Stress = force / area, force from member axial reactions. Choose area from given discrete set to balance stress and mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Triangle formed by (0,0), (6,0), (2,0) all on x-axis is degenerate (colinear). Cannot form closed truss with 3 colinear nodes. Need to add a node off line to form a triangle that can carry loads effectively. Introduce node_4 vertically above node_3 to form stable triangle and avoid zero-area issues. Position node_4 say at (2.0, +3.0). Then members (1-4), (2-4), (3-4) plus base (1-2), (2-3), (3-1) considered. But instructions say not to change existing nodes. We can add nodes not forbidden. For closed truss, new nodes allowed. Then new structure with 4 nodes, forming a stable triangle with members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Since all initial nodes are colinear on x-axis, no closed truss with these 3 nodes only. Minimal stable truss is triangular, so add node_4 vertically at (2.0, 3.0). Members: base (1-2), and diagonal legs connecting 4 to 1, 2, and 3 to form closed figure involving loaded node_3. For conservative design, exclude member (3-1) to reduce mass as they lie on base line. Members chosen: (1-2), (1-4), (2-4), (3-4), and (2-3). Each member assigned area from given set to keep max stress within ±20. Lengths calculated from coordinates. Apply static equilibrium on loaded node_3 to estimate forces. Use axial member force = Load projection divided by cos or sin of angle of member to vertical/horizontal axis to approximate member forces. Areas selected so that stress = force / area ≤ 20. Summed mass ≤30. Use smaller areas for short members with low forces, larger areas for longer members or high force paths.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4 = (2.0, 3.0) (added). Members: m1: (1-2), length 6.0, base. m2: (1-4), length sqrt((2-0)^2 + (3-0)^2)=sqrt(4+9)=3.605. m3: (2-4), length sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-3)^2)=sqrt(16+9)=5.0. m4: (3-4), length sqrt((2-2)^2+(0-3)^2)=3.0. m5: (2-3), length |6-2|=4.0. Load on node_3: 10 magnitude at 45° down-left. Resolve into horizontal Fx = -10*cos45°=-7.07 left, vertical Fy = -10*sin45°=-7.07 down. Assuming equilibrium, member (3-4) takes most vertical load, member (2-3) takes horizontal. Estimate member forces: use equilibrium for node_3: sum forces = 0. Approximate axial forces: F34 vertical component = 7.07, F23 horizontal component =7.07. F23 force approx 7.07N, length 4. Area needed = force/stress_limit =7.07/20=0.3535. Choose area 0.782 (area_id \'2\'). F34 force approx 7.07N, length 3, area needed 0.3535, again choose 0.782. For base (1-2), carries reaction forces from supports: max force estimate up to reaction 10N, length 6, area requirement 0.5 approx, choose 0.782. For diagonals (1-4, 2-4), less force assumed approx 5N max, area 0.195 sufficient. Total mass = sum length * area = (6*0.782)+(3.605*0.195)+(5*0.195)+(3*0.782)+(4*0.782)=4.692 + 0.703 + 0.975 + 2.346 + 3.128= 11.844 < 30.
