  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to further reduce max stress while maintaining constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 14.855 < 20, total mass 13.375 < 30. Loaded node_3 fixed at (2,0), supports node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0) fixed. Members at area_id '2' (0.782). Goal: reduce max stress further by refining node_4 location.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_1 has highest compressive stress (-14.855) associated with node_3-node_1. Member_3 highest tensile stress (8.37) between node_1-node_4. Current node_4 position (2.7, 2.8) seems slightly low vertically and lateral positioning may be suboptimal, causing bending stress concentration at node_3. Members sized with area_id '2' (0.782) for all; potential to reduce or redistribute forces by adjusting node_4 vertically and horizontally within bounds.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Keeping node_3, node_1, node_2 fixed due to constraints. Adjust node_4 (x,y) to optimize geometry for stress reduction. Possibly increase vertical height slightly to improve load path and equilibrium; shift x closer towards center between node_1 and node_3 to reduce leverage on member_1.",

  "reasoning": "Increasing y of node_4 slightly can reduce bending in bottom chord members by improving triangular load distribution. Moving x-coordinate of node_4 closer to node_3 (but not too close) may reduce high axial stress on member_1. Avoid moving node_4 too close to node_1 or node_2 to maintain stable geometry. Maintain closed 2D truss with 5 members. Areas remain '2' for all in current design as mass and stress are balanced. Minor repositioning expected to lower max stress while keeping total mass constant.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Consider node_4 new position around (2.6 to 2.8, 3.0 to 3.2). Calculate approximate member lengths and stress distribution: Members lengths and forces dependent on x,y of node_4. Lengths: node_1-node_4 ~ sqrt((x_4-0)^2 + y_4^2), node_3-node_4 ~ sqrt((x_4 - 2)^2 + y_4^2), node_2-node_4 ~ sqrt((6 - x_4)^2 + y_4^2). Expect lowering stress in member_1 with increased y_4, proper x_4 displacement.",

  "calculation": "Set node_4 at (2.65, 3.1). Member lengths approx:  node_1-node_4 ~ sqrt(2.65^2 + 3.1^2)=4.07, node_3-node_4 ~ sqrt(0.35^2 + 3.1^2)=3.13, node_2-node_4 ~ sqrt(3.35^2 + 3.1^2)=4.56. Compared to prior (2.7,2.8), node_1-node_4 length increased (from ~3.9 to ~4.07), node_3-node_4 length decreased (from ~3.15 to ~3.13). This geometry should better distribute axial forces, reduce peak stress. Member areas kept at '2' (0.782) to satisfy mass and strength. Total mass expected ~13.3, max stress predicted to reduce below 14.8.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 repositioning respects fixed load/support nodes, no duplicate nodes/members; areas kept consistent. Mass and stress constraints satisfied. Improvement in max stress and equilibrium likely. Not final stop to allow further iteration if needed.",
