  "preamble": "Current truss with 4 nodes and 5 members meets constraints and low max stress.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 14.2 well below ±20 limit; total mass 13.93 <30. Nodes at fixed supports and load unchanged. Optimization aims to further reduce max stress by moving free node_4 while keeping truss closed.",
  
  "analysis": "Current structure uses 5 members connecting 4 nodes with cross member and symmetric layout. Max stress concentrated in member_1 in compression (-14.2). Member areas uniformly set to level '2' (0.782 area). Mass is moderate, no constraints violated. Load on node_3 causes larger stress in members connected to node_1 and node_3. Node_4 positioned at (2.65, 3.1). Previous iterations showed mass overshoot or stress >20 when adding extra nodes or increasing height.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Manual moves of node_4 upwards/downwards changed stresses but max stress remained ~14-15. Decreasing member areas below '2' may reduce mass but risk increasing stress. Members with lower stress (member_2, member_4) could potentially be assigned smaller area if still safe.",
  
  "reasoning": "With fixed load/support nodes, only node_4 can be moved. Further raising node_4 increases axial force in diagonal members raising stress; lowering node_4 reduces stress in top members but increases in bottom horizontal members. Current moderate (2.65,3.1) height balanced axial forces. Reducing cross-sectional area for lower-stress members risks stress violation. Therefore, uniform area '2' is justified for robustness. Mass and max stress constraints satisfied. Adding more members or nodes risks complexity and mass increase. Current design is a near-optimal balanced minimal structure preserving closure and constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress limit ±20, current max stress 14.2 at member_1. Total mass 13.93 with area level 2 (0.782) for all members. Member lengths moderate (~2-3.5). Load magnitude -10 at 45° on node_3. Moving node_4 gradually around (2.65,3.1) does not improve stress appreciably. Member areas all equal prevents localized overstress. Mass 13.93 far lower than 30 limit, so no risk of mass constraint. No redundant members reducing stress further identified.",
  
  "calculation": "No change in node positions done on supports or load nodes. Node_4 remains at (2.65,3.1). Member connections remain the same: members 1-5 connect node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4 with area_id='2' (area=0.782). Calculated stresses and mass satisfy all constraints. Maximum stress magnitude 14.195 < 20 limit.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Given constraints, no improvement from shifting node_4 or changing areas was found. Structure is stable, closed and meets all objectives. Stopping optimization.",
