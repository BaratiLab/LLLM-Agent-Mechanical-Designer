Current mass 58.2 exceeds limit; stress acceptable (max 12.51). Nodes not movable for load/support. Member areas can be reduced, structure simplified.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current structure has too large mass mainly due to large areas on members 3 and 4 (areas 4), and member lengths. Members 3 and 4 have low stresses ~1, so area can be reduced. The structure is complex with redundancies causing mass inflation. Nodes 4 and 5 located close vertically (4m y) may be optimized. Load at node 3 (-10, -45°) creates tension/compression in members radiating from node 3. Keeping pinned and roller supports at nodes 1 and 2 constrains base. To reduce mass, remove node_5 and associated members to simplify layout, reduce area of less stressed members, and shorten members if possible.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_5 to remove excess complexity and mass. Use a triangular truss with nodes 1,2,3,4 only. Keep node_4 at optimal vertical height for force transfer. Assign areas: members carrying high load to moderately sized areas, weak members to smaller areas. Recalculate estimated mass and stress accordingly.",\n\n  "proposal": "Structure with nodes 1, 2, 3, 4. Node_1 at (0.0, 0.0), node_2 at (6.0, 0.0), node_3 at (2.0, 0.0), node_4 moved slightly higher to (2.8, 3.5). Members: (1-3), (3-2), (1-4), (2-4), and (3-4). Areas: members 1 and 2 with area_id \'2\'=0.782, members 3 and 4 with area_id \'1\'=0.195, member 5 (3-4) area_id \'3\'=1.759.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Reducing node_5 removes 3 members with significant mass. Moving node_4 slightly up improves force transfer and reduces stress concentration. Use smaller areas on members 3 and 4 with low stress to reduce mass. Member connecting node_3 to node_4 kept moderate area for stability. Members along base (1-3 and 3-2) need moderate area due to load transfer. This layout balances mass reduction while keeping stresses within limits.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Length estimations: (1-3): 2.0m, (3-2): 4.0m, (1-4): ~4.5m, (2-4): ~3.9m, (3-4): ~3.5m. Member mass = sum(length * area_factor). Approximate mass from areas: member_1(2*0.782=1.564), member_2(4*0.782=3.128), member_3(4.5*0.195=0.8775), member_4(3.9*0.195=0.7605), member_5(3.5*1.759=6.157). Total~12.49, well below 30.
