Current max stress > 31 and mass ~8.7, need stress reduction.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High tensile stress on member_3 (node_1 to node_4) at 31.47 exceeds ±20 limit. Mass is reasonable but stress constraint violated. Load is on node_3 which is currently a bottom chord node. The top node (node_4) likely under high tension causing overstress. Current layout is a simple triangular truss with a node close to load, loads cause high member force in compression and tension. Modifying node_4 position can reduce stress by providing better force distribution and adding a diagonal or vertical member for load path. Member areas currently small for stressed members (area \'1\' for member_3).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing area on high stress members may help but increases mass. Moving node_4 to optimize geometry and adding possibly a new node for better force flow. Keeping supports fixed, adding a vertical or inclined node above node_3 for force flow might decrease stress on node_1-node_4 member.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add one node above node_3 to better distribute forces. Move node_4 vertically upward at (2.5, 4.0). Add new node_5 at (2.0, 4.0). Connect node_5 to node_1, node_2, and node_3 forming a two-story triangular truss. Adjust member areas to reduce stress below limits with minimum mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "By raising node_4 and adding node_5 directly above load node_3, load path is more direct vertical, reducing tension in longer bottom members. This also forms shorter members reducing force in each element. Use higher area for members under tension >20MPa and reduce for others. This geometry improves load transfer to supports and reduces max stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check lever arm and length for critical members. Use area up to 3.128 or 4.887 for high stress members to reduce stress magnitude. Calculate member length from node coordinates and area from given discrete set. Calculate mass = sum(length * area).
