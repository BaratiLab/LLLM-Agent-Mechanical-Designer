Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current mass 38.63 too heavy, stresses OK under ±20.",\n  "analysis": "Current design has excessive mass loaded in large area members at node_4 and node_5 connections. Stress well below limits, indicating overdesign. Reducing number of nodes and members, and using lower area indices feasible. Also, current node_4 and node_5 location cause heavier and longer members. Remove node_5, adjust node_4 to shorter height, simplify truss for a lighter structure while maintaining statical determinacy.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_5 to reduce mass, keep node_4 but closer to load line to reduce member length. Keep members connecting support nodes to load via node_3 and node_4. Employ mostly area_id \'2\' or \'3\' for balance of strength/mass. Minimize large combined areas like \'4\'.",\n  "proposal": "New structure: nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2.6,3.0). Members: node_1-node_3 area \'2\', node_3-node_2 area \'2\', node_1-node_4 area \'3\', node_2-node_4 area \'3\', node_3-node_4 area \'3\'. Removed node_5 and all related members. This shortens upper members and reduces mass significantly.",\n  "reasoning": "Using geometry, node_4 at moderate height 3.0 reduces length of inclined members limiting mass. Areas set to \'2\' for lower mass on chord members from nodes 1-3-2 and \'3\' on inclined members for needed strength. This balances stress below limits and reduces mass. Triangular geometry preserved for statically determinate structure. Load at node_3 transmitted effectively through node_4 to supports.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: m1=2.0 (node1-node3), m2=4.0 (node3-node2), m3=sqrt(2.6^2 + 3^2)=3.9789 (node1-node4), m4=sqrt((6-2.6)^2 + 3^2)=4.763 (node2-node4), m5=sqrt((2.6-2)^2 + 3^2)=3.043 (node3-node4). Mass = sum(length*area) conservatively estimated as sum(member_length*area_value). Choose areas \'2\'(0.782) for m1,m2, \'3\'(1.759) for m3,m4,m5.
