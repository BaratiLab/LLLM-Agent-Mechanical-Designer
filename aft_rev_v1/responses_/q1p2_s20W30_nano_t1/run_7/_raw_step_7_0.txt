Load at node_3 with angle -45°. Current node_4 at (2.6, 3) creates a triangle with base from 0 to 6. Members between nodes have relatively higher areas on diagonals. Observed compressive stress max at member_1 (-14.27). To reduce stress and mass, consider reducing member areas on less stressed members and adjusting node_4 vertical and lateral position to improve force distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Lowering node_4 close to node_3 vertically may lower member 1 stress. Increasing stiffness centrally might reduce stress in bottom chord member_1. Areas of members can be reduced from \'3\' (1.759) to \'2\' (0.782) or \'1\'(0.195) if load supports. Check if member_5 with stress -4.1 needs area 3 or can be reduced.",\n  "reasoning": "Member_1 is highest compressive stress; reducing stress here critical. Node_4 currently at (2.6, 3) - shifting slightly vertically downward towards 2.7-2.8 or slightly right towards 2.7-2.8 might balance forces better, shortening or orienting members for less bending. Bottom chord members_1 and 2 have area \'2\'. Diagonal members at area \'3\'. Slightly reducing diagonal areas or repositioning node_4 could reduce stress and mass. Avoid complex new nodes to keep design simple. Must keep nodes for load and supports fixed.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths with shifted node_4 between (2.7,2.7) and (2.8,3.0). Member mass = length * area coefficient * density (not given, so use area as proxy). Max stress < 20 must hold. Attempt reducing member_5 area from \'3\' to \'2\' if stress margin allows. Adjust node_4 position by small increments and recalc stresses.",\n  "calculation": "Shift node_4 to (2.7, 2.8) reducing vertical height, check member lengths: node_1-node_4 ~ sqrt(2.7²+2.8²)=3.88; node_2-node_4 ~ sqrt((6-2.7)²+2.8²)=4.25; node_3-node_4 ~ sqrt((2-2.7)²+2.8²)=2.89. Areas: member_1 and 2 keep \'2\'; member_3,4,5 set to \'2\' (0.782) to reduce mass. Recalculated mass roughly: sum(lengths*area coefficients): member_1: (2 * 0.782) ~1.56; member_3:3.88*0.782=3.03; member_4:4.25*0.782=3.32; member_5:2.89*0.782=2.26; member_2: same as current length ~4*0.782=3.12.
