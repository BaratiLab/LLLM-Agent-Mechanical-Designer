  "preamble": "Optimization for load at node_3 with pinned and roller support.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load magnitude -10N at 45° down-left at node_3, supports at nodes 1(pinned) and 2(roller). Constraints: max stress ±20 and total mass ≤30. Current max stress 21.6 >20, so modification needed. Current mass 18.4 <30, so mass is acceptable. Member_6 at max stress violation, so reconsider its area or topology.",
  
  "analysis": "Current structure shows overstress in member_6 (node_4-node_5). This member carries load poorly and causes violation. Members with high stress often in vertical or long diagonal members. Adding intermediate nodes to reduce member length and rearranging member connections to improve force distribution is beneficial. Increasing member areas will increase mass beyond safe limit; hence better topology preferred.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Propose removing node_5 as it creates a long slender member_6 causing overstress. Instead, extend node_4 slightly higher to act as main upper node. Connect node_3 to node_4 and create diagonal supports to nodes 1 and 2 forming a truss arch, reducing tensile/compressive load. Use moderate areas to balance stress and mass.",
  
  "proposal": "Remove node_5, move node_4 to (2.9, 4.5) to create a stronger arch. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, and node_3-node_4 as diagonal. Set areas to 2 or 3 based on member length and estimated stress. Eliminate member_6,7,8,9 to reduce length-based stress concentrations.",
  
  "reasoning": "Simplified truss with fewer nodes and members, shorter members reduce stress. Arch shape efficiently carries vertical loads. Use medium-sized member areas (area=2 or area=3) to keep stress ≤20 and mass ≤30. Avoid fragile, slender, unstabilized members that cause overstress.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: node_1-node_3:2.0, node_3-node_2:4.0, node_1-node_4:sqrt(2.9^2+4.5^2)=5.35, node_2-node_4=sqrt((6-2.9)^2+4.5^2)=4.58, node_3-node_4=sqrt((2.9-2)^2+4.5^2)=4.52. Assign area 2 to shorter members, area 3 to longer. Calculate approximate mass = sum(length*area factor). max length * max area = 5.35*3.128=16.7 mass component, overall about 13-15 total mass <30 threshold. Stress expected reduced by load path optimization.",
  
  "calculation": "Mass = 2.0*0.782 + 4.0*0.782 + 5.35*3.128 + 4.58*3.128 + 4.52*3.128\n=1.564 + 3.128 + 16.73 + 14.32 + 14.14\n=~49.9 mass too high if using area 4 (3.128) for all long members. Adjust:\nUse area 1 (0.195) for node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4:\nMass new = 1.564 + 3.128 + 5.35*0.195 + 4.58*0.195 + 4.52*0.782\n= 4.692 + 1.04 + 0.89 + 3.53 ≈ 10.15 mass < 30\nStress estimated reduce with diagonals and lower cross sections.",
