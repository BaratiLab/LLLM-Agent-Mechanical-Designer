Truss must be closed and connected.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Given colinear nodes node_1, node_3, node_2 on x-axis, to form a closed truss, need to add at least one more node off this line connecting these nodes. Load is downward-left diagonal at node_3, so adding a node above line near node_3 will help transfer load efficiently through triangular members. Aim is to form two triangles sharing node_3 and that extra node, ensuring statical determinacy and load transfer paths. Members will connect nodes to form closed loop without redundant members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 near (2.5, 3.0) above node_3 to create a triangular configuration (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4). Check member lengths and assign areas from catalog with low areas to reduce mass but enough to stay under stress limits. Approximate member forces using static equilibrium in simplified 2D truss conditions. Use method of joints at node_3 to estimate forces. Adjust areas accordingly.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Node_4 position chosen to optimize triangle height for reasonable member lengths (~3 units).

Using load components Fx and Fy from load magnitude 10 at -45°: Fx = -10cos45= -7.07N, Fy= -7.07N. Major tensile and compressive forces expected in diagonal members connecting to node_4. Areas selected from catalog to satisfy stress = Force / (Area * allowable stress). Assume linear elastic behavior. Assume uniform member cross section and axial force only. Mass computed as sum(length * area) for all members. Target max area to keep mass ≤30. Adjust areas for critical members accordingly.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths using distance formula. Calculate internal member forces using static equilibrium at node_3 and node_4.

Load at node_3 Fx = -7.07N, Fy = -7.07N. Approximate forces assuming node_3 equilibrium: Tensile in node_3-node_4 ~10N along member, compressive in node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2 sharing load.
