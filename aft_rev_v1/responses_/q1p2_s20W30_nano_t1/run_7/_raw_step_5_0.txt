Load is at node_3 down-left; supports at nodes 1(pinned), 2(roller) at base. Need to reduce stress in member_3 and redistribute forces by structural redesign.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current design has high tensile stress in member_3 [\'node_1\'-\'node_4\'] with area 1 (0.195), likely too small area or excessive length causing stress. Members adjacent to load node_3 mostly have small areas causing stress concentration. Lack of vertical members or additional bracing to better distribute load. Member_5 [\'node_3\'-\'node_4\'] with area 3 (1.759) is heavily loaded but stress there is moderate and compressive. Seems top node_4 is too high and unstable.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress on member_3, increase cross-section or add/stiffen members providing alternate load path. Potentially add a new node above or between node_3 and node_4 for better force distribution. Maintain supports at nodes 1 and 2. Avoid large areas increasing mass too much. Consider triangular bracing shapes for stiffness.",\n\n    "proposal": "Add a new intermediate node close to node_4 but lower y coordinate; create members from node_1 and node_2 to new node and from node_3 to new node to form better triangular braces. Increase area of critical tension member. Reduce height of node_4 to decrease tensile demand on member_3. Final structure with 5 nodes: node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed; node_4 lowered; node_5 new at around (2.8, 3.7). Use area selection to keep mass under 30 and stresses ≤ 20.",\n\n    "reasoning": "By lowering node_4 and adding node_5 with bracing members, the load at node_3 will be transferred more efficiently into supports via additional paths, reducing tensile stress on member_3. Increased member areas are assigned selectively on members carrying higher tension/compression while keeping overall mass low. Triangulated members provide stiffness and reduce bending, thus reducing stress.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths of members, estimate forces and stresses using statics and area selections. Verify max stress ≤ ±20. Adjust areas accordingly. Approximate mass by sum(length × area) and keep under 30. No duplicate nodes or members. Supports fixed at node_1 and node_2.",\n\n    "calculation": "Nodes: node_1(0.0,0.0), node_2(6.0,0.0), node_3(2.0,0.0), node_4(2.9,3.7), node_5(3.8,3.7).
