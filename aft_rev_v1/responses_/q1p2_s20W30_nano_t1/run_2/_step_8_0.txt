  "preamble": "Optimized 2D truss at iteration 7 meets constraints with low max stress and acceptable mass.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective is minimizing stress, currently max stress is 8.7 well below ±20, mass 22.8 below 30. Node_1 and node_2 fixed supports, node_3 load fixed. Areas chosen mostly 2 and 3. Design is stable and closed. Constraints are met.",
  
  "analysis": "Stress is low, well under limits. Mass is reasonable. Current design has a good stress distribution, with no member near constraints. Minor adjustments to node_5 could reduce stress slightly but tradeoff with complexity and marginal gains. Structure is statically stable and closed.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further minor node moves may reduce stress marginally but sacrifices are minimal. Mass limit is acceptable. No violations in stress or mass.",
  
  "reasoning": "With max stress 8.7 and mass 22.8, design is efficient. Members carry balanced load with no extreme stress concentrations. Load node_3 and fixed supports node_1, node_2 must remain fixed, so limited repositioning possible. Changes in node_5 position have little effect now. Area assignments balance capacity and mass. Further improvements likely minimal.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Max stress ±20 allowed vs 8.7 actual, mass ≤30 vs 22.8 actual, node positions can only move except load/support nodes, no duplicates, areas from given set used correctly.",
  
  "calculation": "Reviewing member stresses and masses, redistributed areas already minimized. Node_5 at (2.5,2.4) is near optimal to maintain low stresses in members 3,4,5,6,7. Any slight reposition risks increasing stress or mass. Total mass well under max limit 30.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Current structure meets all design constraints and minimizes stress well. No design changes warranted for iteration 8 as improvements will be marginal. Recommend stopping optimization.",
