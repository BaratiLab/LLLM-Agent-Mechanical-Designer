Supports fixed at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Constraints are max stress ±20 and mass <= 30. Current design max stress 30.6 (exceeds 20) on member_3 and mass 15.27 (acceptable). Existing structure is fairly minimal with 4 nodes, 5 members. Prior iterations suggest adding/removing nodes and adjusting areas to reduce stress concentration on members connecting load node to support nodes.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current max stress exceeds tensile/compressive limit on member_3 (\'node_1\'-\'node_4\'). Mass is within limit. Using large cross-sectional area members (area_id 3) on bottom chord members, but top chord members have small areas leading to localized stress peak. The problem involves stress concentration near load node_3 and apex node_4. The solution is to redistribute forces by adding a new node between node_3 and node_4, providing better load path and reducing member length and stress in critical members. Also increase cross-section areas where stress is high. With controlled node placement, maintain geometry symmetry and reduce length of heavily stressed members.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_5 near (2.5, 2.5) between node_3 and node_4. Connect node_5 to node_1, node_2, node_3, and node_4 to create multiple load paths. Use cross-section areas in range 2 to 4 to control mass and stress. Remove direct \'node_1\'-\'node_4\' member to reduce stress concentration there and rely on the new node to redistribute load. Bottom chord members use area 3. Top and diagonal members area 2 or 3 depending on length and stress estimation.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (2.5, 2.4). Members: [\'node_1\'-\'node_3\'(3)], [\'node_3\'-\'node_2\'(3)], [\'node_1\'-\'node_5\'(2)], [\'node_5\'-\'node_2\'(2)], [\'node_3\'-\'node_5\'(3)], [\'node_5\'-\'node_4\'(2)], [\'node_2\'-\'node_4\'(1)]. Remove \'node_1\'-\'node_4\' member to avoid stress spike there. Areas chosen to balance mass and stress. This keeps structure statically stable, optimal force distribution, and reduces max stress below 20.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Introducing node_5 between node_3 and node_4 breaks the long diagonal stressed member into shorter segments reducing axial forces. Removing direct heavy loaded member \'node_1\'-\'node_4\' reduces tensile stress over 20 observed previously. Assigning cross-sectional areas based on length and stress helps reduce mass and keeps stresses under limit. Support nodes and load node positions unchanged per instructions. Structure is a stable triangulated truss with multiple load paths and symmetrically placed nodes.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and axial forces assuming linear elasticity and typical load path.
