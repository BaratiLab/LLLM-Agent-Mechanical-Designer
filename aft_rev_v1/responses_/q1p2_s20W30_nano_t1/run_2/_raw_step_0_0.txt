Node positions fixed except for adding nodes if needed.",\n\n    "analysis": "With 3 nodes on a line (0,0), (2,0), (6,0), forming a valid closed truss requires at least a triangle or adding extra nodes to avoid colinearity. To achieve close truss and minimize stress, add a top node above these to form a triangle, reducing stress concentration. Support at node_1 pinned (2 reactions), node_2 roller (1 reaction). Load applied at node_3 (-10, -45°) means diagonal downward force. Use triangle: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_4 (3,h) with h to be optimized. Connect node_3 to node_4 internally or redefine node_3 position to connect in triangle. But node_3 position fixed (2,0), so form quadrilateral or triangle with node_4 on top. Connect all nodes to form closed truss with no duplicates.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding node_4 at midpoint x=3 with y>0 to create ideal triangle; connections: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_2 (to close polygon). Now, calculate stress and choose area. Use static equilibrium assumptions and approximate forces on members.

Add node_4 (3,y) where y>0 to form triangle with nodes node_1, node_2, node_4 enclosing node_3 forming a pyramid-like truss. Members connected to transfer load effectively reducing stress on any single member. Assume linear elastic and axial forces only. Calculate lengths.
