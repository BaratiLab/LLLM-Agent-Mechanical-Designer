Mass 11.45 < 30. Need to reduce stress in critical members by topology and area changes.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has a high compressive stress in member_2 (node_1-node_3). Triangular bracing with node_4 helps but is not enough. Member_2 area is smallest (0.195) but still too stressed. Member_4 and member_5 length and area are large, adding mass but low stress. Load is diagonal (-10, -45 deg) at node_3 on axis x=2, making horizontal bottom chord stressed excessively in compression. Supports at nodes_1(pinned) and 2(roller) define boundary conditions.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max compressive stress in member_2, need to reduce compression or redistribute load. Possible by adding vertical or near vertical intermediate nodes to reduce unbraced length. Also, increase cross-sectional area on critical members but mindful of mass. Reconsider member layout to form more stable triangles and load paths.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add an additional intermediate node above node_3 to form a two-story truss. Remove member_2 (bottom chord node_1-node_3) to reduce direct compression, replace with 2 shorter compression members from node_1 and node_2 converging on new node. Adjust areas for better stress. Resulting truss forms two interconnected triangles distributing load efficiently.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 above node_3 creates a more favorable load path. The load at node_3 is supported with shorter members, reducing compressive forces. Removing the highest stressed member_2 avoids overstress. Increasing areas slightly on diagonals carrying load to supports allows stress reduction without large mass increase. Bottom chord replaced with longer members with increased area to maintain stability. Constraints checked by estimated member lengths and areas from catalog.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Addition of node_5 at approx (2.0, 1.8). New members: node_1-node_5, node_2-node_5, node_3-node_5. Remove member_2. Areas chosen: 2 (0.782) or 3 (1.759) for diagonals, 1 (0.195) for bottom chord, balancing mass and stress. Lengths calculated approx: node_1-node_5 ~2.4, node_2-node_5 ~4.1, node_3-node_5 ~1.8. Mass sum estimated <30.
