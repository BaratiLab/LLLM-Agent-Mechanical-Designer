  "preamble": "Optimizing the 2D truss to satisfy stress and mass constraints under given loads and supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: max stress ≤ ±20, total mass ≤ 30. Current design violates stress (max 31.2 > 20) though mass is acceptable (27.6 < 30). Load at node_3 (-10 N at -45°). Supports fixed at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller).",
  
  "analysis": "Current design stresses exceed allowable limits, particularly member_3 (node_1 to node_4) at 31.2 tension. Members with large areas concentrated on nodes connecting supports and load, causing localized stress peaks. The high stress in member_3 indicates need to redistribute load and improve stiffness. The structure uses 4 nodes with asymmetric node_4 placement. The absence of intermediate nodes may limit stress distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding a node between node_3 and the load path or altering node_4 position to balance forces. Adjust member areas to reduce stress. Use larger areas on highly stressed members and smaller areas elsewhere to keep mass low. Ensure no member over 20 stress. Utilize triangles for stiffness and minimize long members under high load.",
  
  "proposal": "Add one node (node_5) near midpoint between node_3 and node_4 to improve geometrical stiffness and create additional load paths. Slightly reposition node_4 higher for better force distribution. Design members to form multiple triangular substructures to share load. Adjust member areas: larger areas (4 or 5) for highly stressed members; small areas (1 or 2) for less stressed members to reduce mass.",
  
  "reasoning": "1) Adding node_5 near (2.3, 2.0) to subdivide forces and reduce member_3 stress. 2) Move node_4 from (2.7,3.3) to (2.8,3.6) to increase vertical reach and stiffness, reducing tensile demand on member_3. 3) Connect node_5 to node_3, node_4, and node_2 forming triangles to effectively transfer forces. 4) Assign area '4' (3.128) to primary tension/compression members to lower stress. 5) Assign area '2' (0.782) to secondary members to keep mass low. 6) Keep members between supports at moderate area to optimize mass vs. stiffness.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Length calculations: node_1 to node_3 ≈ 2.0, node_3 to node_2 ≈ 4.0, node_1 to node_4 ≈ 4.36, node_2 to node_4 ≈ 4.1, node_3 to node_4 ≈ 1.79, node_3 to node_5 ~1.0, node_5 to node_4 ~1.6, node_5 to node_2 ~2.3. Use these lengths with areas to estimate mass and evaluate expected stresses. Mass estimate: Sum(length × area) < 30. Stress expected to be distributed among members sharing load triangles.",
  
  "calculation": "Members and lengths: m1: (node_1-node_3, 2.0, area 4) mass=6.256; m2: (node_3-node_2, 4.0, area 4) mass=12.512; m3: (node_1-node_4, 4.36, area 2) mass~3.4; m4: (node_2-node_4,4.1, area 2) mass~3.2; m5: (node_3-node_4,1.79, area 3) mass~1.76; m6: (node_3-node_5,1.0, area 2) mass=0.78; m7: (node_5-node_4,1.6, area 2) mass=1.25; m8: (node_5-node_2,2.3, area 1) mass=0.45; total mass estimated ~30, slightly under constraint. Stress distribution expected to be reduced especially on original critical member_3 due to node_5.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All members form efficient triangular systems distributing forces. Areas chosen to keep mass within 30 while reducing max stress below 20. Node_5 helps reduce high tension in member_3. Supports unchanged. No duplicate nodes or connections.",
