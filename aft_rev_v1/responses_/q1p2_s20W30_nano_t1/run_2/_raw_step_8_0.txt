Mass is reasonable. Current design has a good stress distribution, with no member near constraints. Minor adjustments to node_5 could reduce stress slightly but tradeoff with complexity and marginal gains. Structure is statically stable and closed.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further minor node moves may reduce stress marginally but sacrifices are minimal. Mass limit is acceptable. No violations in stress or mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "With max stress 8.7 and mass 22.8, design is efficient. Members carry balanced load with no extreme stress concentrations. Load node_3 and fixed supports node_1, node_2 must remain fixed, so limited repositioning possible. Changes in node_5 position have little effect now. Area assignments balance capacity and mass.
