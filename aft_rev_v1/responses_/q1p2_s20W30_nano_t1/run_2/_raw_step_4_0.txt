Current max stress 30.34 exceeds limit. Mass 19.77 is acceptable. Load at node_3 at -45° angle. Supports fixed at nodes 1 and 2. Nodes 3 and 4 fixed positions. Node 5 adjustable.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current structure failed stress constraint mainly at member_2 (node_1-node_3) under tension. Large stress due to load path concentration. Member areas mostly low, causing overstress. Structure has redundant members but some underutilized. Load at intermediate node_3 on base causes bending effect. To reduce stress, need better load distribution and stiffer load path, possibly by repositioning intermediate nodes or adding members connecting loaded node and supports, while keeping mass controlled.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Approach: keep load and support nodes fixed, modify intermediate nodes. Possibly remove node_5 and reposition node_4 to form truss with more triangulation and shorter high-stress members. Use higher area for critical members under tension/compression, and smaller areas for stable diagonals. Avoid very large members on base span to reduce mass. Consider moving node_4 slightly more centered above node_3 to offload direct tension on member_2.",\n\n  "proposal": "Remove node_5 to simplify topology. Adjust node_4 to (2.7, 3.3) to raise apex closer to load node_3 and support balance. Use members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_2 (bottom chord). Assign areas to keep stress ≤20 and mass ≤30 by increasing area moderately on tension members and reducing others.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Raising node_4 and removing node_5 reduces complexity and stress concentrations. Adding node_1-node_2 bottom chord member with small area improves base stability. Larger areas assigned to members aligned with load path to distribute forces. Shortening longest members reduces mass. Conservative area selection ensures max stress within limits. This triangulated design efficiently carries load from node_3 to supports without overstressing.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_2:6.0, node_1-node_3:2.0, node_3-node_2:4.0, node_1-node_4:√(2.7²+3.3²)=4.27, node_2-node_4:√((6-2.7)²+3.3²)=4.01, node_3-node_4:√((2.7-2.0)²+(3.3-0)²)=3.43.
