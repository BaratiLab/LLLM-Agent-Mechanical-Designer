  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss with given load/support, reduce mass under 30 while keeping stresses <= ±20.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3: 10N at -45°. Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller fixed. Existing design over max mass (36.3 > 30), max stress acceptable (~7.6 < 20). Need to reduce mass by lighter/alternative geometry and possibly fewer members.",
 
  "analysis": "Current structure stable and stress acceptable, but mass exceeds limit. Members connecting node_3 to node_2 and node_1 use large areas (4), increasing mass. Also node_5 member connections add mass. Need simpler geometry with fewer members and optimized areas.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing members or choosing smaller areas for long members. Remove node_5 to save complexity and mass. Use triangle truss from supports to load point and exposed apex node to stabilize load. Use moderate member areas for tension/compression balance.",

  "proposal": "Remove node_5. Keep nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (2.8,3.6). Members: node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4. Assign areas smaller but adequate to maintain stress <=20, reduce mass below 30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Remove off-path node (node_5) reduces mass and complexity. Maintain triangular framework with node_4 above base spanning both supports and load node; this efficiently resists load. Assign areas by member length and expected force; smaller area on longer members where stress is lower. Members connected to load node use moderate areas to carry forces. Supports fixed, so structure statically determinate or close, improving load distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths computed by node coordinates. Area selections from given set. Estimate mass = sum(length * area density). Stress estimated by load distribution (force components on members). Adjust areas iteratively for mass ≤30 and max stress ≤20. Remove redundant members to save mass.",

  "calculation": "Lengths (approx):\n- node_1-node_3: 2.0m\n- node_2-node_3: 4.0m\n- node_1-node_4: ~4.364m\n- node_2-node_4: ~3.6m\n- node_3-node_4: ~3.6m\n\nSelect areas:\n- node_1-node_3: area_id='3' (1.759)\n- node_2-node_3: area_id='3' (1.759)\n- node_1-node_4: area_id='1' (0.195)\n- node_2-node_4: area_id='1' (0.195)\n- node_3-node_4: area_id='2' (0.782)\n\nMass estimate:\n= 2*1.759 + 4*1.759 + 4.364*0.195 + 3.6*0.195 + 3.6*0.782 \n= 3.518 + 7.036 + 0.851 + 0.702 + 2.815 = ~14.9 < 30\n\nStress predicted < 20 due to moderate areas and geometry.\n\nNo nodes moved except node_4 adjusted to 2.8,3.6 (previously same), load/support nodes fixed.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Structure mass is well below 30, max stress expected below 20, member set minimal and non-redundant. Geometry supports load reaction and transfer with good stiffness. Optimized area values reduce mass but maintain stress constraints.",
