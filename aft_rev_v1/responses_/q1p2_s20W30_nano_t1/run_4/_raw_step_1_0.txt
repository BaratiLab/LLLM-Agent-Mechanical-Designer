Total mass 10.07 << 30. Load at node_3 down-left, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_3 free to move along x-axis, node_4 free to move in plane. Member_4 has max stress (17.09).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current max stress is on member_4 between node_4 (2,4) and node_2 (6,0). Member_4\'s area is small (area_id=1, area=0.195). Increase cross-sectional area there or adjust node_4 position to reduce stress. Moving node_4 slightly may reduce tensile force in member_4. Other members have moderate stress and acceptable areas. Total mass allows some area increase in critical members. Closed truss shape already present. Node_3 constrained on x-axis for load application.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increase member_4 area from 0.195 to maybe 0.782 or 1.759 will reduce stress. Adjust node_4 leftwards and somewhat down to reduce tensile elongation on member_4 and balance forces in members 3,4,5. Check member lengths and recalculated masses and stresses. Try node_4 at (1.4,3.2) as trial for reduced tensile in member_4 and force redistribution. Keep load/support nodes fixed.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "By moving node_4 closer to node_3 and lowering it, member_4 length reduces and force components change, likely lowering max tensile stress. Increasing area of member_4 from 0.195 (area_id \'1\') to 0.782 (area_id \'2\') or 1.759 (area_id \'3\') reduces stress proportionally. Keep member_5 area at \'2\' to sustain shear. Member_2 area at \'1\' is small but stress moderate, keep it or increase slightly if needed. Members 1 and 3 kept as is or slight adjustment if needed.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculation needed: member_4 length = dist between node_4 and node_2. New length ~ sqrt((6-1.4)^2 + (0 - 3.2)^2) = sqrt(4.6^2 + 3.2^2) = sqrt(21.16 + 10.24) = sqrt(31.4) ≈ 5.6. Previous length: sqrt((6-2)^2 + 0-4^2) = sqrt(16+16) = 5.66, slight length reduction. Smaller length helps reduce stress for fixed force. With bigger area, member_4 stress approx reduces by factor of old_area/new_area. Mass recalculated by length × area. Total mass remains well below limit.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Assign node_4 to (1.4,3.2). member_4 area_id to \'2\' (area 0.782). member_5 area remains at \'2\'. member_3 area remains \'2\'. member_1 area \'2\' unchanged. member_2 area \'1\' unchanged. Estimated max stress reduced below 15 due to increased area and slight geometry improvement. Estimated total mass ~ 12 (increase due to member_4 area increase and slightly bigger member_5 area).
