  "preamble": "Current structure satisfies constraints with low max stress and acceptable mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: minimize stress while respecting max stress ±20 and max mass ≤ 30. Current max stress ~6.8, total mass ~18.3. Allowed to move only node_4 (free node).",
  "analysis": "Max stress is well below allowable limits, indicating good stress distribution. Total mass is also well below max limit. Node_4 repositioned from previous iterations to adjust stresses effectively. Member area sizes chosen to balance mass and strength. No redundant members, and all constraints respected.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress significantly reduced compared to previous iterations (max stress down from ~17 to ~6.8); mass increased but still under limit. Further improvements likely marginal given diminishing returns and constraints.",
  "reasoning": "Keeping node_1 and node_2 fixed due to supports, and node_3 fixed due to applied load, only node_4 can be optimized. Node_4 is currently at (1.45, 2.8), which helps balance stresses and maintain lightweight design. Member areas chosen (area ids: 3,2,2,2,3) providing higher strength in highly stressed members while maintaining mass balance. Stress margin is good, further repositioning would likely increase mass or not significantly reduce stress.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: \nmember_1 (node_1-node_3): 2.0m, area 3 (1.759), \nmass approx = length * area (weighted) * density factor (assumed uniform),\nCurrent mass approx total 18.3 < 30.\nMaximum stresses < 7 < 20 allowed.\nLoad at node_3 downward left at 45°, supports fixed.\nFurther elevating or repositioning node_4 may cause stress increases or mass jumps.",
  "calculation": "No changes in node locations for load/support nodes; only node_4 free to move. Previously tested positions adjusted node_4 y within 2.6-3.2 range. Current is 2.8, near optimal found by iteration. Member area assignments settled to optimize stress and mass tradeoff.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Constraints met, max stress safely below limits, mass below max, no duplicate members or nodes. Allowed movements respected. Optimal design achieved at this iteration.",
