Mass usage moderate (12). Node_4 moved down and left in last step to 1.4,3.2 from 2,4.0. Member_2 area currently small (area_id=1: 0.195) leading to high stress.

Slightly moving node_4 to redistribute forces and shorten high-stress member lengths is key. Avoid increasing total mass >30. Consider increasing member_2 area from 1 to 2 or 3 to reduce stress. Possibly adjust node_4 coordinates slightly towards node_2 to reduce length and stress in member_2 and member_4.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Member_2 carries max stress in compression (-17.38). Its length is |node_3-node_2| = 4 units (distance 6-2=4 on x-axis). Area currently 0.195 (area_id=1). Increasing area reduces stress proportionally. Increase area from 1 to 3 (0.782 to 1.759) should reduce stress around by factor ~2x (stress approx inversely proportional to area). Mass increase acceptable. Node_4 can be moved slightly closer to node_2 horizontally to reduce forces in members 4 and 5 and further reduce stress.
