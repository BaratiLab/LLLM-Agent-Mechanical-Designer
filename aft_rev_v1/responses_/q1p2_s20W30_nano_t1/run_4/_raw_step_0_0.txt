Load at node_3: -10N at -45°. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Max stress ±20, max mass 30. Closed truss means all nodes connected with no isolated nodes. Aim to add members and possibly one node to form a stable triangular/closed shape.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Original nodes lie on x-axis, collinear, which offers zero flexural stiffness and high stress risk under vertical loads. Closed truss requires adding at least one node above x-axis to form a triangle. This distributes loads, reduces member stress. Adding node above node_3 at (2.0, y) with y>0 forms a triangle: \'node_4\'. Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2 to form closed shape. Check members and assign areas from available list. Approximate stresses by method of joints and member forces, assume axial forces only. Calculate lengths for mass, areas for stress limits. Use smaller areas in compression where forces are lower to save mass.", \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Triangle formation will reduce bending. Node_4 vertically above node_3 at y ~4.0 as an initial guess. Calculate member lengths, forces assuming static equilibrium. Consider force due to load at node_3 resolved into x and y components: Fx = -10*cos(45°) = -7.07N, Fy = -10*sin(45°) = -7.07N (down-right quadrant assumed). Supports reactions found by equilibrium. Choose member areas to keep max stress ≤ 20, minimize mass.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Original 3 nodes collinear cannot form stable truss under out-of-plane load. Adding node_4 (2.0, 4.0) enables triangular geometry. Members connect nodes to form closed shape: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4. This will distribute forces and ensure stability. Areas assigned from input list balancing mass and stress. Assume axial forces only; no bending. Calculate member forces using method of joints based on equilibrium. Estimate max tensile/compressive force and relate to stress by σ = F/(A*1). Stress limit ±20 => Area ≥ |F|/20. Sum mass = ∑(length * area). Keep total mass ≤ 30.", \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: l13 = 2.0, l32 = 4.0, l14 ~4.47, l42 ~4.47, l34 = 4.0. Rough force distribution: tension in chord members node_1-node_4 and node_4-node_2, compression in node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2, diagonal node_3-node_4 in tension or compression based on load.
