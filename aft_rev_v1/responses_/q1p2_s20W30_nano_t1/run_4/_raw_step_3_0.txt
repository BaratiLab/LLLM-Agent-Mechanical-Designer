Current max stress ~12.6, mass ~17.1. Load at node_3; supports fixed at nodes 1,2. Node_4 movable to optimize stress distribution. Members mostly area_id 2 and 3; member_2 area increased to 3 increased mass significantly.",\n\n  "analysis": "Stress successfully reduced from prior ~17 to ~12.6 by increasing area of member_2 from 1 to 3; however, mass rose from ~12 to ~17, but still below 30. Node_4 moved down from (1.4,3.2) to (1.55,2.6) reducing max stress. The largest compressive stress is member_1 (-12.6), tensile higher in member_3 (~7.0). The biggest mass contribution is member_2 (7.036), long length and large area. To reduce max stress, load path and member stiffness distribution is critical. Node_4 position affects triangulation and force flow.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "If we slightly adjust node_4 vertically and horizontally, we may reduce member_1 stress, possibly move node_4 slightly closer to node_3 and closer to node_1 horizontally to better align truss members and reduce bending. Consider decreasing area of member_2 if stress allows. Member_5 area of 2 can be increased to reduce its compression stress (about -9.17), or member_1 area can be slightly increased. Ensure no member approach ±20 stress. Mass budget gives leverage to increase area on critical members and reduce length by adjusting node_4.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Adjust node_4 coordinates with small increments to balance stress. Increase area on high stress compressive member_1 from 2 to 3 (area 0.782 to 1.759) to reduce stress. Reduce area of member_2 from 3 to 2 (from 1.759 to 0.782 area) given its low stress (-2.29), to reduce mass. Member_5 currently area 2, could be increased to 3 if needed. Member_3 and member_4 areas mostly similar; balance internal forces by adjusting node_4. By moving node_4 slightly towards (1.4, 2.8), triangulation stiffens, stress should become more uniform and reduce max compressive stress.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Area dictionary: \'0\':1, \'1\':0.195, \'2\':0.782, \'3\':1.759. Current areas mostly 2 or 3. Mass = sum(length*area). Areas selection impacts stress via cross-sectional area effect. Length calculations between nodes needed to estimate mass. Constraints: |stress| ≤20, mass ≤30. Current mass 17.06, room to increase areas on critical members. Target reduce max compressive stress from -12.63 towards ±10 range for safety margin.",\n\n  "calculation": "Adjust node_4 from (1.55, 2.6) to (1.45, 2.8). Change member areas: member_1 area 3 (1.759), member_2 area 2 (0.782), member_3 area 2 (0.782), member_4 area 2 (0.782), member_5 area 3 (1.759). This reduces area of heavy member_2 to save mass, increases area of member_1 to reduce max compressive stress, increases member_5 area to reduce compressive stress. Estimated net mass ~15-17 (less than current 17.06). Expected max stress reduced below 12 by increasing member_1 area and improving geometry. Node_3, node_1, node_2 fixed for load/support, node_4 moved within constraint.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes/members. Node_4 position new (1.45, 2.8) distinct from others.
