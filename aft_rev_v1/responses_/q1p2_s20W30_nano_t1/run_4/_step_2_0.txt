  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 17.4 < 20 limit, mass 12 < 30 limit. Load and supports fixed. Goal: Reduce max stress further by modifying node_4 position and member areas.",
  
  "analysis": "Max tensile stress remains at member_2 (-17.38), close to 20. Mass usage moderate (12). Node_4 moved down and left in last step to 1.4,3.2 from 2,4.0. Member_2 area currently small (area_id=1: 0.195) leading to high stress. Members connected to node_4 have area_id=2 (0.782). Node_3 position fixed at 2,0 due to load.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing area of highly stressed member_2 reduces stress. Slightly moving node_4 to redistribute forces and shorten high-stress member lengths is key. Avoid increasing total mass >30. Consider increasing member_2 area from 1 to 2 or 3 to reduce stress. Possibly adjust node_4 coordinates slightly towards node_2 to reduce length and stress in member_2 and member_4.",

  "reasoning": "Member_2 carries max stress in compression (-17.38). Its length is |node_3-node_2| = 4 units (distance 6-2=4 on x-axis). Area currently 0.195 (area_id=1). Increasing area reduces stress proportionally. Increase area from 1 to 3 (0.782 to 1.759) should reduce stress around by factor ~2x (stress approx inversely proportional to area). Mass increase acceptable. Node_4 can be moved slightly closer to node_2 horizontally to reduce forces in members 4 and 5 and further reduce stress. Node_4 y-position can be lowered slightly below 3.2 to reduce lever arm and moments. Node_1 and node_2 fixed positions due to supports/load. No duplicate nodes or members.",
