  "preamble": "Optimizing 2D truss to minimize max stress under load within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress ~13.66 < 20 allowed, mass 13.73 < 30 max. Load applied at node_3. Supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. Node_4 moved closer to reduce mass and stress but max stress increased slightly. Areas consistent with 0.782 (area_id '2').",
  
  "analysis": "Max compressive stress on member_1 is highest (~-13.66). Member_1 length is 2.0 (node_1 to node_3). Members connected to node_4 also bear moderate stress. Node_4 moved downward and left from prior iterations reduced overall mass but increased stress slightly. Current configuration is stable and satisfies constraints. Further stress reduction possible by adjusting the position of node_4 slightly upward and right to better balance forces, increasing stiffness of member_1 and hence reducing max compressive stress. Area selection remains area_id '2' consistent to keep mass low.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Since load is at node_3 pulling diagonally down-left, member_1 under compression with max stress. Moving node_4 to optimize force paths may reduce stress on member_1. Increasing height and lateral shift of node_4 may be beneficial. Avoid increasing member lengths too much to keep mass low.",
  
  "reasoning": "Max stress is compressive on member_1. Shortening member_1 or aligning node_4 to reduce force on member_1 is key. Area '2' balances mass and capacity. Moving node_4 slightly to (2.4, 3.15) will increase bracing effect from node_4 to node_3 and node_4 to node_2, potentially reducing stress on member_1 and redistributing load. Slight increase in height also improves truss leverage. Member connections are effective and closed. No node movement allowed for load/support nodes, so only node_4 adjusted.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "member_1 length = distance(node_1-node_3) = 2.0 still fixed because nodes fixed. node_4 position adjusted to optimize force flow. Areas remain as '2' with area = 0.782. Recalculating member lengths for mass estimation after moving node_4:\n\nOld node_4: (2.3,3.0)\nNew node_4: (2.4,3.15)\nlength(node_1-node_4)=sqrt((2.4)^2+(3.15)^2)=~3.92\nlength(node_4-node_2)=sqrt((6.0-2.4)^2+(0-3.15)^2)=~4.25\nlength(node_4-node_3)=sqrt((2.4-2.0)^2+(3.15-0.0)^2)=~3.16\nTotal length change minimal, negligible increase in mass.\n\nEstimate mass = sum(length*area), area=0.782\nOld mass estimate roughly 13.7, expect slight increase < 0.2\n\nStress expected to reduce max compressive stress as node_4 shift improves force distribution.",
  
  "calculation": "Adjusted node_4 position to (2.4,3.15). Areas unchanged, members unchanged in connectivity and area id. Expect minor mass increase to about 13.9, max stress slightly reduced, potentially ~13.0 or less. This iteration aims to reduce max stress while maintaining low mass and preserving constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Check node positions: node_1 and node_2 (supports and loads) unchanged. node_3 unchanged (load). node_4 moved slightly up-right and higher.\nCheck members unchanged, areas consistent.\nMass under 30, stress under 20. Closed truss structure preserved.",
