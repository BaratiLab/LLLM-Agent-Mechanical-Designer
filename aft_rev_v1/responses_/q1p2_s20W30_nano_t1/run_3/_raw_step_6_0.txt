Only movable node is node_4 (load and supports fixed). Stress concentrated mostly in member_1 (-13.8). Objective: reduce max stress magnitude and balance member loads.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_1 is critical with max compressive stress -13.8. To reduce stress, moving node_4 slightly to better distribute load and decrease demand on member_1. Previous data show node_4 near (2.3-2.5, 2.9-3.15). Increasing vertical component can increase moment arm to reduce stress in member_1, but mass is sensitive to member length. Proposed to raise node_4 slightly and shift horizontally near node_3 to balance forces.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Raising node_4 to near (2.5,3.3) previously gave stress ~13.6 but mass slightly higher. Trying intermediate between (2.45, 3.1) and (2.5, 3.3) to balance stress and mass. Areas remain area_id \'2\' for all members as stresses well below limits and to keep mass low.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_3 fixed at (2,0). Node_4 relocated around (2.47,3.2) to try to reduce member_1 stress by changing force path. Members with compressive stress near limit considered for stress reduction. Balance between member length (affects mass) and force magnitude. No area changes due to adequate performance and area \'2\' mass is moderate. Closed structure maintained by current connectivity.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths with new node_4, estimate stress effect qualitatively. Member_1 length slightly increased -> area constant -> stress probably reduced due to load path. Members 3,4,5 adjusted by node_4 move. Stress expected to decrease slightly for member_1, other members small changes.",\n  \n  "calculation": "New node_4 at (2.47, 3.2). Member_1 length: sqrt((2 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2) = 2.0 unchanged horizontal, node_4 move affects load transfer, not length of member_1. Member_3 length: ~sqrt((2.47 -0)^2 + (3.2 - 0)^2) ≈ 3.96 (vs previous ~3.9), slight length increase, similar area. Member_5 length: ~sqrt((2.47 - 2)^2 + (3.2 - 0)^2) ≈ 3.24 (vs ~3.1 previously). These adjustments expected to slightly reduce peak stress. Mass sum estimated similar around 13.9. Stress predicted less than previous max 13.8. Constraints should hold.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Review constraints: max stress < 20 (OK), mass < 30 (OK), node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed, design closed with 5 members. Area consistent.
