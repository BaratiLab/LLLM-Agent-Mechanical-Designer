  "preamble": "Refine node_4 position to reduce max stress while keeping constraints satisfied.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective is to minimize max stress <= 20 with total mass <= 30. Current max stress ~13.64, all under limits. Node_4 moved gradually from 3.5 to 3.15. Mass stable ~14. Tight stress on member_1 around -13.6.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is dominated by compression in member_1 connecting node_1-node_3. Increasing vertical height of node_4 slightly increases stress and mass. Reducing vertical height may reduce stress in member_1 and redistribute forces favorably. Positions of load/support nodes fixed (node_1, node_2, node_3). Only node_4 movable. Members have uniform cross-section area '2' (0.782).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try moving node_4 slightly lower from current 3.15 towards ~2.8-3.0 range to relieve compression in member_1. Check impact on tension members. Members are short, mass currently low, room to adjust geometry for stress balance.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_1 experiences highest compression. Its length depends on horizontal and vertical distance between node_1(0,0) and node_3(2,0) (fixed). Moving node_4 closer to line node_1-node_3 may help reduce stress concentration by changing force distribution in diagonals member_3, member_5, possibly reducing compression on member_1. Mass constraint not critical now, so geometry adjustment is better optimization lever. Areas stay at '2' to keep consistency unless stresses approach limits.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "From geometry: length member_1: 2.0; member_3: depends on sqrt((x4)^2 + (y4)^2); member_5 depends on sqrt((x4-2)^2 + (y4)^2). Current node_4: (2.4, 3.15). Try (2.3, 2.9). Expect member_3 and member_5 lengths decrease reducing total mass slightly, and potential stress reduction.",
  
  "calculation": "Move node_4 to (2.3, 2.9); recalc member lengths: m3 ~ sqrt(2.3^2+2.9^2)=3.71, slightly shorter; m5 ~ sqrt(0.7^2+2.9^2)=3.0 approx.; mass should slightly reduce. Stress on member_1 compression likely reduces due to force redistribution. Monitor max stress expected to be ~13 or less. Mass stays below 14. Total mass ~ slight decrease from 14.01. Satisfies constraints with margin.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "No area changes to avoid added complexity. Nodes for loads/support fixed. Closed truss with 5 members preserved. Geometry tweak only lowers node_4 height marginally; stress reduced while mass remains safe. Further moves expected to provide diminishing returns.",
