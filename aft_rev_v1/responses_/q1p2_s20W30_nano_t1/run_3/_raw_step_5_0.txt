Load at node_3 and supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller) fixed. Current free node_4 moved compared to earlier iteration to lower mass and maintain structure. Areas all fixed at \'2\'.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current max compressive stress is -13.82 on member_1 between node_1 and node_3. This cable takes largest load. Members have varying tensile/compressive stresses with significant axial forces on bottom chord. Node_4 position moved from 3.15,2.4 to now 2.3,2.9 reduced mass and shifted forces. Stress increased slightly possibly due to node_4 location. Current geometry is stable and satisfies constraints but max compressive stress can be optimized further by repositioning node_4 upwards or slightly more left or right to reduce high stress in member_1 and balance force distribution on diagonals.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Shifting node_4 position vertically upwards increases diagonal lengths which may reduce stress but risk mass increase. Slight horizontal shift right from 2.3 may reduce compressive stress in member_1 and offload tension in diagonals. Areas all at \'2\' currently but no instruction to change area this iteration. Node_3, node_1, node_2 fixed due to loads/supports; only node_4 movable.",\n\n  "reasoning": "To evenly distribute forces, node_4 should be repositioned at an optimized vertical height and small horizontal adjustment to balance diagonal angles. Increasing height from 2.9 to about 3.1 and shifting horizontal from 2.3 to ~2.4 or 2.45 may reduce max compressive stress on member_1 (bottom chord left) and tension on diagonals. This adjustment balances the compression and tension members, potentially lowering max stress without adding mass significantly.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assume node_4 from (2.3, 2.9) to (2.45, 3.1). Members length change calculated approximately to check mass impact. Mass is linear with length times fixed area per member \'2\' (area factor 0.782). Estimated increase in member_3,4 lengths minimal, mass increase expected below 0.5 units. Expect redistribution of axial forces decreasing max compressive stress in member_1 below 13.8 and tensile stresses on diagonals balanced.",\n\n  "calculation": "Member lengths roughly: member_3 approx length increase by sqrt((2.45-0)^2 + (3.1-0)^2)=3.72 vs current ~3.56; member_5 adjusted similarly. Mass increase less than 0.3 units. Max compressive stress expected decrease by ~5-10%. Total mass within 14 units well below constraint 30. Stress tolerances safe. No area or member connectivity changes. Node_4 moved to (2.45, 3.1).",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Move node_4 to (2.45, 3.1). Keep all members at area \'2\'. Confirm no violation of max stress ±20 or mass <=30. No duplicate nodes or members. Load node_3 and supports fixed. This small adjustment should minimize max stress further.
