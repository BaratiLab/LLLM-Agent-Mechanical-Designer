Current mass 14.74 well below max 30. Load applied down-left at node_3. Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Node_3 position fixed; node_4 can be optimized vertically/horizontally.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Stress is largest in member_1 (-12.49), connecting node_1 to node_3. This member is in compression. By adjusting node_4 position, force distribution can be improved to reduce high compression in member_1. Current cross-sectional areas are uniform (area_id \'2\'), which is moderate. Could try adjusting node_4 position to reduce bending and stress concentration while keeping members within constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider shifting node_4 slightly nearer to node_3 and slightly to the right to better balance top chord forces; do not move node_3 or supports. Lengths and areas need to keep mass low. Lengths of members not overly long so mass is reasonable.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_1 experiences highest compressive stress. Moving node_4 horizontally and vertically can redistribute forces. Increasing node_4 x-coordinate from 2.0 to about 2.5 will reduce compression on member_1 by reducing angle and force concentration. Slightly reducing node_4 y coordinate to 3.3 will reduce member_3 tension too. Keep area_id at 2 for all members to maintain balanced mass and stiffness. Member lengths are acceptable. Resulting mass will remain under 30 and stress under 20.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate new node positions: node_4 from (2.0,3.5) â†’ (2.5, 3.3). Member lengths reconsidered: member_1 length ~ sqrt((2.0-0)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 2 earlier, now with node_4 moved force better transferred via top chord. Mass likely roughly same. Stress will drop. Area_id stay \'2\'. No duplicate nodes or members.",\n  \n  "calculation": "New node_4 set to (2.5, 3.3) to rebalance force path. Members remain connecting same nodes with area_id \'2\'. Mass remains ~14.7. Expected max stress reduced from 12.49 to about 10-11 based on typical truss force redistribution. Constraints satisfied.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_final": "Ensure supports at node_1(0,0) pinned and node_2(6,0) roller unchanged. Node_3 fixed at (2,0). Node_4 moved to (2.5,3.3).
