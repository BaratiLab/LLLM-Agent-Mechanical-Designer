  "preamble": "Minimize max stress in 2D truss under given load/supports and constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress is 12.49 under limit 20. Current mass 14.74 well below max 30. Load applied down-left at node_3. Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Node_3 position fixed; node_4 can be optimized vertically/horizontally.",
  
  "analysis": "Stress is largest in member_1 (-12.49), connecting node_1 to node_3. This member is in compression. By adjusting node_4 position, force distribution can be improved to reduce high compression in member_1. Current cross-sectional areas are uniform (area_id '2'), which is moderate. Could try adjusting node_4 position to reduce bending and stress concentration while keeping members within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider shifting node_4 slightly nearer to node_3 and slightly to the right to better balance top chord forces; do not move node_3 or supports. Lengths and areas need to keep mass low. Lengths of members not overly long so mass is reasonable.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_1 experiences highest compressive stress. Moving node_4 horizontally and vertically can redistribute forces. Increasing node_4 x-coordinate from 2.0 to about 2.5 will reduce compression on member_1 by reducing angle and force concentration. Slightly reducing node_4 y coordinate to 3.3 will reduce member_3 tension too. Keep area_id at 2 for all members to maintain balanced mass and stiffness. Member lengths are acceptable. Resulting mass will remain under 30 and stress under 20.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate new node positions: node_4 from (2.0,3.5) â†’ (2.5, 3.3). Member lengths reconsidered: member_1 length ~ sqrt((2.0-0)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 2 earlier, now with node_4 moved force better transferred via top chord. Mass likely roughly same. Stress will drop. Area_id stay '2'. No duplicate nodes or members.",
  
  "calculation": "New node_4 set to (2.5, 3.3) to rebalance force path. Members remain connecting same nodes with area_id '2'. Mass remains ~14.7. Expected max stress reduced from 12.49 to about 10-11 based on typical truss force redistribution. Constraints satisfied.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Ensure supports at node_1(0,0) pinned and node_2(6,0) roller unchanged. Node_3 fixed at (2,0). Node_4 moved to (2.5,3.3). Member connections unchanged. Areas all '2' for consistency. Mass under 30, max stress under 20. Plan to next FEM validate to confirm stress reduction. Stop optimization only if max stress < 10 or no improvement after next iteration.",
