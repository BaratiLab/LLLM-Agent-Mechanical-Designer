Need a closed truss—must connect all nodes with members forming at least one closed loop. Constraints: max stress ±20, total mass ≤ 30 (mass sum = length×area). Areas selectable from discrete set. Keep nodes fixed in position except internal members can link nodes for stability.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The three nodes are colinear, leading to a degenerate truss if connected only linearly. To create a closed truss, add a new node above node_3 to form a triangle, enabling better force distribution and stress reduction. Place a new node_4 at some height y>0, connected to node_1, node_2, and node_3. Closed loop with four members: (node_1-node_4), (node_4-node_2), (node_4-node_3), plus base members (node_1-node_3) and (node_3-node_2).",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Choose node_4 at x=2.0 (vertical above node_3) at y~3.5 for a balanced triangle height. This avoids horizontal compression overload. Member lengths and chosen area must be such that stress under the applied load is below ±20 and mass ≤ 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "A triangular shape has better stiffness and load path. Load at node_3 (-10N at -45°) will induce tensile and compressive stresses in members. To minimize stress, select large enough area in key members (near loaded node) and smaller area for others. Use statics: resolve forces at nodes, analyze truss members axial forces simplistically (pin-jointed truss assumption). For mass, sum lengths×area over all members with area selected from discrete set. Balance to keep mass ≤ 30.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Members: Base - (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2); Diagonal braces - (node_1-node_4), (node_4-node_2), (node_4-node_3). Total 5 members. Calculate lengths: L13=2.0, L32=4.0, L14=sqrt((2-0)^2+3.5^2)=sqrt(4+12.25)=~3.64, L42=sqrt((6-2)^2+3.5^2)=sqrt(16+12.25)=~5.0, L43=3.5. Try assigning areas to keep stress and mass balanced.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths: L13=2.0, L32=4.0, L14=3.6401, L42=5.0, L43=3.5. Assume member forces from statics (simplified): load at node_3 decomposed into Fx=-10*cos45= -7.07 N, Fy=-10*sin45= -7.07 N. Support reactions distributed largely at node_1 and node_2. Members carrying horizontal forces: base members. Verticals/diagonals carry vertical and diagonal components. Approximate max force ~10N in some members. Stress σ=Force/Area. To keep σ ≤ 20, Area ≥ Force/20 ~ 10/20=0.5. Select area category \'2\' (0.782) for most loaded members, smaller for less loaded. Assign: (node_1-node_3): area=1 (0.195), low load aligned with pinned support; (node_3-node_2): area=2 (0.782), higher load; Diagonals (node_1-node_4), (node_4-node_3), and (node_4-node_2) area=2 (0.782). Total mass = sum(length×area): = 2×0.195 + 4×0.782 + 3.64×0.782 + 5×0.782 + 3.5×0.782 = 0.39 + 3.128 + 2.846 + 3.91 + 2.737 = 12.99 < 30, within limit. Approx max stress ~ load / area_min = 10/0.195=51 > 20, so base (node_1-node_3) area is too small. Increase base (node_1-node_3) area to \'2\' (0.782) giving max stress about 12.8 < 20. Recalculate mass: increases by (0.782-0.195)*2=1.174; total mass now ~ 14.16 < 30. Acceptable. Conclusion: all members area=\'2\'.
