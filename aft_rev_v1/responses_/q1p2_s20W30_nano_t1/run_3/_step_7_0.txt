  "preamble": "Optimized 4-node truss with 5 members under load with minimal stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current structure has max stress ~13.7 < 20 and mass ~14.1 < 30; load on node_3; supports fixed at nodes 1 and 2; node_4 position varied from iterations 0 to 6 to reduce stress.",
  "analysis": "Max compressive stress at member_1 (-13.7) close but below limit; tensile stresses moderate. Total mass low compared to max allowed. Node_4 moved in vertical and slightly horizontal directions yielding minimal stress changes around 13.6-13.8. No large room to reduce stress by node position changes in current topology.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "All members same area '2'. Since stress and mass within limits, changing areas or adding members could help, but instruction forbids adding nodes; must keep closed 2D truss with given nodes. Further node_4 position changes in past iterations didn't improve max stress significantly.",
  "reasoning": "Minimizing stress further by repositioning node_4 is unlikely to yield significant gains as recent steps show oscillation around max stress ~13.6-13.8. Member area is uniform '2' which balances mass and stress. Without changing topology or member areas (instruction unclear if allowed to change areas but current are all '2'), best design reached. Load and supports fixed; so node_4 at (2.47,3.2) optimal. Ensures stable, stiff truss, with max stress well below limits and mass far less than max mass.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Max stress <20, mass <30 constraint satisfied comfortably. Minor oscillations in max stress due to node_4 vertical position adjustments. Stresses in other members well below limits. No excessive member length changes or eccentricities detected in this configuration.",
  "calculation": "Minimal change in stress/max stress observed by node_4 movement from 2.3 to ~2.5 horizontally and 2.9 to 3.2 vertically. Mass stable near 14.1. Max stress plateaued near 13.7 â€” no further gain in stress reduction without significant design change.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Current design optimized for stress and mass under given load/support and topology. No new node addition or member area change recommended or allowed per instruction. Further optimization would yield negligible gains and risk violating constraints.",
