Mass ~14.3 well below 30 limit. Loads and supports fixed; node_4 is free and influences truss geometry significantly.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max compressive stress is high in member_1; tensile in member_3 moderate. Moving node_4 affects member lengths and angles, redistributing stresses. Reducing vertical height slightly or shifting node_4 horizontally can reduce stress peaks while keeping closed structure. Area assignments at \'2\' (0.782) for all members seem balanced to keep mass low. Lowering max stress closer to zero can improve safety factor.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Tensile stresses in member_3 and compressive in member_1 are key targets. Node_4 shifted from (2.0,3.5) to (2.5,3.3) reduced max stress but increased member_3 stress. A smaller height or slight horizontal move may optimize stress further, keeping load path balanced.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Reducing max compressive stress in member_1 by lowering node_4 height slightly will shorten member_3 and member_5, reducing tensile and compressive stresses respectively. A slight horizontal shift will maintain load paths to node_2 and node_1 supports. Keeping areas at \'2\' maintains reasonable mass. Avoid moving load/support nodes. Use precise floats for node_4 coordinates.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Positions: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0) fixed. Adjust node_4 Y from 3.3 down to ~3.0; X from 2.5 to 2.3. This yields shorter member_1 length, possibly lowering compression. Mass expected under 15. Max stress to aim <13.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Propose node_4 = (2.3, 3.0); holds balance between compression and tension members, keeps closed topology. Member areas remain at \'2\'. Estimate stress decrease from shortening member_1 and member_3 lengths by ~10%. Mass remains approx same (~14.3). Check: Member_1 length ~3.75 vs 3.75 current; slight yield expected on stress reducing.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Ensured no duplicates in nodes or members, supports and load nodes fixed, all member areas \'2\' (0.782) unchanged.
