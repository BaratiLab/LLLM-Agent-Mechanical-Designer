  "preamble": "Optimize a 2D truss under downward-left load with pinned and roller supports, meeting stress ±20 and mass ≤30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 (-10 N, -45 deg), supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Current max stress 29.1 > 20 limit, mass 25.9 < 30 limit. Need reduced max stress, maintain or reduce mass.",
  
  "analysis": "Current layout has stress violation mainly in member_5 (node_4-node_2) at -29.1. Members with zero or low stress (member_4, member_6) contribute mass without benefit. Nodes 4 and 5 are near load node_3. Member areas mostly '3' (~1.759 area) causing higher stress. Structure lacks sufficient triangulation near load to distribute force, causing local stress concentration. Options to reduce stress: redistribute nodes for better angle & length ratios, reduce redundant members, adjust member areas. Mass is under limit, but member_5 stress too high, candidate for redesign or area reduction.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce member_5 stress, either reduce length or area or redistribute load path. Moving node_4 closer to line between node_2 and node_3 reduces length, or alternatively, eliminating low-stress member_4 (area '0'=1, adding mass) and adding stiff members to triangulate better. Also, reassign area sizes to critical members to keep stress in range. Keep existing load and support nodes fixed.",
  
  "proposal": "Remove member_4 (node_5-node_4) - zero stress, saves mass. Move node_5 from (2.0, 2.8) to (2.0, 2.0) reducing distance for load transfer. Move node_4 slightly upward and toward node_3 (2.2,1.5) from (2.1,1.8) to reduce length and inclination to node_2. Redefine members with improved triangulation: member_3 (node_1-node_5) area '2', member_6 (node_3-node_5) area '3', new member_7 (node_4-node_5) area '1' for structural support, and member_5 area reduced to '1' to reduce stress and mass but keep capacity.",
  
  "reasoning": "Removing member_4 saves mass; node_5 lowered reduces bending lever arm and better aligns load path. Moving node_4 closer to node_3 shortens member_5, reducing stress. Adding member_7 (node_4-node_5) creates additional triangle to distribute forces efficiently. Area assignments prioritize high area (3) for members carrying higher load, keeping overall mass manageable. Load at node_3 is transferred via triangular webs to supports node_1 and node_2, reducing stress peaks.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: member_1 (node_1-node_3) = 2.0m, member_3 (node_1-node_5) ~2.828m, member_5 (node_4-node_2) shortened ~4.0m, use area from allowed set to keep stress ≤20, estimate mass = sum(length*area). Expected mass ~24-26 less than 30. Max stress expected below 20 due to improved triangulation and shorter high-stress members. Check load path angles for stability and stress spread.",
  
  "calculation": "member lengths and areas:\n- member_1 (node_1-node_3): length=2.0 m, area=3 => mass=2.0*1.759=3.518\n- member_2 (node_3-node_2): length=4.0 m, area=3 => mass=7.036\n- member_3 (node_1-node_5): length ~2.828, area=2(0.782) => mass=2.828*0.782=2.211\n- member_5 (node_4-node_2): length ~4.0, area=1(0.195) => mass=0.78\n- member_6 (node_3-node_5): length ~2.236, area=3(1.759) => mass=3.93\n- member_7 (node_4-node_5): length ~0.7, area=1 => mass=0.136\nTotal estimated mass ~17.6 < 30, margin for stress/area adjustments.\nExpected max stress keeps below 20 by shorter critical member and better load distribution.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Structure removes redundant member, fines node positions to optimize lengths and stresses, mixes area sizes to control mass and strength. Maintains original supports and load nodes. Triangle refinements reduce stress peaks. Member list unique, node coordinates float precise.",
