Mass under 30 but structure lacks sufficient bracing. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) are fixed. Load at node_3 at mid-span creates bending moment. Current mid nodes and members insufficient for stress control.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_3 (node1-node4) stress exceeds tensile limit; member_4 (node4-node2) stress high also. Member areas are too small or geometry inefficient. Load at node_3 causes high tension/compression forces. Current geometry: node_4 slightly above midspan (2.2, 1.8). Member_5 (node3-node4) helps but not enough. History shows adding intermediary node_5 didn\'t sufficiently reduce stress.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress, increase triangulation: add a node above node_3 to create two triangles spanning the load. Areas for highly stressed members must increase. Avoid adding heavy large areas where forces are low to control mass. Candidate areas: high stress members use area_id 5 or 6, others smaller. Need to add a node between node_3 and node_4 vertically aligned to balance forces.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node_5 at (2.0, 2.4) (above node_3), connect node_3-node_5 and node_5-node_4 and node_5-node_1. Adjust member areas: largest areas for members from node_1 and node_5, moderate for node_4-related. Remove member_5 (node_3-node_4) to reduce redundancy and stress concentration. Redefine members to create efficient load path and reduce max stress below ±20 and total mass under 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "A higher node_5 above node_3 will form a more stable triangulated pattern distributing the load from node_3 down to supports via node_5. Increasing area of members carrying large tension/compression will reduce stress below limits by increasing cross-section. Removing direct diagonal (node3-node4) which caused high tension and compressive forces helps redistribute stresses. Smaller areas where forces are small for mass optimization.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2.2,1.8), node_5(2.0,2.4).

Assign areas accordingly: large (5 or 6) for node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_5, to control stress; moderate (3-4) for node_5-node_4, node_4-node_2; smaller (2-3) for node_3-node_5. Check total mass below 30: sum(length × area) ≈ 2.0×7 + 4.0×7 + 2.88×7 + 0.67×1.76 + 4.1×1.76 + 2.4×1.76 = 14+28+20.16+1.18+7.2+4.22=74+ (too large).
