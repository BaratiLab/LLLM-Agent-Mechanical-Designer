  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to reduce stress while adhering to mass and stress constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 8.82 < 20 and total mass 25.6 < 30, structure safe. Nodes at load/support fixed.",
  
  "analysis": "Member 4 stress is zero, possibly inefficient area usage. Large area 4 used in member 3 (9.77 mass), likely overdesign. Member 6 has high compressive stress (-8.82), stiffening might help. Geometry with node5 above node4 changed from previous iteration. System is stable but can optimize mass distribution and stress better.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider repositioning node_5 upwards slightly to balance forces in members 3,4,6. Possibly reduce area in member 3, increase in member 6. Check alternative small repositioning of node_4 to improve force paths.",
  
  "reasoning": "Minimizing stress can be done by controlling load paths and member stiffness distribution. Keeping mass under 30 allows some flexibility. Areas used largely 3,4,2 which are mid-to-large sizes; rebalancing with smaller areas in less stressed members beneficial. Member 4 with zero stress suggests reducing its area to minimum (1) to save mass. Moving node_5 upwards and closer to node_4 reduces bending and redistributes stress. Ensure no movement of nodes 1,2,3 (support/load).",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Check length and angles of members affecting stress. Calculate mass = sum(length*area). Area ids map to effective cross-section and mass contribution. Member 4 area can be set to '0' (area=1) from '1'=0.195. Member 3 reduce area from 4 (3.128) to 3(1.759). Member 6 increase area from 2(0.782) to 3(1.759) to lower compressive stress. Move node_5 y from 2.4 to about 2.8 for better force distribution. Node_4 move slightly left x:2.2->2.1 to reduce stress in member 5.",
  
  "calculation": "Member lengths re-estimated: \n- member_1 length ~2.0,\n- member_2 length ~4.0,\n- member_3 length ~sqrt((2.0-0)^2 + (2.8-0)^2) = sqrt(4 +7.84) = ~3.6\n- member_6 length ~sqrt((2.0-2.0)^2 + (2.8-0)^2) = 2.8\nMass calculated with adjusted areas:\nMember_1 area 3 (1.759) length 2 * 1.759 = 3.518\nMember_2 area 3 (1.759) length 4 * 1.759 = 7.036\nMember_3 area 3 (1.759) length 3.6 * 1.759 = 6.33\nMember_4 area 0 (1) length ~0.7 *1=0.7\nMember_5 area 2 (0.782) length ~1.85 * 0.782=1.45\nMember_6 area 3 (1.759) length 2.8 * 1.759=4.93\nTotal mass approx 23.97 < 30\nStress expected to balance better, max stress < previous max 8.8\n",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New positions and areas reduce stress and mass, maintain constraints. No node duplication, connections consistent. Node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Members reassigned per updated areas. Structure remains closed with stable geometry.",
