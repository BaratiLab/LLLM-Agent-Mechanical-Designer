Current max stress 29.1 > 20 limit, mass 25.9 < 30 limit. Need reduced max stress, maintain or reduce mass.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current layout has stress violation mainly in member_5 (node_4-node_2) at -29.1. Members with zero or low stress (member_4, member_6) contribute mass without benefit. Nodes 4 and 5 are near load node_3. Member areas mostly \'3\' (~1.759 area) causing higher stress. Structure lacks sufficient triangulation near load to distribute force, causing local stress concentration. Options to reduce stress: redistribute nodes for better angle & length ratios, reduce redundant members, adjust member areas. Mass is under limit, but member_5 stress too high, candidate for redesign or area reduction.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce member_5 stress, either reduce length or area or redistribute load path. Moving node_4 closer to line between node_2 and node_3 reduces length, or alternatively, eliminating low-stress member_4 (area \'0\'=1, adding mass) and adding stiff members to triangulate better. Also, reassign area sizes to critical members to keep stress in range. Keep existing load and support nodes fixed.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove member_4 (node_5-node_4) - zero stress, saves mass. Move node_5 from (2.0, 2.8) to (2.0, 2.0) reducing distance for load transfer. Move node_4 slightly upward and toward node_3 (2.2,1.5) from (2.1,1.8) to reduce length and inclination to node_2. Redefine members with improved triangulation: member_3 (node_1-node_5) area \'2\', member_6 (node_3-node_5) area \'3\', new member_7 (node_4-node_5) area \'1\' for structural support, and member_5 area reduced to \'1\' to reduce stress and mass but keep capacity.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing member_4 saves mass; node_5 lowered reduces bending lever arm and better aligns load path. Moving node_4 closer to node_3 shortens member_5, reducing stress. Adding member_7 (node_4-node_5) creates additional triangle to distribute forces efficiently. Area assignments prioritize high area (3) for members carrying higher load, keeping overall mass manageable. Load at node_3 is transferred via triangular webs to supports node_1 and node_2, reducing stress peaks.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: member_1 (node_1-node_3) = 2.0m, member_3 (node_1-node_5) ~2.828m, member_5 (node_4-node_2) shortened ~4.0m, use area from allowed set to keep stress ≤20, estimate mass = sum(length*area).
