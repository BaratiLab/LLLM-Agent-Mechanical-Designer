    "preamble": "Optimize a 2D truss under given nodes, loads, and supports to minimize stress within ±20 and mass ≤ 30.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three nodes aligned mostly on x-axis with node_3 loaded diagonally; supports fixed at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Objective: close the truss and minimize stress and mass.",

    "analysis": "The input nodes are node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Load is -10N at node_3 in -45° direction. To form a closed truss, use these nodes and add a suitable node above to create triangulation reducing bending and distribute load. Constraints limit max stress to ±20 and total mass ≤ 30. Areas must be chosen from discrete set. Supports fix reaction forces and moments at node_1 and allow roller translation at node_2. Load induces tension/compression in members connected to node_3 and possibly additional node. Triangulation with one additional node above node_3 can help." ,
    "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 above node_3 at approx (2.8, 2.5) to form stable triangles (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_3, node_4, node_2). Connect members (1-3), (3-2), (1-4), (4-2), (3-4). Choose member areas minimizing mass but preventing overstress. Approximate member lengths with Euclidean distance. Calculate forces and check stress = force/area. Mass = sum(length*area), aim for ≤ 30.",

    "reasoning": "Add one node with y>0 near node_3 to break collinearity and create closed triangular loops. Five members form closed truss, ensuring load transfers efficiently. Larger areas on highly stressed members and smaller on others to conserve mass. Use static equilibrium to solve forces approximately assuming pin joints, axial force only. Use trigonometry for member force components.", 
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: axial forces only, load at node_3 fully carried by members connected to node_3 and new node_4. Support reactions at node_1 and node_2 balance load. Use method of joints on node_3 and node_4 to calculate forces by resolving load components. Calculate member lengths by distance formula. Stress = force/area ≤ ±20. Areas taken to satisfy stress and minimize mass. Mass = ∑(length*area). Area IDs selected from set with rounded float areas for ease.",
