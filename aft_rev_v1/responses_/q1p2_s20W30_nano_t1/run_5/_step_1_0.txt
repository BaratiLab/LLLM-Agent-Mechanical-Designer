  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss with load at node_3 and pinned/roller supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Goal: Max |stress| ≤ 20 and total mass ≤ 30. Current max stress ~38, mass ~6.73 under limits, so stress is primary violation.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design has 5 members: long bottom chords and short vertical/diagonal. High stress in members connected to node_4 (top node). Areas are uneven, some low (1 and 2). Stress peaks on member_3 (36.3 tensile) and member_5 (-38 compressive). Load at node_3 is downward-left (-10, -45°). Node_4 placed at (2.8, 2.5) is not optimal for stress distribution. Supports fixed. Need structure to better distribute load and reduce max stress below 20.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing area on high stress members raises mass but still under limit. Optimizing geometry (moving node_4) to reduce member lengths and hence stresses. Possibly add one more node for better triangulation and load path.",
  
  "proposal": "Retain nodes_1,2,3 fixed. Move node_4 slightly closer to node_3 and add node_5 above node_3 for better triangulation. Connect members to form two triangles sharing node_3. Adjust member areas with larger sections on heavily loaded members.",
  
  "reasoning": "Shorter members reduce stress; adding node_5 (over node_3 at about (2.0, 1.5)) creates stiffer triangular configurations. Using larger areas (4 or 5) on high load members to reduce stress. Members with lower stress can use smaller sections to save mass. Total mass budget allows room to increase area on critical members from 1 or 2 to 4 or 5. Triangulation ensures stability and efficient load paths.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4 from (2.8,2.5) to (2.2,1.8) reduces length and stress. Node_5 at (2.0,1.5). Members: node_1-node_3 (area 4), node_3-node_2 (area 4), node_1-node_4 (area 2), node_4-node_2 (area 2), node_3-node_4 (area 3), node_3-node_5 (area 3), node_4-node_5 (area 2). Calculate approximate lengths and mass and check stress feasibility.",
  
  "calculation": "Member lengths approx: m1(1-3): 2.0; m2(3-2):4.0; m3(1-4): ~2.83; m4(4-2): ~3.8; m5(3-4): ~1.3; m6(3-5): ~1.5; m7(4-5): ~0.78. Mass = sum(length * area_factor), e.g. m1=2*3.128=6.256, m2=4*3.128=12.512, etc. Check total sum <30, stress reduced due to higher areas and better geometry. Expect max stress <20 with this setup.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All members connected without duplicates, no load/support node moved. Triangular formations reduce bending and shear, improving stress distribution. Mass under 30, stresses below ±20 expected. Ready for implementation and validation.",
