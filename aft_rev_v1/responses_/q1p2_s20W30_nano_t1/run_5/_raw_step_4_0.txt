Nodes at load/support fixed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member 4 stress is zero, possibly inefficient area usage. Large area 4 used in member 3 (9.77 mass), likely overdesign. Member 6 has high compressive stress (-8.82), stiffening might help. Geometry with node5 above node4 changed from previous iteration. System is stable but can optimize mass distribution and stress better.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider repositioning node_5 upwards slightly to balance forces in members 3,4,6. Possibly reduce area in member 3, increase in member 6. Check alternative small repositioning of node_4 to improve force paths.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Minimizing stress can be done by controlling load paths and member stiffness distribution. Keeping mass under 30 allows some flexibility. Areas used largely 3,4,2 which are mid-to-large sizes; rebalancing with smaller areas in less stressed members beneficial. Member 4 with zero stress suggests reducing its area to minimum (1) to save mass. Moving node_5 upwards and closer to node_4 reduces bending and redistributes stress. Ensure no movement of nodes 1,2,3 (support/load).",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check length and angles of members affecting stress. Calculate mass = sum(length*area). Area ids map to effective cross-section and mass contribution. Member 4 area can be set to \'0\' (area=1) from \'1\'=0.195. Member 3 reduce area from 4 (3.128) to 3(1.759). Member 6 increase area from 2(0.782) to 3(1.759) to lower compressive stress. Move node_5 y from 2.4 to about 2.8 for better force distribution.
