  "preamble": "Optimized 2D truss at iteration 7 meets constraints with minimal stress.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass ≤ 30. Current max stress ~7.16, mass ~25.84, within limits.",
  
  "analysis": "Current structure balanced stress distribution with max stress well below limit. Mass is below the max allowed. Nodes at load and support fixed. Minor positional adjustments previously made effectively reduced peak stresses.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Trend shows incremental node repositioning reducing max stress steadily while maintaining mass under limits. All members assigned appropriate areas from given set to balance stress and weight.",

  "reasoning": "Max stress is significantly below allowable ±20 threshold; further reduction likely yields diminishing returns given current geometry. Mass usage is reasonable and distribution of member areas balanced for load paths. Node placement of free nodes formed an effective internal bracing configuration. No overstressed members or inefficient mass usage detected.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress magnitudes range mostly <7.2, with all members well within tensile/compressive limits. Areas are appropriately scaled with length and stress to avoid excess mass or stress concentration. Free nodes positioned to form effective triangulation minimizing bending forces.",

  "calculation": "No member exceeds stress ±20. Total mass (25.84) comfortably below 30. Further node adjustments show only marginal changes in stresses. Load and support nodes fixed. Incremental positional changes not needed.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met with good safety margin. Structure is closed, well triangulated, no redundant members. No duplicate nodes or members. Areas chosen from allowed set. Nodes precisely positioned as floats.",
