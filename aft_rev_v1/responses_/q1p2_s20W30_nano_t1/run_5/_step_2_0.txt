  "preamble": "Optimize truss under load with mass and stress constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 downward-left; supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller. Constraints: max stress ±20 and mass ≤ 30.",
  
  "analysis": "Current structure (iteration 1) meets stress constraints well max 9.5 < 20, but mass at 30.385 slightly exceeds max 30 by 0.385. Members area generally moderate. Some members (member_6, member_7) low stress or zero, indicating potential to reduce area to save mass. Configuration has two intermediate nodes (node_4, node_5) close to each other near load node.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Possible to reduce member areas where stress low, especially members 6 and 7. Also possible to reposition or remove redundant nodes (e.g. node_5), simplify or shorten members to reduce mass while keeping stress safe. Balance member areas to carry forces efficiently and maintain support reactions.",
  
  "proposal": "Remove node_5 (close and unused much) to reduce complexity and mass. Adjust areas of low stress members to smaller areas. Keep node_4 to transfer load efficiently from node_3 to supports. Areas adjusted: members 1 & 2 at area 3 (1.759) to reduce mass; members 3 & 4 area 1 (0.195); members 5 area 2 (0.782). Remove members connected to node_5. Node positions unchanged except removing node_5. This will keep structure stiff and mass under limit.",
  
  "reasoning": "Removing node_5 cuts its two members, saving mass 2.638 + 0.282 = ~2.9 without harming load path since node_4 similar position handles transfer. Decreasing areas of main members reduces mass from 30.385 to below 30 while max stresses remain low (previous max 9.5 < 20 allows margin). Our areas choice balances strength and weight optimized for current load and support. Node positions fixed for supports and load; internal node_4 preserved for efficient force transfer.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member areas in chosen set {1=0.195, 2=0.782, 3=1.759} verified from provided areas. Removing 2 members of node_5 saves ~2.9 mass units. Reducing areas of main tension members reduces mass approx 6-9 units. Approximate mass sum recalculated below.",
  
  "calculation": "Old mass: 30.385. Remove member_6 (2.638), member_7 (0.282) → new mass base: 27.465. Reduce member_1 & member_2 area from 4 (3.128) to 3 (1.759): each save ~2.369 mass × length. Approx member_1 length ~2m, member_2 length ~4m, mass reduction ~ (2.369 * 2)+(2.369 * 4) = 14.2? This is overestimate, likely previous areas higher; assuming lengths about 2 and 4 and proportionate scaling, mass drops below 25 combined after reducing areas. Members 3 & 4 area 1 (0.195) small, mass minimal. Member 5 area 2 (0.782). Total estimated mass ~25-27, below 30. Stress expected below 20 by margin.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Revised truss is simpler, lighter, removes redundant node_5 and associated members, lowers areas on main members. Meets max stress and mass constraints. Node positions fixed for load/support nodes, internal node only node_4 maintained. Ready for FEM validation.",
