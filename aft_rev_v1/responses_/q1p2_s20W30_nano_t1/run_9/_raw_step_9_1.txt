Load at node_3, supports pinned node_1, roller node_2. Areas mostly 1 and 2. Nodal displacement limited to non-load/support nodes.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The current truss with 5 nodes (two fixed at boundaries), six members with moderate area choices results in low max stress (9.2) and low total mass (8.4). Members carrying 0 stress could be optimized but are already low mass. Node_5 repositioned to 3.2,1.5 is balanced for load transfer. No stress constraint violations or excessive mass present.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further stress reduction possible only with significant topology changes or larger areas increasing mass. Current area assignments and geometry efficiently distribute forces within constraints.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Nodes at supports remain fixed. Node_5 position and member areas chosen to balance load transfer effectively resulting in low max stress. Areas selected from catalog maintain mass well below 30. Members with zero stress are small area and short length, minimal mass impact. No signs of buckling or localized high stress. Increasing member areas reduces stress but increases mass. Current low stress with low mass implies near-optimal design given constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member_1 and member_2 largest stresses at ~9, below limit 20. Mass sum verified below 30. Members 3,4,5 near zero stress suggest well-distributed force paths. Geometry stable and statically determinate. No need to add nodes or members since complexity and mass would increase.",\n\n  "calculation": "Checking lengths: member_1 length = distance(node_1,node_3) = 2, area 2; mass = length * area = 2*0.782=1.564 (matches). Similarly member_2 length ~3.2, area 2 -> mass ~2.5024 consistent. Sum of member masses matches total ~8.4. Max stress far below limits. No load or support positions changed. Small moves from previous iteration improved stress from ~10.0 to 9.2.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Adhered to constraints, all nodes and members valid, no duplicates. Geometry stable and optimal for 25 iterations given current constraints and loads.
