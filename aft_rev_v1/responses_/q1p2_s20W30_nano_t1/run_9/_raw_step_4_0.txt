Member areas mostly 2 or 3 (medium-large). Load applied at node_3 (-10 at 45 degrees down-left). Structure is a closed polygon with nodes (1,2 fixed, 3,4,5 free except 3 fixed by load). Node_5 acts as a joint between members 3,4,5. Member_1 (node_1-node_3) long and highly stressed. Shifting node_3 is not allowed (load node). Need to adjust node_4 and node_5 positions to redistribute forces and reduce peak stresses, possibly reduce area of highly stressed members afterwards.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "High compression in member_1 suggests bending at node_3 or poor force path. Increasing vertical height at node_4 or adjusting node_5 vertically/horizontally can relax forces. Ensuring member lengths and areas do not increase mass above 30. Keeping closed truss shape is critical.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "By raising node_4 slightly (currently at y=3.0), the vertical component of load can better distribute. Shifting node_5 closer to node_4 vertically or somewhat left can reduce stress in member_1 and member_3. Reduce excessive compression by creating more balanced triangle shapes. Re-assign member areas after geometry change to minimize stress and mass while respecting max stress ±20. Consider reducing area of member_1 if stress drops sufficiently.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: linear elastic behavior, member forces proportional to geometry and area. Member stress σ = Force / (Area × cross section), length fixed by node coordinates. Plan: increment node_4 y from 3.0 to ~3.3, and node_5 x from 4.0 to ~3.7, y slightly increased near 1.7 to improve force path. Recalculate stress estimations qualitatively: higher node_4 lifts load path, reducing compression in bottom chord member_1.",\n  \n  "calculation": "New node positions: node_4: (2.0, 3.3), node_5: (3.7, 1.7). Members lengths recalculated using Euclidean distance. Approximate mass recalculated using length × area from dict. Verify max stress within ±20 by reducing member_1 area from \'3\' to \'2\' (1.759 → 0.782) if stress improves. Maintain other members areas or adjust based on new stress estimations. Total mass recalculated with new areas and lengths to ensure <30.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 lifted to increase height and reduce compression, node_5 moved left/up to rebalance truss, member_1 area decreased, member_3 area maintained, others unchanged.
