Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Nodes fixed for load/support. Current max stress is 29.05 > 20 allowed. Total mass 8.72 < 30 allowed. Goal: reduce max stress to ≤20 while maintaining low mass.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design max stress exceeds tensile/compressive limit, notably in member_4 (node_1-node_4), stress=29.05. Total mass is acceptable but high stress suggests redesign of load paths and member areas. Current layout: nodes linear and one elevated node_4 at y=3 forms a triangle. Member_4 under high stress possibly due to direct load path or insufficient cross section area. Members with area_id 1 or 2 chosen, but with high stress. There\'s small redundancy.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add a diagonally placed intermediate node between node_3 and node_2 to reduce stress in longer members between supports and loaded node. Rebalance member areas. Use optimal areas from lookup, favor moderate area (e.g. area_id 3 or 4) to reduce stress. Remove or avoid members causing stress concentration. Members connecting load node to both supports directly for load path. Adjust geometry slightly within constraints without moving support/load nodes.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (4.0, 1.5) between node_3 and node_2 elevated, to create two triangles sharing load. Update members to connect node_3-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_5-node_4. Increase cross section areas with area_id \'3\' or \'4\' to reduce stress. Remove member_4 (node_1-node_4) with high stress and replace with members forming lower stress truss. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_3-node_5.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Introducing node_5 improves load distribution and allows smaller stresses in members by adding more load paths, reducing stress concentration seen in previous design. Adjusted areas increase capacity under load. Keeping node_1 and node_2 fixed preserves support conditions. Two triangles are statically stable and efficient. Estimated mass should stay under 30 given moderate areas and member lengths.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approx: node_1-node_3 (~2m), node_3-node_4 (~3m), node_4-node_5 (~2.12m), node_5-node_2 (~1.5m), node_3-node_5 (~2.5m).

Approx mass: sum(length*area) ~ (2*1.759)+(3*1.759)+(2.12*0.782)+(1.5*1.759)+(2.5*1.759) = 3.518+5.277+1.658+2.638+4.398=17.49 < 30 allowed.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Max allowable stress ±20.
