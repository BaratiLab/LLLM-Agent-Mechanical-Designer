Existing nodes at supports and load fixed; move only node_4 and node_5. Members mostly with area 0 (1) or 1 (0.195) and 2(0.782). Stress fairly low, potential to reduce by better force flow. Node_5 moved closer to center in previous step, small upward move possible. Currently minimal stress on diagonal members.",\n  "analysis": "Current design is stable, closed truss with members mostly low area except some at 2. Max stress well within limits. Load applied at node_3 (2,0) at -10 N and -45°. Node_4 at (2,3), node_5 at (3.4,1.4). Long members have moderate cross-section. The compressive and tensile stresses are moderate; member_1 highest compression (-10.07). Strategy to slightly adjust node_4 up to reduce bending moment, and node_5 nearer the load for better load distribution. Increase areas on highly tensioned/compressed members if needed. Goal to reduce max stress below 10 if possible without increasing mass too much.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Slightly raise node_4 y from 3.0 to about 3.2; move node_5 marginally closer to node_4 along a line between current pos (3.4,1.4) and (2,3). Keep cross-section for member_1, 2 and 6 at area 2 (0.782). Upgrade member_3 and 5 from area 0 (1) to area 1 (0.195) to reduce stress, reducing mass increase. Member_4 low stress at 0.597, area 1 is acceptable.",\n  "reasoning": "Increasing node_4 y increases truss height, shortening compressive member lengths and may better distribute axial forces. Moving node_5 closer and optimizing area reduces stress concentration. Prior iterations showed larger areas increase mass but reduce stress. This approach balances cross-section upgrade and minimal node repositioning. Area selection adheres to provided discrete values. The maximum mass keeps within 30 limit; current mass 11.41 leaves room for slight increase.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approx: member_1 = dist((0,0)-(2,0))=2, member_2 = dist((2,0)-(2,3.2))=3.2, member_3 = dist((2,3.2)-(3.2,1.5)) ≈1.88, member_4 = dist((3.2,1.5)-(6,0)) ≈3.41, member_5 = dist((2,0)-(3.2,1.5)) ≈1.8, member_6 = dist((0,0)-(2,3.2)) ≈ 3.71; member_mass = length * area factor. New areas: member_1,2,6 = 0.782, member_3,5 = 0.195, member_4=0.195. Total mass estimated under 13. Stress expected reduction due to improved geometry and cross section.",\n  "calculation": "Node_4: from (2.0, 3.0) to (2.0, 3.2). Node_5: from (3.4,1.4) to (3.2,1.5).

This is less than original mass 11.41, allowing for increased member areas with less mass due to reduced lengths. Expect stress reduction due to more favorable geometry and slightly increased cross-sections. Reset member_4 area to 1 to avoid mass increase.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Design movement limited to node_4 and node_5 within allowable degrees. Keep load/support nodes fixed.
