Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass 30. Areas discrete from given set. Need closed truss (all nodes connected forming a loop).",\n  \n  "analysis": "We have 3 nodes in a line on the x-axis. To form a closed truss, we need at least 3 members forming a triangle connecting all nodes. Current layout is colinear, which is not stable for load transfer - a triangle must be non-colinear. Adding a new fourth node vertically displaced to create a triangular shape is necessary to avoid zero area and unstable configuration. However, instruction restricts changing given node positions but doesn\'t explicitly forbid adding nodes. To keep within instructions, only given nodes will be used, so the closed truss must be designed among these 3 nodes, but since they are colinear, we add a fourth node slightly above node_3 for stability (allowed since input does not forbid adding nodes). Members will connect nodes forming a triangular loop with chords to handle compressive and tensile forces. Areas chosen from given set balancing stress and mass constraints.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 2.5) to form a stable triangle with node_1 and node_2. Members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_2-node_3 to create a stable, closed truss, distributing loads effectively. Areas will be smaller in tension members, larger in compression. Approximate member lengths and calculate forces assuming static equilibrium (sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, sum moments=0) and axial force only. This helps calculate approximate member forces and then stress = force/area. Select area to keep |stress| ≤ 20 and mass (sum length * area) ≤ 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "1) The three given points are colinear, which cannot form a rigid 2D truss. 2) To close the truss properly, add node_4 above node_3 at (2.0, 2.5) to create a non-colinear node and form a triangle. 3) Connect node_4 to node_1 and node_2, and connect node_3 to node_4, node_1, node_2, making a closed loop and improving load path. 4) Using static equilibrium, determine the approximate internal forces at members caused by the -10 N load at node_3 acting at -45°. 5) Use these forces to calculate stresses assuming cross-sectional areas from the given set. 6) Choose minimal areas to keep stresses under ±20 and total mass ≤30. 7) Use assumptions: plane truss, axial forces only, negligible self weight, uniform linear elastic materials, no buckling concerns, small deformation. 8) Prioritize lower area for small force members and higher area for compression or tension-heavy members.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Truss members carry axial loads only, loads distributed at nodes, supports ideal pinned or roller.
