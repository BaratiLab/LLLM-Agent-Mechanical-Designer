Current max stress 22.8>20 on member_4, mass 10.07 well below 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_4 (node_2 to node_4) has stress 22.8>20; mass is acceptable. Current structure short in capacity along node_2-to-node_4. Node positions fixed for supports and load. Area of member_4 is 0.195 (area_id=1). Increasing area or rerouting forces needed.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding a diagonal brace from node_3 to node_2 or shifting node_4 slightly to reduce stress on member_4. Could increase area in critical member_4 and reduce in less stressed members to balance mass.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add new node_5 above node_2 for better force distribution. Connect node_5 to node_2, node_4 and node_3. Increase area of member_4 to area_id \'4\' (3.128) to reduce stress. Adjust areas in members accordingly to stay under max mass and stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 adds a load path relieving member_4. Larger area for member_4 reduces stress. Additional members increase global stiffness and reduce stress concentrations. Areas chosen to trade-off mass and strength. Node_5 positioned vertically above node_2 for geometric advantage and minimal length increase.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths to estimate mass: node_2(6,0) to node_5(6,2.5) length 2.5; node_5 to node_4(2,2.5) length 4.0; node_5 to node_3(2,0) length ~4.47. Evaluate stresses assuming redistributed loads and larger cross section to cut stress of critical member.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member masses approximated by length × area. Member_4 length ~2.5, area increased to 3.128, mass ~7.82; other members kept to smaller areas to offset. Total mass sum estimated under 30. Stress recalculated lower by area increase and added load paths.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify stress ≤20 and mass ≤30 with renumbered members. No node moves for supports and loads.
