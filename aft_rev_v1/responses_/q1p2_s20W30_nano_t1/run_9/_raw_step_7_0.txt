Load at node_3 and supports fixed, node_4 and node_5 freely movable. Current design closed with 6 members, node_6 removed from previous iteration reduces complexity and mass. Reposition node_5 slightly to optimize force flow and balance tension/compression. Adjust cross-sectional areas aiming to reduce max stress and balance mass. Member_3 causing tensile stress near 17, keep area minimal to reduce mass but enough to carry load.",\n   "scratch_pad_2":"Consider moving node_5 closer to node_4 to reduce tension in member_3 and member_5; possibly increase area in member_1 (currently \'2\') for compression, reduce area in low-stress members.",\n   \n   "reasoning":"Moving node_5 closer to node_4 reduces lever arm of tensile force on member_3 and member_5 thus reduces tensile stress, maintaining stability. Member_4 currently zero stress, its area \'2\' can be reduced to \'1\' or \'0\'. Member_6 connecting node_1 to node_4 under moderate compression can stay same or reduce area if stress allows.

Areas update: member_3 area \'0\' (1.0) to keep low stress, member_5 also \'0\'; reduce member_4 (node_5-node_2) area from \'2\' to \'1\' (0.195) since stress 0; member_1,2,6 remain at \'2\' (0.782) to balance forces. Expect slight mass increase but still far < 30. Reducing area of member_4 lowers mass by about length*0.782 to length*0.195, gain ~1.3 mass units.
