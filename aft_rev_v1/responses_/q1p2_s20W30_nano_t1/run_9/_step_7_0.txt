   "preamble":"Optimize current structure to reduce max stress under 20 with minimal mass increase.",
   "scratch_pad_1":"Current max stress 16.94 < 20 limit, total mass 9.66 < 30 limit; improve stress distribution by repositioning node_5 and adjusting areas.",
   
   "analysis":"Max stress is under allowable limit, but some members (3,5) with area_id '1' and member_3 highest tensile stress 16.94. Load at node_3 and supports fixed, node_4 and node_5 freely movable. Current design closed with 6 members, node_6 removed from previous iteration reduces complexity and mass. Reposition node_5 slightly to optimize force flow and balance tension/compression. Adjust cross-sectional areas aiming to reduce max stress and balance mass. Member_3 causing tensile stress near 17, keep area minimal to reduce mass but enough to carry load.",
   "scratch_pad_2":"Consider moving node_5 closer to node_4 to reduce tension in member_3 and member_5; possibly increase area in member_1 (currently '2') for compression, reduce area in low-stress members.",
   
   "reasoning":"Moving node_5 closer to node_4 reduces lever arm of tensile force on member_3 and member_5 thus reduces tensile stress, maintaining stability. Member_4 currently zero stress, its area '2' can be reduced to '1' or '0'. Member_6 connecting node_1 to node_4 under moderate compression can stay same or reduce area if stress allows. Member_2 and member_1 compression gradually decreased by small geometry changes to improve load path. Overall mass considered, reductions possible without breaking constraints.",
   "scratch_pad_3":"Areas possible: '0':1, '1':0.195, '2':0.782, '3':1.759. Member lengths approximated by node distance so area Ã— length = mass. Target max stress <17 ideally down to 15-16. Mass target <10 kg to allow area increases if needed.",
   
   "calculation":"Node reposition: node_5 from (4.0,1.5) to approx (3.4,1.4) reduces moment arm. Member lengths approx: m3 (node_4-node_5): new length ~ sqrt((3.4-2)^2+(1.4-3)^2)=~1.9, current ~1.8. Areas update: member_3 area '0' (1.0) to keep low stress, member_5 also '0'; reduce member_4 (node_5-node_2) area from '2' to '1' (0.195) since stress 0; member_1,2,6 remain at '2' (0.782) to balance forces. Expect slight mass increase but still far < 30. Reducing area of member_4 lowers mass by about length*0.782 to length*0.195, gain ~1.3 mass units. Final mass estimate ~8.5-9, max stress estimate ~16 down slightly from 16.9 by improved geometry.",
   "scratch_pad_final":"All instructions followed: load/support nodes fixed, no duplicated nodes, areas chosen from set, closed truss maintained, constraints satisfied: max stress approx 16, total mass <30. Confidence in better stress distribution.",
