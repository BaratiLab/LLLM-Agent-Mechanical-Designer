Supports pinned node_1 and roller node_2. Current max stress exceeds ±20 and close to mass limit.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current design has excessive compressive stress (-40.97) at member_8 (node_5-node_2) and member_2 area too large (4) causing high mass (11.26). Node_6 adds complexity without stress relief. Load at node_3 is eccentric, requiring effective triangulation and load path. Need to reduce member areas and redesign topology to distribute forces evenly and reduce mass.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Maintain supports and load nodes fixed. Reduce/eliminate node_6 to simplify. Adjust node_4 and node_5 for better force flow. Use smaller areas on tension members; increase on critical compressive ones carefully but keep stress ≤20. Consider classic triangular truss patterns for stability and load transfer.",\n\n    "proposal": "Redesign with nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (2,3.0), node_5 (4.0,1.5). Members connect: 1-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-2, 3-5, 1-4. Select areas: smallest possible consistent with stress. Remove node_6 and member_7/member_8 to reduce complexity and mass.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Triangular pattern (nodes 1-3-4 and 3-5-2) provides good stability and load path. Node_5 placed to balance compression/tension. Areas assigned to keep stresses within ±20 and mass under 30. Use area \'2\' (0.782) for compression members, area \'1\' (0.195) for tension members where possible. Remove extra nodes and members that add mass but no benefit. This reduces max stress and mass efficiently.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: 1-3 ~2.0, 3-4 ~3.0, 4-5 ~2.06, 5-2 ~1.8, 3-5 ~2.5, 1-4 ~3.0 approx. Area to stress ratio balanced. Check mass sum(member_length*area value). Assume tensile members smaller area to reduce weight.
