The load is 10 units at 45° down-left. To form a closed truss, additional nodes are needed off the x-axis for geometric stability and load path. Introducing an apex node (node_4) above node_3 creates a typical triangular truss shape. Members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_4. This forms a closed polygon. Area selection will balance stress and mass. Approximate member lengths and calculate forces using static equilibrium and truss member axial force assumptions.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 above node_3 at (2.0, y), initial guess y=3.0. Calculate member lengths and forces. Assign small areas for long members to reduce mass and larger areas on high force members for stress constraints. Iterate if stress or mass limits are violated.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Using a triangular truss approach, the apex supports vertical load components reducing bending. Assuming pin-jointed members, forces are found via method of joints or sections. Member length calculation via Euclidean distance. Stress = force / area. Max area from given list 19.548. Choose member areas to keep stress ≤ ±30. Mass estimate = sum(member length × area).
