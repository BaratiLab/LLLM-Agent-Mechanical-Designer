Load at node_3 fixed, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Current max stress is 12.24 and mass 27.12, close to limit.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has low max stress, but mass is high (27.12) and some members carry very different stresses. Members 1 and 5 have relatively high compressive stresses. The top node_5 is far up, increasing member lengths to supports, thus increasing mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_5 slightly downward and/or closer horizontally towards node_4 to reduce member length to supports, reducing mass and stress. Could increase area of highly stressed members modestly and reduce area of lightly stressed members to balance mass and stress. Members near base (member_6 and 7) have large areas (area_id=0=1), consider lowering these to smaller areas if stress allows to reduce mass.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Reducing node_5 height and horizontal offset reduces member lengths and hence mass. Also balances forces better thus reducing stress. Altering area from largest to mid-level for low stress members can reduce mass. Members 6 and 7 can be assigned to smaller area, as their stress is low (~1.5 to 2.6). Members 1 and 5 with higher compressive stress require moderate or large area to keep stress low. The aim is to minimize max stress <30 and mass <30 with stress as objective to minimize.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Areas: member_6 and member_7 from \'0\' (1.0) to \'1\' (0.195) or \'2\' (0.782) reducing mass notably.

Reassign member areas accordingly.",\n\n  "calculation": "Node_5 new pos: (1.7, 4.3).
