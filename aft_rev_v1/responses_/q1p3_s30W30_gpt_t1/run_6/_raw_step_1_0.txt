Other members safe. Total mass 10.25 < 30, so mass is acceptable. Current topology is simple: 2 bottom nodes fixed, node_3 load node between, node_4 above node_3. Members from base nodes to load nodes. Need to reduce stress in member_1 by stiffening or rearranging members to share load better. Current areas: member_1 and 2 area=0.195; members_3,4,5 area=0.782. Increase area selectively or change topology to add redundancy and shorten critical length. Also consider adding a node higher above node_4 to form more load paths and reduce stress concentrations.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Mass can be increased but not beyond 30. Larger area members increase mass and reduce stress. Current max stress is almost double allowed. Need to reduce length or increase area of critical members or add members to distribute load. Avoid changing fixed and load nodes. Current nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), (2,3). Possibly add node above node_4 around (2,5) to form a triangle truss, redistribute forces to reduce stress in member_1. Connect new node with nodes 1 and 2 to add paths. Increase critical areas for members carrying axial forces beyond limit.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add \'node_5\' at (2.0, 5.0). Connect \'node_5\' to \'node_1\', \'node_2\' and \'node_4\'. Reassign areas: member_1 and 2 to area_id \'2\' (0.782), members adjacent to new node use area_id \'3\' (1.759) to increase capacity. Keep others at existing or adjusted areas. Remove minimal members only if redundant. Update topology to members: [\'member_1\': node_1-node_3, \'member_2\': node_2-node_3, \'member_3\': node_1-node_4, \'member_4\': node_2-node_4, \'member_5\': node_3-node_4, \'member_6\': node_1-node_5, \'member_7\': node_2-node_5, \'member_8\': node_4-node_5].",\n\n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 creates an upper triangle to redistribute the load from node_3 and node_4 to supports more efficiently, reducing compressive stress in member_1. Increasing cross section area of members subject to high stress reduces stress by increasing axial capacity. The new topology introduces more stable triangulation, minimizing moment effects. This approach reduces stress concentration on member_1 and helps keep total mass low and under limit.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2m, node_2-node_3=4m, node_1-node_4=3.605m, node_2-node_4=4.472m, node_3-node_4=3m; node_1-node_5=5m, node_2-node_5=5m, node_4-node_5=2m. Estimated mass = sum(length * area) with area from area_id. Total mass < 30 after increasing areas moderately. Axial force redistribution due to added members will reduce peak stress.
