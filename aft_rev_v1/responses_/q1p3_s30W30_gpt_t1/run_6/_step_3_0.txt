  "preamble": "Current truss is within stress and mass constraints with low maximum stress.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 5.54 << 30, total mass 28.07 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_5 refined position reduced stress.",
  "analysis": "Stress levels decreased significantly from iteration 1 to 2, mass increased slightly but is still under limit. No member exceeds stress constraints. Geometry modifications yielded a better stress distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further repositioning node_5 or changing areas may marginally reduce stress but risks violating mass or topology constraints. Existing members and nodes form a stable closed truss.",
  "reasoning": "Since max stress is well below 30 and mass limit is not reached, further optimization gains on stress are minimal. Node_5 adjustment improved stress balance. Maintaining topology and support nodes is mandatory. Changing only node_5 position has diminishing returns given current results.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Check area assignments: largest areas on critical members (3 and 5) reduce stress peaks. Node_5 reposition optimized load path and member force distribution. Members all under stress limits well away from ±30.",
  "calculation": "Member stresses all within ±5.54 max, much less than ±30 allowable. Total mass 28.0671 < 30. No violation of constraints. Small margins suggest structure is near optimal.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Stop optimization to prevent unnecessary adjustments that risk constraint violations. Current design optimal considering load, supports, mass, and stress minimization.",
