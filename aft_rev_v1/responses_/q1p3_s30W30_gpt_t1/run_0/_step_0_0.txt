  "preamble": "Optimize a closed 2D truss minimizing stress under load and support constraints with limited mass.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes fixed at node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Load at node_3: magnitude 10 units at -45°. Supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller. Max stress ±30, max mass 30. Areas discrete between 0.195 to 19.548 for members. Need closed truss, so all nodes connected and forming closed shape.",
  
  "analysis": "The given nodes are colinear along the x-axis which would create zero-area structure if only connected linearly. To form a closed truss, add at least one non-colinear node above the line creating a triangle with load at node_3. Ideal to raise a node above node_3 around (2, y) or towards the middle of node_1 and node_2 for stiffness. Members will be edges among nodes to form triangle to achieve closure ensuring equilibrium under vertical and horizontal load components. Use truss statics to approximate member forces and select area minimizing stress and mass.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (3.0, 3.0) approx above x-axis near load node_3. Members: (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), (node_1-node_4), (node_4-node_2), (node_3-node_4). This forms a closed polygon. Calculate lengths, estimate forces assuming load at node_3 acts downward and left diagonal, get member forces, assign areas from provided discrete set to control stresses within ±30. Sum member mass = length × area. Keep mass < 30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Load at node_3 push diagonally downward-left; reaction mostly at node_1 pinned (two reactions) and node_2 roller (vertical only). Top node_4 added to triangulate, distribute forces, reduce max stress. Estimate member forces statically with assumptions: axial forces only, pin joints. Use geometry for lengths, forces from equilibrium. Select areas to keep stresses within limits and keep total mass within 30. Preference for smaller area where possible to reduce mass.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assume member force magnitude proportional to load and geometry. Stress = Force / Area. Force approximated by static equilibrium (sum forces and moments about supports). Start with small area for long members since force may be less, increase area for members with high force. Calculate member lengths with Euclidean distance. Area id selection to keep |stress| ≤ 30. Total mass = sum(length × area). Check closure and constraints.",
