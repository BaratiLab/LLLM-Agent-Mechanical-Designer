Stress distribution balanced; max compressive -15.07, max tensile 8.53. Load at node_3 downward-left; supports on ends stable.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Minimal max stress already achieved; mass somewhat low compared to max 30; increasing cross sections or repositioning nodes might reduce stress but likely increase mass; potential node_4 vertical position adjusting might marginally improve stress but current is reasonable.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Since max stress is about half the allowable stress limit, reducing stress further would require changing geometry or increasing member areas. Increasing area reduces stress but increases mass. Reducing mass not needed. Moving node_4 vertically can shift internal force distribution but with load at node_3 fixed, significant improvement is unlikely. Current design is a good balance.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Area ids used: all \'2\', mass ~13.8; max stress 15.07; no constraints violated; adjustments risk over mass or complexity with little stress gain. Stability and symmetry maintained.",\n\n  "calculation": "No changes in node positions or member areas; existing areas \'2\' optimal given mass margin.
