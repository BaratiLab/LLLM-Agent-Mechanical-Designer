Supports fixed. Current max stress 72.5 > 30, mass 30.9 > 30. Need lighter design and reduce stress by member area and topology change.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure has excessive high compressive stress in member_1 (-72.5) with small area (1). Large member mass (11.28) in member_3 with large area (4). Members around node_3 overloaded. Member connection to node_6 adds mass but does not reduce stress effectively. Node_3 at x=2, y=0 creates long lever arm under diagonal load, causing high compression.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, reduce length or increase area selectively. Current max area is 4 on a few members, but member_1 area=1 too small for heavy compression. Possibly add a new intermediate node near node_3 but higher vertically for linkage, and avoid heavy horizontal members. Reduce large area member_3, and add diagonal ties to transfer load more effectively. Remove node_6 to reduce complexity and mass.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Maintain nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Remove node_6. Reposition node_5 slightly lower to reduce height, move node_4 upward to increase stability and reduce compression in member_1. Add diagonal members from node_5 to node_1 and node_4 to node_2 for better triangulation. Adjust cross-section areas as per stress demand to be <= 30. Use larger areas for highly stressed members, smaller for low stress members. Use areas: member_1 area_id=3 (1.759), member_3 area_id=2(0.782), balancing mass and stress.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Reducing mass from removing node_6 and trimming overly massive members helps meeting mass constraint. Increasing node_4 height and lowering node_5 slightly will improve load distribution improving compression demands on member_1. Adding diagonals creates more effective load paths reducing member stresses. Optimized cross-section areas reduce mass while keeping max stress below 30. Triangulated structure is stable with minimal redundancy.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths for new members and existing with new nodal positions, estimate mass = sum(length*area).
