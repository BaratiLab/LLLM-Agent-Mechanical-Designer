Current max stress 42.18 exceeds 30; total mass 13.2451 well below 30 max. Strategy: reduce stress by better force distribution and area adjustment.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High compressive stress (-42.1791, -40.542) in members connected to node_3 and node_4 suggests load path concentration. Current nodes minimal; adding node(s) to create more triangular substructures to distribute load better is beneficial. Current node_4 at (3.0, 2.0) may be repositioned or supplemented with another node higher or laterally displaced for improved geometry. Member_3 (\'node_1\' to \'node_2\') is only baseline and not stressed highly (-5.9172), can decrease or maintain area for mass savings.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding node between node_3 and node_4 or above node_4, form multiple triangles. Increase areas selectively on highly stressed members, reduce areas for low stress members. Avoid over-areas to keep mass below 30.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add one new node (node_5) at approx (4.0, 2.5) to form more triangular bracing. Connect node_5 with node_4, node_2, and node_3. Remove direct low area member_3 (\'node_1\' to \'node_2\') to reduce bending and stress concentration; replace with two triangle members via node_4 and node_5. Assign areas: higher for members with compression near 30, medium for tension members, minimal for low load members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Introducing node_5 creates additional load path and increases stiffness and stress distribution. Removing direct member_3 reduces bending effects and redistributes forces through triangles. Adjusting areas based on stress magnitudes reduces material usage without violating max stress or mass constraints. Positions chosen maintain original nodes unchanged as per instructions.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Estimate length of members and areas. Use areas from set {0:1,1:0.195,...}.
