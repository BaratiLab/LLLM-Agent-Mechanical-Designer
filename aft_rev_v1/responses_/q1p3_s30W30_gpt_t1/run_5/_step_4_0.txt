  "preamble": "Current truss satisfies constraints with low max stress and moderate mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints max stress Â±30, max mass 30; current max stress 8.31, mass 20.52. Node load and supports fixed at node_3, node_1, node_2.",
  "analysis": "Stress levels are well below allowable limits; mass is 2/3 of max allowed. Structure is statically stable and closed; no overstressed members or members near yielding.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further reducing stress would incur complexity and possibly increase mass; node placement optimized for load path.",
  "reasoning": "Given low max stress and feasible mass, structural performance is efficient. Member areas suitably assigned (mix of area ids 1-3). Efforts to reduce stress further unlikely to give meaningful gains given constraints and iterative improvements history.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Members with stress < 10 and no load/support node moves allowed. Minor height adjustment of node_4 improved load transfer. Member areas chosen to balance mass and strength.",
  "calculation": "Mass 20.522 < 30, max stress 8.31 < 30. All members in tension/compression well below limits. No duplicate nodes/members. Load-support nodes unchanged.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints satisfied, structure closed, no further beneficial modification steps evident. Stop optimization.",
