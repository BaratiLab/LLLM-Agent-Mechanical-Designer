  "preamble": "Optimize a closed 2D truss with given nodes, loads, supports to minimize stress within ±30 and mass ≤ 30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes fixed at node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Load at node_3 downward-left at 45° of magnitude 10. Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Need closed truss (all nodes connected forming at least one closed loop). Max stress ±30, max mass 30 from length×area. Areas discrete set given. Goal: optimize topology and area selection without moving nodes.",

  "analysis": "Current nodes are colinear on x-axis (0,0), (2,0), (6,0). The truss is essentially a line, which cannot be closed. Need at least one additional node off the line to form closed loops. Adding one node is simplest to form a triangle for closed structure. Adding a strategically placed node_4 at (2.0, 2.0) creates a triangle with nodes 1,3,4 and extended to node 2 with members. This yields a minimal closed truss. Load at node_3 (-10 N at -45°) induces bending and tension/compression in members. Supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller provide boundary reaction for static equilibrium.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 2.0). Form members: (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_4), (node_4-node_1) forming triangle. Also connect node_4 to node_2 for stiffness and closure. Possibly connect node_3-node_2 to increase redundancy. Areas assigned based on load path to maintain stresses ≤30. Approximate member forces using static equilibrium with trigonometric method. Calculate member lengths to sum mass = length × area, keep ≤30.",

  "reasoning": "1. Closed truss requires at least 3 nodes not colinear; add node_4 off the line at (2.0, 2.0).\n2. Form triangle node_1, node_3, node_4 carrying primary load transfer.\n3. Connect node_4 to node_2 to form closed quadrilateral and enhance load path.\n4. Connect node_3 to node_2 for stiffness.\n5. Calculate member lengths and assign areas from given discrete set to keep stress in ±30.\n6. Use static equilibrium and simple truss assumptions (axial load only in members).\n7. Areas chosen minimizing mass but sufficient to keep member stress ≤30.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths:\n- node_1-node_3: distance = |0-2|=2.0\n- node_3-node_4: sqrt((2-2)^2+(2-0)^2)=2.0\n- node_4-node_1: sqrt((2-0)^2+(2-0)^2)=2.828\n- node_4-node_2: sqrt((6-2)^2+(0-2)^2)=sqrt(16+4)=4.472\n- node_3-node_2: sqrt((6-2)^2+0)=4.0\n\nAssume member forces F_i identified via static equilibrium resolving loads and reactions; approximate largest forces around 15 units (assuming load magnitudes and paths). Area thresholds to limit stress = Force/Area ≤30 → Area ≥ Force/30.\n\nAssign areas roughly:\n- For force ~15, area ~0.5, pick area_id 2 (0.782).\n- For smaller forces ~7, area 0.3, pick area_id 1 (0.195).\n\nCalculate mass = sum(length × area). Ensure total ≤30.",

  "Member lengths and assumed forces:\n" 
  "L_13=2.0, F_13~10N tensile → area ≥ 10/30=0.333 → pick area_id=2 (0.782)\n"
  "L_34=2.0, F_34~15N compression → area ≥ 15/30=0.5 → area_id=2 (0.782)\n"
  "L_41=2.828, F_41~8N tension → area ≥ 8/30=0.267 → area_id=2 (0.782)\n"
  "L_42=4.472, F_42~7N compression → area ≥ 7/30=0.233 → area_id=1 (0.195) or 2 (0.782) safe to pick 1\n"
  "L_32=4.0, F_32~5N tension → area≥5/30=0.167 → area_id=1(0.195)\n\n"
  "Mass = sum(length * area):\n"
  " = 2*0.782 + 2*0.782 + 2.828*0.782 + 4.472*0.195 + 4*0.195\n"
