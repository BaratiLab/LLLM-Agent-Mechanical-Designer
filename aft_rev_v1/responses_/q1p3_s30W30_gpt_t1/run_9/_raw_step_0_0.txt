Goal: optimize topology and area selection without moving nodes.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current nodes are colinear on x-axis (0,0), (2,0), (6,0). The truss is essentially a line, which cannot be closed. Need at least one additional node off the line to form closed loops. Adding one node is simplest to form a triangle for closed structure. Adding a strategically placed node_4 at (2.0, 2.0) creates a triangle with nodes 1,3,4 and extended to node 2 with members. This yields a minimal closed truss. Load at node_3 (-10 N at -45°) induces bending and tension/compression in members.
