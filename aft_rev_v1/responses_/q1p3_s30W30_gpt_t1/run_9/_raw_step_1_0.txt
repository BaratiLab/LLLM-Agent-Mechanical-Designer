Mass 6.9919 < 30 allowed max. Load at node_3, fixed supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller).",\n\n  "analysis": "Max stress mainly in member_4 (27.028, tension) and member_5 (-24.1746, compression). Members 4 and 5 connect loaded node_4 and node_3 to support node_2. Node_3 is free along x=2 but on baseline x=2. Node_4 can be moved along y-axis only per constraints (fixed x=2 is not specified, so only nodes with load/support fixed, i.e. node_1 and node_2 fixed, nodes 3 and 4 can move except node_3 is load node). Given instruction to not move load/support nodes, node_3 cannot be moved, but node_4 can move freely. Current design is closed truss: node_1-node_3-node_4-node_1 triangle plus members connecting to node_2. We aim to reduce high tensile stress in member_4 by improving geometry to decrease load intensity there.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_4 is short, so stress is high. We can move node_4 up or sideways (only y) to reduce tension in member_4 by increasing its length and reducing force concentration. Member_5 has compression but less critical. Also, can modify cross-section areas for members 4 and 5 to optimize stresses. Current member area: member_4 = 1, member_5 =1 (smallest). Increasing member_4 area reduces stress. We\'ll increase area to reduce max stress and slightly move node_4 vertically to lengthen member_4.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Keep nodes 1, 2, 3 fixed (load/support). Move node_4 vertically upward to increase length of member_4 and member_2 to reduce stress concentration. Increase cross-sectional area for member_4 and member_5 to reduce stress levels, selecting from area sizing lookup. Current areas: member_4 and 5 areas = 1 (0.195). Increase member_4 to area=3 (1.759) and member_5 to area=2 (0.782) to balance mass and stress reduction. Members 1, 2, 3 stay at area=2 (0.782). Check resulting total mass still < 30. This adjustment should reduce max stress under 27 MPa, closer to 20 MPa maximum.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: member_4 length = distance node_4 (2, y_4) to node_2(6,0) = sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0 - y_4)^2) = sqrt(16 + y_4^2). Increase y4 to increase length. Member_5 length = node_3 (2,0) to node_2 (6,0) = 4. Member_2 length = node_3(2,0) to node_4(2, y4) = y_4. Member_1 length=distance node_1(0,0) to node_3(2,0)=2. Member_3 length=distance node_4(2,y4) to node_1(0,0)= sqrt(4 + y4^2). With current y_4=2, we have those values; we will increase y4 from 2 to 3.5 to lengthen members 4 and 2 significantly.",\n\n  "calculation": "New node_4 = (2.0, 3.5). Member lengths update: member_4 length = sqrt(16 + 3.5^2) = sqrt(16 + 12.25) = sqrt(28.25) ≈ 5.315, member_2 length = 3.5, member_3 length = sqrt(4 + 12.25) = sqrt(16.25) ≈ 4.031. Assume max stress in members proportional to force/area/length, increasing length and area reduces stress. Mass recalculation: sum over members length × area. Using area_ids: member_1: 2(0.782), length 2.0 → 1.564; member_2: 2(0.782), length 3.5 → 2.737; member_3: 2(0.782), length 4.031 → 3.153; member_4: 3(1.759), length 5.315 → 9.348; member_5: 2(0.782), length 4 → 3.128_mass. Total mass = 1.564+2.737+3.153+9.348+3.128=19.93 < 30 (allowed).
