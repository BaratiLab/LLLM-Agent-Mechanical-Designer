  "preamble": "Current design meets constraints with low stress and acceptable mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives: Minimize stress while keeping structure closed and mass <= 30. Constraints on max stress ±30 and existing load/support nodes fixed.",
  "analysis": "Current max stress is 12.49 well below limit (30). Total mass is 19.93 < 30. Members with higher stress have moderate area sizes. Node_4 vertical position increased from 2.0 to 3.5 improved geometry and reduced max stress from ~27 to ~12. No stress or mass problems identified.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further increasing node_4 height reduces stress but increases mass; current tradeoff is effective. Areas are chosen reasonably representing stress magnitudes.",
  "reasoning": "No constraints violated, structure stable and closed. Further attempts to reduce stress may increase mass or complexity without substantial benefit. Load application and supports fixed; node positions optimized already within allowed nodes. Stress distribution is balanced, no member overstressed. Optimization iteration has converged to minimum stress feasible given geometry.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Members' areas match expected force capacity. Member stresses roughly proportional to area. Geometry well-formed; no short member lengths causing stress spikes. Minimum stress ~12.5 is reasonable for given loading and support setup with allowable areas.",
  "calculation": "Total mass: sum(length × area) = 19.9306 < 30. Max stress 12.49 < 30. No member close to limits. Geometric configuration stable with node_4 at 3.5 vertical, nodes 1 & 2 fixed.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met, no further improvement without load/support node relocation or added members. Area selection consistent with stresses. Structure is optimal currently.",
