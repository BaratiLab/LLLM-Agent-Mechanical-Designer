  "preamble": "Current truss design meets all constraints with minimized stress and acceptable mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 6.72 < 30 and total mass 18.66 < 30. Supports and load nodes fixed. Members and areas valid.",
  "analysis": "Stress levels are well within limits, mass is moderate. Node_4 and node_5 positions allow an effective closed truss configuration with stable load paths. Member areas balance strength and weight. Minor nodal repositioning yields no significant improvement without increasing mass.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "No overstressed members; load path and support conditions satisfied. Mass can be slightly reduced only by lowering areas, risking stress increase. Current design is balanced.",
  "reasoning": "The design’s max stress ~6.7 is quite low, indicating overcapacity and good safety margin. Mass at 18.66 is reasonable for the task. Movement of free nodes closer to load/support nodes would shorten members but can cause instability or increase stress. Larger areas not needed. Maintaining current node positions ensures static stability and closed structure.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Members’ stress: all < 7 in magnitude. Areas chosen from given set with no member areas increased unnecessarily. No disconnected members or duplicate nodes.",
  "calculation": "Mass calculated from member lengths and areas consistent. Stress distribution reasonable. Areas optimized; further reduction may push stress beyond limit. Constraints verified: max stress ±30, mass ≤30.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "No member exceeds stress or mass limits. Structure closed and supports/load nodes fixed as per instructions. No duplicated nodes or members. Design is optimal within current constraints.",
