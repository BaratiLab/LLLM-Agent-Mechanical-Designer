Nodes for loads/support fixed. Need to reduce stress and evenly distribute forces.",\n  "analysis": "Max stress comes from member_5 (-19.116), member_3 (-16.3313), and member_7 (17.9503). Member areas are small for high stress members (1 for member_5, 2 for member_3 & member_7). Increasing cross sectional area can reduce stress. Node_6 position near load can be slightly adjusted keeping load/support nodes fixed to optimize force flow. Member_5 very critical, maybe increase its area. Current layout is stable with five nodes and closed shape, adding members risks complexity.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Improving stress by increasing area of high stress members is viable. Carefully shift node_6 slightly along line between node_4 and node_2 or slightly down to better distribute load paths. Maintain member_5 length short to have effective force distribution.",\n  "reasoning": "Increasing area of members with near-limit stress reduces stress by increasing load-bearing capacity. Minor vertical adjustment of node_6 can change force directions and reduce peak stress. Keep node_3 fixed due to load; node_4 fixed at moderate height and location. Avoid adding members to keep simple truss. Increase member_5 area from \'1\' to \'2\' or \'3\'. Increase member_3 and member_7 area from \'2\' to \'3\' or \'4\'.

Node_6 move from (4.2, 2.0) to approximately (4.1, 1.8) to reduce bending moment effects while keeping connections intact.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: member_3 length approx 1.58; member_5 approx 2.49; member_7 approx 3.54.
