Mass is main failure. Member areas: highest in members 2,7 and 3. Member 7 mass 7.57 area 3. Previously, member areas mostly 2 or 3, some 1. Need mass reduction mainly in members with large areas or length. No node repositioning for 1,2,3. Node_4 and 6 can be adjusted or possibly reduce member count or areas. Current topology has 7 members; maybe reduce to 6, simplify. Stress distribution low enough to lower areas safely. Areas can be decreased at members with low stresses.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce member areas especially members 2 and 7. Try reducing member_7 area from \'3\' to \'1\' (big mass reduction). Check members 4 and 5. Member 5 area 2 can be lowered to 1. Node_6 can slightly reposition for shorter members, e.g. move closer to line node_3 to node_2, reduce member length. Node_4 can be slightly adjusted downwards to reduce member lengths. Remove member_6 (node_1-node_4) to reduce mass if truss remains stable. Check stability with members 1,2,3,4 and 5,7.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Keep nodes_1,2,3 fixed; reposition node_4 to (3.3,3.2) to shorten members; move node_6 to (4.0,1.5) reducing length of members connected. Remove member_6 (node_1-node_4) to save mass. Reduce areas of members as: member_1=\'2\', member_2=\'2\', member_3=\'1\', member_4=\'2\', member_5=\'1\', member_7=\'1\'. This simplifies structure, reduces mass and keeps stresses within limits.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Removing member_6 reduces one member and its mass. Supports and load nodes unchanged. Reducing areas on low-stress members reduces mass efficiently. Adjusting node_4 and node_6 positions shortens member lengths, reduces member mass. Member 7 area reduced from 3 to 1 significantly reduces mass. Member 3 reduces area to 1 saves mass safely as stress low. This will keep structure stable and within constraints.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Mass estimates: member lengths approx: 1->3=2m,3->4=~2,4->6=~2,6->2=~2,3->6=~2,2->4=~3.
