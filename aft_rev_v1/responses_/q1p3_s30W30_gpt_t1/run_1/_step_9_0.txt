  "preamble": "Optimizing current 2D truss to minimize stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 8.93 well below ±30; mass 21.4861 below max 30. Load at node_3; supports fixed. Node_3 and nodes 1,2 fixed positions.",
  "analysis": "Max stress low, mass moderate; potential to reduce max stress further by improving load path and geometry. Current geometry has node_5 close to load, but member_5 zero stress suggests inefficient force transfer. Node_4 and node_5 can be repositioned. Members use moderate area sections (2=0.782,3=1.759). Members with compressive stress up to -8.927; tensile up to 7.485. Load path from node_3 to supports via node_4 and node_5 can be optimized.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Adjust node_4 and node_5 to improve load transfer, possibly move node_5 slightly closer to node_2 horizontally to better align members reducing bending. Use smaller cross section for members under low stress (e.g. member_5 zero stress can downgrade area). Increase area in critical members (member_2, member_6) safely if needed to further reduce stress.",
  "reasoning": "1) Keep fixed node_1, node_2, node_3. 2) Move node_4 slightly left and downward to reduce compressive stress on member_2 and improve force triangulation. 3) Move node_5 slightly horizontally and vertically to better align with load vector and support node_2, enhancing triangulation and reducing bending. 4) Decrease area of member_5 from '3' (1.759) to '2' (0.782) since stress zero. 5) Keep member_1 and member_4 at area '3' or slightly reduced if stress low. 6) Areas selected to ensure mass under 30.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Distances: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Current node_4(3.0,3.0), node_5(4.5,1.5). Move node_4 to ~ (2.7,2.5). Move node_5 to ~ (4.8,1.2). Calculate resulting member lengths. Check that member length × area sums mass<30. Current total mass 21.4861; small area changes maintain margin.",
  "calculation": "Updated node positions: node_4: (2.7,2.5), node_5: (4.8,1.2). Adjust member_5 area from '3' to '2'. Member connections unchanged. Estimated member lengths shorten member_2 and member_6 lengths slightly, reducing compressive forces. Member_5 area reduction reduces mass without adding stress. Total estimated mass around 20.5-21. Measure max stress expected to maintain <9 via better force path.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no overlap or duplicate nodes/members. Node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Triangulation maintained with 6 members. Mass and stress constraints satisfied. This incremental improvement can reduce max stress further while keeping mass margin. Continue optimization in next iterations.",
