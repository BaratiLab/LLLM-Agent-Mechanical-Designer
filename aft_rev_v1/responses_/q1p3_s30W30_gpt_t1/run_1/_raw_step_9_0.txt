Load at node_3; supports fixed. Node_3 and nodes 1,2 fixed positions.",\n  "analysis": "Max stress low, mass moderate; potential to reduce max stress further by improving load path and geometry. Current geometry has node_5 close to load, but member_5 zero stress suggests inefficient force transfer. Node_4 and node_5 can be repositioned. Members use moderate area sections (2=0.782,3=1.759). Members with compressive stress up to -8.927; tensile up to 7.485. Load path from node_3 to supports via node_4 and node_5 can be optimized.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adjust node_4 and node_5 to improve load transfer, possibly move node_5 slightly closer to node_2 horizontally to better align members reducing bending. Use smaller cross section for members under low stress (e.g. member_5 zero stress can downgrade area). Increase area in critical members (member_2, member_6) safely if needed to further reduce stress.",\n  "reasoning": "1) Keep fixed node_1, node_2, node_3. 2) Move node_4 slightly left and downward to reduce compressive stress on member_2 and improve force triangulation. 3) Move node_5 slightly horizontally and vertically to better align with load vector and support node_2, enhancing triangulation and reducing bending. 4) Decrease area of member_5 from \'3\' (1.759) to \'2\' (0.782) since stress zero. 5) Keep member_1 and member_4 at area \'3\' or slightly reduced if stress low. 6) Areas selected to ensure mass under 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Distances: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0).
