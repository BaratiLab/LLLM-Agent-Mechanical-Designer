  "preamble": "Optimize truss nodes (except supports/loads) to reduce max stress under constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: reduce max stress (currently 10.6) under ±30 limit and total mass ≤30. Current mass is 17.79, well below max. Nodes node_1 and node_2 fixed, load on node_3 fixed. We can move node_4 and node_5 for optimization. Areas are set as '3' or '2' mostly; focus on geometry improvements first.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress 10.6 is acceptable, but member_3 (node_4-node_2) is highest tensile stress, and member_1 (node_1-node_3) highest compression. Node_4 y=2.25 and x=2.7, node_5 at (4.9, 1.0) seem suboptimal. Increasing height of node_4 may reduce stress in member_3 by distributing load better. Minor adjustment on node_5 position could improve force paths. Member areas look balanced; geometry optimization preferred over area to reduce mass increase risk.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Strategy: raise node_4 vertically to around 2.75–3.0 to reduce tension in member_3, maybe slightly move node_5 closer to line node_4-node_2 to better align members and reduce bending stress. Keep lengths reasonable to avoid mass increase. Keep areas same as current to keep mass same or improved.",
  
  "reasoning": "Increasing y of node_4 redistributes force in members 2 and 3. It reduces tension in member_3. Moving node_5 slightly lower and slightly left, closer to node_4-node_2 line, straightens members 4 and 5, possibly reducing stress in member_4 and zero stress on member_5 now may have some tensile sharing. Areas kept '2' for members connected to node_4 and node_2, and '3' for members connected to node_1 and node_3 as current to keep mass low. No new members added to avoid mass increase. Node_3 at (2,0) fixed due to load.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approximated: node_4-node_2 (~3.3 length). Increasing node_4 y from 2.25 to 2.8 raises length to ~3.64, slight mass increase but better force distribution expected. Node_5 moved from (4.9,1.0) to (4.7,1.1) to align better, improving force path. Current member areas adequate to handle stresses below ±30. Total mass should remain ~18 or less.",
  
  "calculation": "New node_4: (2.7, 2.8). Distance node_4-node_2: sqrt((6-2.7)^2 + (0-2.8)^2) ≈ sqrt(3.3^2+2.8^2)=sqrt(10.89+7.84)=sqrt(18.73)=4.33 units. Old was ~3.3 units, length increase ~30%. Area remains '2' (0.782), mass ~ length×area. Small mass increase expected but still below 30. Node_5 from (4.9, 1.0) to (4.7, 1.1) reduces length for member_5 slightly, reducing zero stress member mass. Node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Updated geometry preserves the closed truss shape, no duplicate nodes/members. Member areas unchanged to maintain allowable stresses below ±30. Mass remains below 30. Improvements expected in max stress reduction below 10. Current max stress 10.6 is modest, should reduce with changes. Iterations remain to refine, so stop=False.",
