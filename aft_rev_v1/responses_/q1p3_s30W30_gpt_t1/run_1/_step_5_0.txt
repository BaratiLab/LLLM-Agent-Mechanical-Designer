  "preamble": "Optimize current truss to reduce max stress while maintaining constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current structure has max stress 19.12 within Â±30 limit, total mass 24.06 below max 30. Nodes for loads/support fixed. Need to reduce stress and evenly distribute forces.",
  "analysis": "Max stress comes from member_5 (-19.116), member_3 (-16.3313), and member_7 (17.9503). Member areas are small for high stress members (1 for member_5, 2 for member_3 & member_7). Increasing cross sectional area can reduce stress. Node_6 position near load can be slightly adjusted keeping load/support nodes fixed to optimize force flow. Member_5 very critical, maybe increase its area. Current layout is stable with five nodes and closed shape, adding members risks complexity.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Improving stress by increasing area of high stress members is viable. Carefully shift node_6 slightly along line between node_4 and node_2 or slightly down to better distribute load paths. Maintain member_5 length short to have effective force distribution.",
  "reasoning": "Increasing area of members with near-limit stress reduces stress by increasing load-bearing capacity. Minor vertical adjustment of node_6 can change force directions and reduce peak stress. Keep node_3 fixed due to load; node_4 fixed at moderate height and location. Avoid adding members to keep simple truss. Increase member_5 area from '1' to '2' or '3'. Increase member_3 and member_7 area from '2' to '3' or '4'. Balance overall mass increase to stay below 30. Node_6 move from (4.2, 2.0) to approximately (4.1, 1.8) to reduce bending moment effects while keeping connections intact.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: member_3 length approx 1.58; member_5 approx 2.49; member_7 approx 3.54. New area choices: member_3 and member_7 from 2(0.782) to 3(1.759), member_5 from 1(0.195) to 3(1.759). Mass increase: member_3 from 1.294 to ~2.9 (+1.6), member_7 from 3.3635 to ~7.6 (+4.2), member_5 from 0.58 to ~5.1 (+4.5). Total mass rises by ~10.3 to ~34.4 > 30 max, need less aggressive area increase.",
  "calculation": "Reduce area choice to member_3 and member_7 from 2 to 3 and member_5 from 1 to 2: member_5 from 0.58 to ~0.58/0.195*0.782= ~2.32, mass increase ~1.7; member_3 and member_7 from 1.294 and 3.3635 to ~1.294/0.782*1.759=~2.9, increase each ~1.6; total increase ~4.9, total mass = 24.06 + 4.9= 28.96 < 30 max. Acceptable.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Move node_6 from (4.2, 2.0) to (4.1, 1.8). Increase member_5 area to '2', member_3 and member_7 to '3' to reduce stress below current max 19.12 and stay within mass 30. Keep other members unchanged.",
