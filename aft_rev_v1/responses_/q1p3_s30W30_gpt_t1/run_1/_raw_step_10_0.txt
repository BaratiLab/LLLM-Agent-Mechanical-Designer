Current max stress ~10.07, mass 18.35. Load applied on node_3 only. Supports fixed (node_1 pinned, node_2 roller). Member areas mostly 2 or 3. Node_1 and node_2 fixed, others can move. Aim to reduce member_6 stress slightly at node_1-node_4 link. Structure closed with 6 members.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress is close to 10, well below limit 30 but can be reduced. Member_6 (node_1-node_4) has highest tensile stress ~10.07. Slight adjustments of node_4 position can improve force path and reduce stress in member_6. Node_5 position can be adjusted to share load better between members 4 and 5. Member areas appear effective; keeping them or reducing some to save mass might help if stress allows. Total mass is 18.35 well under 30, so some increase for better shape allowed. No members > area_id 3 currently, so further increase might be limited or unnecessary considering mass budget. Use precise floats for node moves. Moves must not violate nodes for loads/support. Current stress distribution shows compressive and tensile balanced.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider lowering node_4 y slightly and shifting node_5 right/down a bit to better triangulate and transfer load from node_3.

Node_5 current (4.8, 1.2) can be moved slightly closer to node_2 on x-axis and slightly lower to optimize load path from node_3. Member 4 area 3 can be maintained to ensure strength. Member 5 area 2 may be slightly increased to 3 if needed, but first try geometry moves. Member_6 area 2 kept as is for mass.
