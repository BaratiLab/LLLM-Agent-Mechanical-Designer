  "preamble": "Redesign truss to satisfy max stress ±30 and mass ≤30 under given load, supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 downward-left (-10 N, 45°), supports fixed at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Current max stress highly exceeded in members (±>70). Mass is low but stresses violate constraints.",
  
  "analysis": "Current structure uses shorter members with small area but fails stress limits primarily in member_3 and member_7. Member_3 (node_4-node_6) is tensile at 76.77 and member_7 (node_2-node_4) compressive at -71.13, both above ±30 limit. Member areas for these members are too small (area_id '1' = 0.195) leading to overstress. Mass is low (7.88) but stresses too large. Geometry with node_4 and node_6 makes a small triangle, stress concentrates there.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, increase cross-sectional area in critical members and improve load transfer. Possibly add or reposition intermediate nodes for better force distribution. Avoid overly small area members for loaded diagonals. Use larger area for compression and tension critical members. Keep load/support nodes fixed. Try increasing node_4 height to spread load, and node_6 position for force equilibrium. Add a member between node_1 and node_6 to better triangulate and share load. Use areas up to '4' (3.128) to handle stresses within ±30.",
  
  "proposal": "Add member node_1-node_6 with moderate area to improve bracing. Increase area in members node_4-node_6 and node_2-node_4 from '1' to '4' to reduce stress below 30. Slightly move node_4 higher to (3.3, 3.8) for better load path; keep node_6 near (4.0, 1.5). Maintain members from previous iteration except add node_1-node_6. Assign cross-section areas as follows: node_1-node_3: 2 (0.782), node_3-node_4: 2 (0.782), node_4-node_6: 4 (3.128), node_6-node_2: 2 (0.782), node_3-node_6: 1 (0.195), node_2-node_4: 4 (3.128), node_1-node_6: 3 (1.759). This triangulation distributes load efficiently.",
  
  "reasoning": "Adding node_1-node_6 member improves lateral bracing, reducing bending on other members. Increasing cross-section areas on high stress members reduces the stress (stress ∝ 1/area). Raising node_4 slightly improves vertical force resolution. Areas kept as low as possible to minimize mass while meeting stress constraints. The new member helps better load sharing. Total mass expected < 30. Proposed areas align with allowable cross-section dictionary.\n",
