Total mass ≤ 30. Current max stress 38.75 > 30. Mass 12.16 < 30, so focus on stress reduction mainly.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has member_1 (node_1-node_3) overstressed in compression at -38.75 with area = 0.195. Load applied at node_3 down-left at 45°. Node_4 slightly moved upward to 3.4m increases stresses on member_1. Members 4,5,6 link node_4, redistributing forces. To reduce member_1 stress, increase its area or reduce load path through it. Current areas are small (mostly area=1 or 2 - i.e. 0.195 or 0.782). Some members have small area but moderate stress compression or tension. Mass under limit, so we may increase areas carefully or add members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 compressive overstress is critical. Could increase its cross-sectional area or introduce additional node(s) mid-span to reduce force or add diagonal bracing. Keep node_1 and node_2 supports unchanged. Load at node_3 fixed. Adjust node_4 to redistribute load path. Could add one node between node_1 and node_3 or near node_3 on vertical to relieve compression. Select areas from given discrete set. Aim to balance members stresses ≤ ±30 and keep mass ≤ 30.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 near node_3 vertically above (e.g., 2.0, 1.8) to form a 2-level truss, adding members node_3-node_5, node_4-node_5, node_1-node_5, node_2-node_5 with suitable area to share load. Increase area of member_1 to area_id=2 (0.782) to reduce stress. Reassign areas on other critical members (e.g. members from node_4) to reduce stress concentration. This reduces compressive stress on member_1 and yields better load distribution.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "The initial compressive stress exceeded limit on member_1, with the smallest area causing it. Increasing area lowers stress as stress inversely proportional to area for a given force. By adding node_5 at (2.0, 1.8), near node_3 vertically upwards, the structure gains alternate load paths. Members connecting node_5 to node_1, node_2, node_4 and node_3 allow load redistribution. This reduces load on member_1 and associated compressive stress. Increasing areas on load carrying members further reduces stress. Total mass remains under 30 as area increases balanced with additional members of smaller lengths.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculations: \\n- node_1(0,0) to node_3(2,0): length=2m\\n- node_3(2,0) to node_5(2,1.8): length=1.8m\\n- node_5(2,1.8) to node_4(2.2,3.4): length approx sqrt((0.2)^2+ (1.6)^2)=1.612\\n- node_5 to node_1 length=√(2^2+1.8^2)=2.69\\n- node_5 to node_2(6,0): length=~4.47\\nUse area_id=2 (0.782) or 3 (1.759) for members with higher load and lower for others.
