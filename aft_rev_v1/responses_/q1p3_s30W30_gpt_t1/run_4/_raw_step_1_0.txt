Current max stress 26.99 close to limit, mass 20.8 under limit. Load at node_3 fixed; supports fixed. Current high stress in member_2 (-26.99), area=0.195 likely too small; mass of member_1 (area 1.759) high. Current geometry has node_4 at (2,3).",\n  "analysis": "Member_2 (node_1-node_3) has max compressive stress near limit. Members 4,5,6 connecting node_4 are moderate stress; node_4 position affects load distribution on those members reducing loading on member_2. Moving node_4 upward or slightly right could better triangulate forces. Smaller area for high load members reduces mass but can increase stress beyond limit; better to redistribute stresses via geometry. Reduce member_1 area if stress low (member_1 current stress -2.8), possibly area=1 instead of 3.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Move node_4 to (2.2, 3.4) to redistribute load, increase member_4 and 5 length and angle to reduce stress on member_2. Adjust area of member_1 from \'3\' (1.759) to \'1\' (0.195). Keep member_2 area same initially, may increase if stress not improved. Small increase to node_4 x,y to improve truss angle and load flow.",\n  "reasoning": "Load path improvement by shifting node_4 right and up improves force triangulation reducing stress on member_2. Reducing member_1 area reduces mass significantly, member stress on member_1 is low enough. Member_6 and others remain same area to maintain structure.
