  "preamble": "Current 6-node truss satisfies constraints with low max stress and moderate mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 13.21 within Â±30 limit. Mass 19.59 well below 30. Load at node_3; supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2; nodes_1,2,3 fixed. Added nodes_5 and 6 to refine stress distribution.",
  "analysis": "Current design achieves low max stress (13.21) far below allowable 30 with total mass ~19.59. Member areas and node placements create balanced stress distribution around the load node_3.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "History shows prior high stress problems reduced by adding nodes and adjusting member areas; iteration 5 is best so far.",
  "reasoning": "Reducing member area for high-stress members risks increasing stress; increasing area increases mass beyond limit. Node repositioning options limited by fixed supports and load node. Present design well-balanced.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress minimized by adding nodes near load and redistributing member stiffness. Further node movements risk losing closed truss or increasing stress due to geometric constraints.",
  "calculation": "No nodes at load/support moved. Node_5 and node_6 placed to form triangular elements with adequate length and orientation to reduce stress concentrations; member_1 and 5 have largest areas to resist compression/tension. Mass calculation confirms total under limit.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Preserved node locations at load and supports. Structure closed with no duplicate members or nodes. All areas chosen from given set. Max stress and mass constraints fully satisfied.",
