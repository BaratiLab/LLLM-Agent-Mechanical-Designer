    "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to meet max stress ±30 and mass ≤30 with given loads and supports.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 is -10N at -45°. Supports are at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller). Load and support nodes fixed. Current max stress is 36.32 > 30 limit, total mass 11.99 < 30. Need to reduce max stress, mainly member_5 with -36.32 stress. Areas currently between 0.195 and 0.782 mostly.",
    
    "analysis": "High compressive stress on member_5 from node_3 to node_4 (-36.32) indicates overloading. Member_5 has area_id '1' (0.195 area). Increasing cross-section area there reduces stress, but increases mass. Current design has too small an area in some key members. Geometry can be adjusted, adding a node to better distribute forces. Node_5 was moved from (1.95,2.0) to (3.0,3.0) but did not reduce max stress below limit. Propose moving node_5 closer to node_4 to better triangulate and add a new node to increase stiffness. Consider increasing cross-sectional areas of highly stressed members. Keep total mass below 30 (currently 11.99).",
    "scratch_pad_2": "Must prevent duplicate node or member; must keep nodes for support and load fixed; limited area options for members. Consider adding a new node above node_5 position for more load path. Use bigger area for member_5 and reduce other less stressed member areas to compensate mass. Retain triangular shapes for stability.",
    
    "proposal": "Modify node_5 position to (2.6, 2.6) to tighten truss near node_4 and add one new node_6 at (3.7, 2.9). Members connect node_3-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_5-node_6, node_6-node_4, node_6-node_2 with optimized areas. Increase area of member_5 from '1' to '3' to reduce stress. Reduce areas of less stressed members like member_6 and member_7 to '0' area (1) or '1' area to save mass. Remove member from node_1 to node_5 if possible to reduce redundancy and mass. Also increase area of member_1 to '3' to help stresses from node_1-node_3. Design matrix approach for member areas and geometry to meet constraints.",
    
    "reasoning": "Stress in member_5 is highest compressive, increase area from 0.195 to 1.759 reduces stress about 9x. Moving node_5 closer to node_4 reduces member lengths and improves force distribution. New node_6 adds more load path and stiffens truss. Reducing some member areas compensates mass increase from bigger areas. Keep overall mass under 30. Maintain triangular panels for stability.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approx calculated via distance formula. Areas used directly from given options. Stress roughly inversely proportional to area. Mass proportional to length times area. Balance between increased area in key members and decreased area in less highly stressed members ensures constraints met. Node coordinates chosen to maintain good angles (not too flat).",
    
    "calculation": "Member 5 length from node_3 (2,0) to node_4 (2.2,3.4) is ~3.4m, with area 0.195 mass is 0.66, stress -36.32. Increase area to 1.759 (9x area) expected stress ~ -4, mass ~ 0.66*9=~6. Precise mass = length*area. Similar reductions by optimizing other members areas. Adjust lengths for new nodes. Estimated total mass ~ 20 (still under 30). Max stress expected below 30.",
    "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes or members, support and load nodes unchanged, member areas only from allowed set, mass under 30, max stress within ±30, no oversizing or undersizing. Respond with final node and member dicts.",
