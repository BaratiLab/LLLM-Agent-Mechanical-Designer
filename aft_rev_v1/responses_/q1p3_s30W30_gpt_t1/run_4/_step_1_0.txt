  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress and mass within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives: minimize max stress ≤ ±30; total mass ≤30. Current max stress 26.99 close to limit, mass 20.8 under limit. Load at node_3 fixed; supports fixed. Current high stress in member_2 (-26.99), area=0.195 likely too small; mass of member_1 (area 1.759) high. Current geometry has node_4 at (2,3).",
  "analysis": "Member_2 (node_1-node_3) has max compressive stress near limit. Members 4,5,6 connecting node_4 are moderate stress; node_4 position affects load distribution on those members reducing loading on member_2. Moving node_4 upward or slightly right could better triangulate forces. Smaller area for high load members reduces mass but can increase stress beyond limit; better to redistribute stresses via geometry. Reduce member_1 area if stress low (member_1 current stress -2.8), possibly area=1 instead of 3.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Move node_4 to (2.2, 3.4) to redistribute load, increase member_4 and 5 length and angle to reduce stress on member_2. Adjust area of member_1 from '3' (1.759) to '1' (0.195). Keep member_2 area same initially, may increase if stress not improved. Small increase to node_4 x,y to improve truss angle and load flow.",
  "reasoning": "Load path improvement by shifting node_4 right and up improves force triangulation reducing stress on member_2. Reducing member_1 area reduces mass significantly, member stress on member_1 is low enough. Member_6 and others remain same area to maintain structure. Aim to reduce mass closer to 18-19 but keep max stress ≤ 30. Keeping all other nodes fixed. Closed truss confirmed by member connectivity remains same.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "New node_4: (2.2, 3.4). Adjust member_1 area to '1' (0.195). Members: member_1: ['node_1','node_3','1'], others unchanged areas except minor recheck if needed. Estimate new member lengths and masses:\nmember_1 length ~ distance node_1(0,0) to node_3(2,0) = 2.0\nmember_2 length =2.0 (node_3 to node_2(6,0))\nmember_4 length ~ sqrt((2.2-0)^2 + (3.4-0)^2)=~4.04\nmember_5 length ~ sqrt((6-2.2)^2 + (0-3.4)^2)=~5.07\nmember_6 length ~ sqrt((2.2-2)^2+(3.4-0)^2)=~3.4\nMass estimate with new areas and lengths should keep total <30. Stress reduction expected from geometry improvement.",
  "calculation": "Member masses recalculated:\nMember_1: length 2 * area 0.195=0.39 (was 10.554)\nMember_2: length 4 * area 0.195=0.78\nMember_3: length ~4 * area 0.195=0.78\nMember_4: length 4.04 * area 0.782=3.16\nMember_5: length 5.07 * area 0.782=3.97\nMember_6: length 3.4 * area 0.782=2.66\nSum mass ~0.39+0.78+0.78+3.16+3.97+2.66=11.74 well below 30\nExpected max stress reduced due to better geometry and members sizes.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved to (2.2, 3.4), member_1 area reduced to '1'. All others same. Mass well under limit, stress expected less than previous max 26.99. Load and support points unchanged. Closed truss maintained with existing 6 members. Stop false to allow further iterations if needed.",
