Mass 8.0076 << 30 excellent. Load on node_3 fixed. Supports fixed. Node_5 introduced in iteration 2 improved mass and stress.",\n  "analysis": "Member_7 stress (-20.85) tension near max tensile limit, member_4 (17.92) also high tension. Node_5 placed near vertical center to distribute forces but member stresses still uneven. Areas mostly \'1\', member_1 area \'2\' (0.782) helps reduce stress there. Small member areas elsewhere keep mass low.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Moving node_5 slightly upward or left might better distribute load. Adjust areas on high stress members to slightly larger area to reduce stress, especially member_7 and member_4. Possibly reduce member_1 area to save weight, compensating stress elsewhere. Keep closed truss with current nodes and pairs.",\n  "reasoning": "To minimize max stress while keeping mass low, redistribute internal node_5 to optimize force flow. Increasing areas on highest stress members decreases stress, but adds mass. Since mass is well below limit (8 vs 30), increasing some member areas is feasible. Shifting node_5 upward ~1.9 to 2.0 might relieve member_7 tension while balancing stresses in member_4 and member_6. Member_1 area could be slightly reduced from \'2\' to \'1\' (0.195) to save mass, redistributing stress. Members connected to load node_3 should have sufficient area for tensile force. Member_7 is critical since it sustains highest tension, increase area to \'2\' (0.782) or possibly \'3\' (1.759) to reduce stress safely.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Current mass 8.0076. Increasing member_7 area from 1 to 3 increases its mass from 0.351 to ~0.78*length but length is ~0.39 (from member_7 mass 0.351 / 1 = 0.351 length*area=mass, length~0.351). So mass increase about 0.4 for member_7. Reducing member_1 from 2 to 1 reduces its mass from 1.56 to ~0.39, saving ~1.17 mass. Net reduction about 0.77 total mass, potential margin to increase member_4 or others slightly if needed.",\n  "calculation": "Shift node_5 from (2.0,1.8) to (1.95,2.0) to relieve tension in member_7. Reduce member_1 area from \'2\' to \'1\'. Increase member_7 area to \'3\'. Keep others at \'1\'. Total mass still well below 30. Expect max stress < 20.85 due to increased area and optimized node. Structure remains closed with current connections.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no node moves load/support nodes (node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed). Node_5 moved within constraint.
