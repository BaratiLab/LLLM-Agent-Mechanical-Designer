  "stop": "True",
  "preamble": "Current design meets constraints with max stress just under limits and mass acceptable.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 28.39 < 30, total mass 20.53 < 30, stresses well controlled, no overload. Load on node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 and node_6 elevated to carry load efficiently.",
  
  "analysis": "All stress values are within ±30 MPa, with max compression member_6 at -28.3873. Mass is below 30 allowed. Node positions for load/support nodes are fixed, internal nodes moved to optimize load path. Members sized variably, smaller sections on high-stress members which is effective. Structure is closed and stable.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further reducing stresses would require either adding more members or changing geometry beyond load/support nodes. Current member areas seem balanced. Smallest tension/compression in member_2 and member_3 shows good distribution.",
  
  "reasoning": "Minimizing stress further by reducing member area risks exceeding stresses due to less cross section. Increasing areas would increase mass beyond limits. Node movements are constrained, load position fixed. Member_6 near max compression stress; reducing its length or increasing area would raise mass or break topology constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member_6 length from (2,0) to (4,2.9) approx √(2²+2.9²)=3.53, minimal length for load transfer from node_3 to node_6. Other members balanced around load and support.",
  
  "calculation": "Total mass = 20.5347 < 30. Max stress = 28.39 < 30. Stress distribution is balanced. Node_3 (load) at x=2 fixed. Node_1 and node_2 supports fixed. Node_4 and node_6 adjusted to optimize force transfer with minimal mass. No further node movements yield better stress vs mass compromise.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Design is optimal under given movement and sizing constraints. Stresses and mass within limits. No further improvements without new members or changes to load/supports.",
