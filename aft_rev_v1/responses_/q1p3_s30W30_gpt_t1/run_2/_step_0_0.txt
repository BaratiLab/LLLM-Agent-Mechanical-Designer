  "preamble": "Optimize closed 2D truss minimizing stress under given load & supports within stress and mass limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given 3 nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Load: -10N at -45° acting on node_3. Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Max stress ±30, max mass ≤30.",
  
  "analysis": "3 nodes colinear initially, need to form a closed truss (triangle) which is stable and transfers load efficiently. Introduce a new node above the baseline connecting to all 3 nodes to form a triangular, statically determinate structure. This creates 6 members max (3 bottom + 3 to top node). Check member lengths and choose member areas to meet stress and mass constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 above baseline near node_3 x=2, y>0. Connect node_4 to node_1, node_2, node_3 to close truss with 4 nodes. Members: (1-2), (2-3), (1-3), (1-4), (2-4), (3-4).",
  
  "reasoning": "Triangular closed truss is simplest for stability and load distribution. Load at node_3 at 45° angle. Assume axial forces only. Use approximate static equilibrium to find member forces. Areas selected from given discrete values to control stress <30, minimize mass. Length is Euclidean distance between nodes. Mass = sum(length*area).",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assume node_4 at (2,2.5) for optimal height to reduce member axial forces. Member length calc by sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2). Simplified equilibrium: horizontal and vertical force balance at loaded node and supports. Use basic axial force formulas for truss members.",
