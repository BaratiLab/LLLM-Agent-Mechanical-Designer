Explore redesign to reduce max stress and mass.",\n  "analysis": "Max stress at member_3 (-39.89) exceeds compressive limit. Member areas partly low (area_id 1 = 0.195) but stress fails. Overall mass 10.4873 is OK but can reduce. Current geometry has short span (2–4) but member_3 (1–3) highly stressed. Load direction (-10 @ -45°) induces combined axial and bending forces, causing stress spike in member_3. Support nodes fixed at (0,0) and (6,0).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Raise node_4 vertically or add intermediate node to reduce stress in horizontal members. Remove highly stressed members or replace with multiple smaller members in truss pattern. Use stronger areas on highly stressed members while lowering area elsewhere. Member_3 area too small and length too short, focus on load path via node_3.",\n  "proposal": "Fix support/load nodes. Add an intermediate node (node_5) near center above node_3 to create a triangular truss. Members: (1–3), (3–5), (5–4), (4–2), (1–5), (5–2). Assign area sizes to reduce max stress and total mass. Use area_ids mostly 2 or 3 for high stress members and 1 for low stress members.",\n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 splits load path reducing member 3 stress. Triangular arrangement increases stiffness and distributes load. Upgrading areas to 2 or 3 strengthens members under high stress.
