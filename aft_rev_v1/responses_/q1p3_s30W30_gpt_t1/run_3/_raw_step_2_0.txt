Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Five nodes with current structure exceeding stress and mass limits: max stress 35.7 > 30 and mass ~20.6 close but stress violation on member_4 (35.7). Aim: reduce stress below 30 and keep mass <= 30.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current high stress at member_4 suggests overstressed element likely due to geometry or insufficient member areas. Mass is within limit but stress notably above bounds. Structural topology needs improvement to distribute load better. Existing nodes for load/support fixed. Current diagonal and vertical members insufficient. Node_5 at (2.8,3.5) can be repositioned or replaced. Propose adding an additional node to improve truss depth and reduce stress concentration. Use areas efficiently: smaller where low stress, larger where high stress. Maintain statically determinate or slightly hyperstatic for stability. Try topology resembling typical Pratt or Warren truss for load applied at node_3.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding one node between node_3 and node_4 horizontally or vertically to form better load path. Possibly reposition node_5 slightly or replace it with two nodes. Member_4 connecting node_2 to node_5 is overstressed; reducing length or increasing redundancy may help. Use area codes 3 or 4 for high load members, 1 or 2 for low load members to reduce mass.",\n\n  "proposal": "Keep existing nodes for support/load: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0). Add new node_6 at (4.0, 2.0) to create additional load path. Remove node_5 and member_4 to reduce overstress. Connect members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_6, node_6-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_6-node_2. Dimension members with suitable areas to satisfy stress and mass constraints.",\n\n  "reasoning": "By adding node_6 at (4.0,2.0), we introduce an intermediate node that allows better force distribution between node_3 and node_4, and node_4 and node_2. This improves load path and reduces high stress on a single member. Removing node_5 eliminates long diagonal member causing high stress holding node_2 to node_5. Connecting node_3, node_4, node_6, and node_2 with triangular elements improves stiffness and reduces member stresses. Using a mix of areas: medium-sized cross sections on high force members and smaller on less loaded members optimizes mass.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Length calculations: node_1-node_3 = 2 units, node_3-node_6 ~ sqrt((4-2)^2 + (2-0)^2) = 2.828, node_6-node_4 = sqrt((4-4)^2 + (3-2)^2) =1, node_4-node_2= sqrt((6-4)^2 + (0-3)^2)=3.605, node_1-node_4= sqrt((4-0)^2 + (3-0)^2)=5, node_3-node_4= sqrt((4-2)^2 + (3-0)^2)=3.605, node_6-node_2= sqrt((6-4)^2 + (0-2)^2)=2.828. Assign areas: members in load path area 3 (1.759), others area 1 (0.195) or 2 (0.782). Total mass roughly under 30 given this setup.",\n\n  "calculation": "Sum masses = Σ(length * area). For instance, node_1-node_3: 2*0.782=1.564, node_3-node_6: 2.828*1.759=4.97, node_6-node_4:1*0.195=0.195, node_4-node_2:3.605*0.782=2.82, node_1-node_4:5*0.195=0.975, node_3-node_4:3.605*0.195=0.703, node_6-node_2:2.828*0.782=2.212.
