Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Current max stress 48.35 exceeds ±30 and mass 13.44 <30. Need stress reduction mainly on member_3 and member_5.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has stress violations: member_3 at -48.35 (too compressive), member_5 at +40.29 (too tensile). Mass is acceptable. Node_4 and node_6 placements cause high stress members. Members connecting node_3, node_4 and node_6 see high stress concentration. Load applied at node_3 on the bottom chord causing high forces in diagonals/middle verticals. Current structure complexity may be increased for better force flow to reduce max stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, add a vertical node above node_3 to better transfer load to supports. Re-route force paths using additional top node. Optimize members around node_3. Increase some member areas to reduce stress but keep mass controlled. Use favorable area sizes like \'1\'(0.195), \'2\'(0.782), \'3\'(1.759).",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep nodes 1,2,3 fixed. Add new node_5 at (2.0, 3.5) vertical above node_3. Retain node_4 at (4.0, 3.0). Remove node_6 to simplify force flow. Members: bottom chord (1-3,3-2), vertical (3-5), diagonals (1-5,2-4,5-4,4-3). Areas allocated to control stress, smaller areas for less stressed members, larger for critical load bearing.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 above node_3 creates a vertical member to better share vertical load from node_3. Node_4 extended at (4,3) acts as a compression strut transferring force to node_2. Removing node_6 removes a low stressed intermediate node reducing complexity. Member sizing will be balanced to keep mass low and stress under ±30. The proposed geometry facilitates better load path for downward 10N load at 45°, reducing stress on previously overloaded members.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate length and estimate axial forces roughly: member 3-5 is vertical ~3.5m, good for compressive force transfer. Member 5-4 is diagonal ~2.06m, member 4-2 diagonal ~3.0m, members 1-3 and 3-2 horizontal bottom chords 2 and 4m respectively. Areas chosen in range 1-3 per member length to keep mass balanced.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths: 1-3=2.0, 3-2=4.0, 3-5=3.5, 5-4~2.06, 4-2=3.0, 1-5~3.91, 4-3~2.24. Assume areas: members 1-3,3-2 with \'2\'(0.782), 3-5 with \'3\'(1.759), 5-4 with \'1\'(0.195), 1-5 with \'1\'(0.195), 4-2 with \'2\'(0.782), 4-3 with \'1\'(0.195).
