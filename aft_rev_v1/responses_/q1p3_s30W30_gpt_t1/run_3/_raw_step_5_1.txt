Mass is 18.82 < 30 limit. Load and support nodes not moved per instructions. Stress levels on all members are safe. Node_4 and node_5 moved slightly to improve force distribution. Member areas chosen to balance mass and capacity. No members exceed stress limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further improvements in stress reduction will be marginal as max stress is already less than half limit. Moving free nodes further risks violating geometric stability or mass. Current closed truss with 5 nodes and 7 members is structurally stable and efficient.",\n  "reasoning": "Minor redistribution of nodal positions and member area selections have reduced member stresses significantly over iterations. Further optimization unlikely to yield practical improvements and may increase complexity or mass. Hence, stop is justified.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress safety margin is ~2.5 times the max stress limit. Member cross sections appropriate for forces. Total mass is ~63% of max allowed mass.
