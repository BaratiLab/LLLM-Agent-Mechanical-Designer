Load on node_3, supports fixed. Current design uses 5 free nodes with member areas mostly small to moderate.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress close to limit, dominated by member_6 (27.843) connected between node_1 and node_5. To reduce stress, move free nodes to reduce stress in member_6 and overall structure. Members forming triangles around load need improved geometry. Mass has room for slight increase if beneficial for stress distribution. Maintain closed topology. Node_1 and node_2 fixed due to supports and load, move node_3, node_4, node_5 only. Consider shifting node_5 slightly upwards and right to better align force path and reduce tension in member_6.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Avoid increasing member areas too much to not overshoot mass. Possibly increase area on low-stress members for better distribution, reduce area on high-stress member if length can be reduced or stress bypassed by geometry change.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Stress in member_6 is high likely because of geometryâ€”node_5 close to node_1 makes a long or inefficient load path. By moving node_5 slightly up and right, length of member_6 may increase but stress can reduce due to improved force flow. Slightly moving node_4 up-right could also help. Keep node_3 fixed at (2,0) due to load. Member areas can remain same except member_6 area may be increased from 1 (0.195 area) to 2 (0.782) to reduce stress if mass budget permits. Members surrounding node_5 should be reviewed, but area 1 and 2 mostly moderate already.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approximate: m6 length from node_1 (0,0) to node_5 (2,3.5) ~ sqrt(4 + 12.25) = 3.905. Moving node_5 up-right by 0.3 to (2.3,3.8) changes length to sqrt(5.29+14.44)=3.99, small increase. Tension might drop as geometry improves. Check impact on members connected to node_5: member_3 (3) connects node_3 (2,0) and node_5 (2,3.5). Moving node_5 changes length from 3.5 to sqrt((2-2)^2 + (3.8-0)^2) = 3.8 reduced length. This may reduce stress in member_3 too. Member_4 node_5 to node_4 (4,3) length current ~ sqrt(4 + 0.25)=2.06. Moving node_5 right-up to (2.3,3.8) makes length ~ sqrt(2.89+0.64)=1.96 shorter, which increases member_4 stress possibly but it has low current stress.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Propose new node_5: (2.3, 3.8), node_4: move slightly to (4.1, 3.1) for better load path. Keep node_3 fixed at (2,0), node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0). Member areas mostly same except increase member_6 area from \'1\'(0.195) to \'2\'(0.782) to reduce member_6 stress. Approximate new total mass: current 15.5592 + (0.782-0.195)*length_m6 approx length_m6 ~3.9, increase ~0.582*3.9=2.27 -> new mass ~17.83 < 30 allowed.
