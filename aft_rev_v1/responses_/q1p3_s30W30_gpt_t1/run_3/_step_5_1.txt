  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to minimize stress, within given constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress ±30 MPa; total mass ≤ 30; load at node_3; node_1 and node_2 fixed; node_3 and node_2 fixed positions; existing design under max stress and mass limits.",
  "analysis": "Current max stress is 13.25 MPa well below limit of 30 MPa. Mass is 18.82 < 30 limit. Load and support nodes not moved per instructions. Stress levels on all members are safe. Node_4 and node_5 moved slightly to improve force distribution. Member areas chosen to balance mass and capacity. No members exceed stress limits.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further improvements in stress reduction will be marginal as max stress is already less than half limit. Moving free nodes further risks violating geometric stability or mass. Current closed truss with 5 nodes and 7 members is structurally stable and efficient.",
  "reasoning": "Minor redistribution of nodal positions and member area selections have reduced member stresses significantly over iterations. Further optimization unlikely to yield practical improvements and may increase complexity or mass. Hence, stop is justified.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress safety margin is ~2.5 times the max stress limit. Member cross sections appropriate for forces. Total mass is ~63% of max allowed mass. All constraints met. Load path and support reactions well distributed.",
  "calculation": "No changes needed as constraints and objectives are met. Current node and member configuration is balanced for minimal stress and acceptable mass.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints satisfied. Max stress <30, mass <30. Load/support nodes fixed. No duplicate nodes or members. Cleared for stopping.",
