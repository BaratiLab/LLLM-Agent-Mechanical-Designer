To form a closed truss, add at least one node above or below to form a triangle(s). The load at node_3 is downward left. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) fix structure. Minimizing max stress and mass suggests shorter members with moderate areas. Equilateral or near-triangular shapes distribute forces well. Only one extra node can close the truss into a triangle with three members edges or possibly more complex but minimal connections better. Use node_4 above node_3. Minimum length members reduce mass and stress. Choose cross-sectional areas from given discrete set, smaller area under compressive/tensile stress less than 30. Check member stresses by statics, approximate axial forces. Balance supports and load reactions - assume linear elastic.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2, 2.5) near node_3 to create two triangles sharing node_3: triangles (node1-node3-node4) and (node2-node3-node4).

Approximate axial forces with load vector and support reactions by static equilibrium (sum forces/moments=0). Axial stress = force/(area×area_constant), area_constant=1 (for simplification).
