  "preamble": "Optimize a closed 2D truss minimizing stress with given nodes, load, supports, area and mass constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes fixed: node_1(0,0) pinned; node_2(6,0) roller; node_3(2,0) load (-10 at -45°). Max stress ±30, max mass 30. Areas given discretely. Need closed truss ensuring no duplicates, optimize mass and stress, keep nodes fixed.",
  
  "analysis": "The given nodes are colinear along x-axis. To form a closed truss, add at least one node above or below to form a triangle(s). The load at node_3 is downward left. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) fix structure. Minimizing max stress and mass suggests shorter members with moderate areas. Equilateral or near-triangular shapes distribute forces well. Only one extra node can close the truss into a triangle with three members edges or possibly more complex but minimal connections better. Use node_4 above node_3. Minimum length members reduce mass and stress. Choose cross-sectional areas from given discrete set, smaller area under compressive/tensile stress less than 30. Check member stresses by statics, approximate axial forces. Balance supports and load reactions - assume linear elastic.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2, 2.5) near node_3 to create two triangles sharing node_3: triangles (node1-node3-node4) and (node2-node3-node4). Members: (1-3), (2-3), (3-4), (1-4), (2-4). Lengths and forces computed via trigonometric statics. Areas chosen to keep stress ≤30. Approximate mass sum within 30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Add node_4 above node_3 to close truss (triangle with node_3's neighbors). Members: 1-3, 2-3, 1-4, 2-4, 3-4. This shape balances forces and improves stiffness. Area selection uses smallest area to keep stress ≤30. Short members reduce mass. Calculate member lengths from node coordinates. Approximate axial forces with load vector and support reactions by static equilibrium (sum forces/moments=0). Axial stress = force/(area×area_constant), area_constant=1 (for simplification). Choose area index accordingly. Check total mass = Σ(length × area_constant_area_id), must be ≤30; area constant from input dictionary given.",
