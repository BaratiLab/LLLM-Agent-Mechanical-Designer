    "preamble": "Optimize a simple closed 2D truss with 3 given nodes, minimize stress ≤ ±30 and mass ≤ 30.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes fixed: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Load at node_3 is -10 units at -45°. Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Need closed truss (all connected) with minimal stress and mass under constraints.",
    
    "analysis": "The three nodes lie on x-axis; to form a closed truss (a triangle), add node_4 above line between node_1 and node_2 to stabilize and enable load transfer. Node_4 must be placed to form two additional members from node_3 to node_4 and node_4 to node_1 & node_2, creating a truss triangle. This configuration reduces axial force on members and allows compressive-tensile forces to balance. Support conditions prevent horizontal and vertical displacement at node_1, only vertical at node_2.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (3.0, 2.5) roughly center top to form triangle. Member connections: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4. This creates a closed truss with 5 members. Use areas optimally: start with small area for longer members, larger area for highly loaded members to keep stress ≤30 and minimize mass.",
    
    "reasoning": "For given load -10 at node_3 at -45°, resolve forces in members by static equilibrium. Forces in members connecting load node should be higher. Members along support line carry reaction forces. Use trigonometric relations to resolve member forces. Areas selected from provided list; smaller cross sections chosen for longer members to minimize mass but must satisfy stress constraints: stress = force / area ≤ 30.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear elastic behavior, static equilibrium, triangular truss. Length calculated by Euclidean distance. Force estimation using method of joints. Area chosen by stress limit: area ≥ force / 30. Mass approximated as sum(length * area).",
    
    "calculation": "Member lengths (approx):\nnode_1-node_3 (2 units), node_3-node_2 (4 units), node_1-node_4 (sqrt(3^2+2.5^2)=3.905), node_4-node_2 (same 3.905), node_3-node_4 (sqrt((3-2)^2 + (2.5-0)^2)=2.693).\nEstimate member forces: node_3 carries load -10 at 45°.\nResolve forces by method of joints:\nAt node_3: forces in node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2 combined with node_3-node_4 balancing load.\nApprox peak force ~14 units in most loaded member.\nArea required: area = force / stress_max = ~14/30=0.47 → choose area_id '1' (0.195) too small; pick '2' (0.782) or '3'(1.759) for critical members.\nAssign area:\n- Highly loaded members (node_3-node_4, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2) area_id '2' (0.782)\n- Lighter members (node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2) area_id '1' (0.195).\nCalculate mass:\nSum(length×area): 2*0.782 + 4*0.782 + 3.905*0.195*2 + 2.693*0.782= approx 1.564 + 3.128 + 1.523 + 2.106 = 8.321 << 30 constraint, safe margin.\nCheck max stress:\nMax force/area for critical = 14/0.782=17.9 <30 safe.\nClosed truss ensured by connections forming triangle including node_4.",
    
    "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 addition enables closed truss to accommodate load and supports. Member sizing meets stress and mass limits. All members connected, no duplicates. Node positions unchanged for given nodes. Load and support respected. Approximation suitable for first iteration.",
