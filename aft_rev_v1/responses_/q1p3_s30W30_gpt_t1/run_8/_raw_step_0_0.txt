Node_4 must be placed to form two additional members from node_3 to node_4 and node_4 to node_1 & node_2, creating a truss triangle. This configuration reduces axial force on members and allows compressive-tensile forces to balance. Support conditions prevent horizontal and vertical displacement at node_1, only vertical at node_2.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (3.0, 2.5) roughly center top to form triangle. Member connections: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4. This creates a closed truss with 5 members.
