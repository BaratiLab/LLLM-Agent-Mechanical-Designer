  "preamble": "Current structure meets stress and mass constraints with low max stress.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints max stress ±30, max mass 30. Current max stress 7.24 well below limit; total mass 23.54 below 30. Load on node_3 at -45°, supports fixed. Node_5 moved up from previous iteration, area sizing increased, reducing stresses significantly.",
  "analysis": "The current truss has balanced stress distribution with maximum stress ~7.24, far from the allowable ±30 limit. The mass is 23.54 which is below the 30 limit, leaving margin for further optimization. The major compressive and tensile stresses are moderated. No stress peaks noted on critical members, and the geometry ensures a stable closed truss polygon. With loads and supports fixed, node_5 position and member area have been optimized to reduce stress significantly from iteration 0.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further attempts to reduce stress by shifting node positions or drastically changing member areas will likely increase mass or cause stress redistribution that may violate constraints. Current member areas (mostly 2 and 3) reflect a balanced sizing based on stress demand. Node_5 is optimally placed vertically above node_3 to provide effective geometry for load transfer and reduced member forces.",
  "reasoning": "Given the low max stress relative to allowable limits, it is structurally and economically efficient to retain the current geometry and member sizing. Moving node_5 excessively might destabilize stress distribution. Reducing member areas risks increasing stress beyond limits. Maintaining closed truss polygon and load path integrity favors current layout. Since both objectives (minimize stress and mass within constraints) are satisfied with good margin, stopping optimization is justified.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and geometry support current load and boundary conditions. Stress levels (around ±7) are well below 30 limit. Mass 23.54 < 30. Changing node_3 or support nodes forbidden. Node_5 position at (2.0, 3.0) effective. Areas chosen from catalog appropriate. No violations detected. Optimization converged.",
  "calculation": "Calculated members' stress and mass based on areas from catalog; max stress is 7.24 < 30; total mass 23.54 < 30. Load and supports fixed, node_5 position and member areas optimal. No member stresses close to constraints, so safe margin preserved.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints verified. Load and supports fixed. Node_3 and support nodes immutable. Geometry closed and stable. Stress minimal and within limits. Mass efficiently allocated. Stop optimization.",
