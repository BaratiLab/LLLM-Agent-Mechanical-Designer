First iteration with fixed nodal positions for supports and load.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current nodes are colinear (y=0), so closed truss must involve at least one additional node above or below to form a triangular or 3-bar closed loop. Load at node_3 downward-left (-10 N, -45°). Supports asymmetric (pinned and roller) producing reaction forces. The simplest stable closed truss is triangle formed by nodes 1, 2, and 3 plus one elevated or depressed node to create non-collinearity. To avoid changing existing nodes, add a new node (node_4) above the x-axis between node_1 and node_2 to form a stable triangular truss, preventing buckling and distributing stresses. Members will interconnect to form closed loop: 1-3, 3-4, 4-1 and 4-2, 2-3 to ensure full connectivity.

Total mass sum(length * area); verify within 30. Adjust areas iteratively.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Closed truss must have at least 3 nodes non-collinear to ensure stability and enclosure. Ideal to introduce one node above baseline to create triangle to resist applied load. Support conditions give stable reactions at nodes 1 and 2. Members sized to reduce mass while keeping stress ≤ 30.
