Current mass 40.3 exceeds mass limit though stresses are good (max 9.04). Need to reduce mass by optimizing member areas and layout.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure heavy due to large areas (area 4) on long diagonal members from node_1 and node_2 to node_5. Node_5 is close to node_3 vertically, creating a long diagonal with heavy members. Recommend adding an intermediate node closer to load point to reduce member lengths, and reducing cross-sectional areas especially on longer members. Maintain stable triangular layout for stiffness.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_5, add new node closer to node_3 to split long diagonals into shorter members. Reduce areas on long members to 2 or 3. Keep bottom chord members with moderate areas. Possibly add top chord nodes for better load transfer. Prioritize mass reduction while keeping stresses under limit.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_4 at (3.0, 2.5) between node_3 and node_5 vertical line. Remove node_5. Members: node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4. Areas 2 or 3 on diagonals, smaller areas 1 or 0.8 on bottom chords. Resulting mass should be under 30 and stresses < 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Shorter members reduce required area to carry load, reducing mass. Triangles maintain structural stability. Keeping existing nodes affects design marginally but new node allows better force distribution and less mass. Lower area numbered members reduce mass significantly.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4 at (3.0, 2.5).
