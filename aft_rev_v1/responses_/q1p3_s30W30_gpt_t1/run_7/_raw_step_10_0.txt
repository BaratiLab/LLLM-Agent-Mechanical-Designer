Members mostly moderate areas with compression and tension balanced. Load at node_3 and supports fixed. Node_4 raised slightly compared to past to reduce stresses on critical members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further major node shifts limited by support and load node fixity. Member connectivity forms closed quadrilateral with reasonable diagonals and base. Stress is low and well distributed; mass usage is moderate, so structure is efficient.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Trying to reduce stress further when current max stress ~9.5 (well below 30) risks increasing mass or moving node_4 away from optimal. Past design history shows smaller heights increased stress and some exceeded 30. Areas are balanced, no member excessively large or small. Minor node_4 movement unlikely to reduce stress significantly or improve mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and stress flux are appropriate. Load direction fixed; stress level meets safety, current design near local optimum. Additional topology changes forbidden. No member area changes optimal beyond current selection since mass and stress are low.",\n\n  "calculation": "Total mass 15.6249 (below 30), max stress 9.51 <30; member stresses balanced -6.74 to 9.39. With given geometry, further node_4 movement will raise stress or mass. All constraints respected, margins large enough.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Optimized design reached. Stop optimization defer all further changes. Node_4 position (2.75, 2.3) is stable for low stress and mass efficiency. Member areas are chosen to balance stress and mass.
