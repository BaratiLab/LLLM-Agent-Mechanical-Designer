Load at node_3 fixed; supports fixed at node_1, node_2; can move node_4 only.",\n  "analysis": "Current max stress at member_5 (node_2-node_4) is high (23.9). Reduce stress by reducing member length or redistributing forces via node_4 location. Member_5 area is smallest (area_id=1:0.195), difficult to increase cross-section due to mass constraints. member_4 and member_3 have medium areas, moderate stress. Lower stress by moving node_4 closer to node_3 and lowering y-height to reduce bending forces and improve load path efficiency.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try shifting node_4 slightly towards node_3 along x-axis, slightly lowering y-coordinate from 1.7 to ~1.5. Keep node_4 within range (x ~3.0-3.2, y ~1.4-1.6). Keep members same with areas as is to not increase mass. Expect reduced member_5 stress from shorter length and angle better aligned with load transfer.",\n  "reasoning": "Member_5 stress is tensile and dominates max stress. Since member_5 area is smallest, increasing area not used to save mass. By bringing node_4 closer to node_3 and slightly lower, member lengths redistribute loads efficiently. member_3 and member_4 should maintain or reduce stress so overall max stress drops below current 23.9. Member_1 and member_2 stresses are acceptable. Nodes for load/support fixed, only node_4 adjusted.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_4: (3.1, 1.7) -> Proposed new ~ (3.05, 1.55). Measure distance node_2 to node_4: original sqrt((6-3.1)^2 + (0-1.7)^2)=sqrt(8.41+2.89)=3.6, new sqrt((6-3.05)^2+(0-1.55)^2)=sqrt(8.7+2.4)=3.65 approx; length nearly same, but angle changes. Length is similar, but due to geometry change, axial stresses should reduce due to better force distribution. Member_3 length reduces slightly, improving stress. Check mass impact minimal.",\n  "calculation": "Move node_4 to (3.05, 1.55). Members and areas unchanged. Mass ~12.8 remains under 30. Expect max stress reduction from geometry change achievable given load direction (-10 at node_3, -45 deg).
