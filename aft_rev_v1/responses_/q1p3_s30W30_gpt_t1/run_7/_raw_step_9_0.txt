Total mass 15.32 below 30 max. Load at node_3, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Optimize node_4\'s position for stress uniformity and reduce max stress further.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member 5 stress reduced from 31.68 (iteration 7) to 5.43 (iteration 8) by raising node_4 to (2.85, 2.1). Other members have moderate stress levels. Further tuning node_4 vertically and horizontally may balance member stresses and reduce max stress. Member areas are mostly optimal: member_1 at area 3, member_2 at 2, members_3,4,5 at 2, member_6 at 1 suitable given current loads.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member 3 and 4 have compressive and tensile stresses close to 10, can slightly adjust node_4 to slightly reduce these. Member_5 stress low, possible small area reduction considered but risks increasing stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Since load and support nodes fixed, adjust node_4 slightly within vicinity while maintaining closed geometry. Slight increase of y to balance vertical load and small horizontal shift towards node_3 or node_2 can help redistribute stresses. Area selection is good; no need larger areas that increase mass. Mass well below limit. Slight repositioning is more effective than changing areas now.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Test node_4 from (2.85,2.1) to (2.75,2.3) or (2.9,2.0). Check if member lengths enable better force distribution and reduce max stress below current 10.16. Keep member areas constant: member_1(3), member_2(2), members_3/4/5(2), member_6(1). No new nodes or members added. Geometry remains closed quadrilateral.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Estimated moving node_4 slightly higher (y ~2.3) reduces compression in member_3 and tension in member_4. Slight horizontal shift left (x~2.75) reduces member_5 length and possibly stress. Member lengths recalc for mass: mass = length * area_coef. The slight y shift adds length but mass still under 20 and stress reduces. Keep member areas same to keep mass under 30. Max stress estimated ~8-9MPa after shift.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 revised to (2.75, 2.3) coordinates chosen for likely stress reduction and keeping mass low. Member connections unchanged, areas unchanged. No violation of constraints.
