  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while keeping constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 23.9 within limit Â±30; total mass 12.82 < 30. Load at node_3 fixed; supports fixed at node_1, node_2; can move node_4 only.",
  "analysis": "Current max stress at member_5 (node_2-node_4) is high (23.9). Reduce stress by reducing member length or redistributing forces via node_4 location. Member_5 area is smallest (area_id=1:0.195), difficult to increase cross-section due to mass constraints. member_4 and member_3 have medium areas, moderate stress. Lower stress by moving node_4 closer to node_3 and lowering y-height to reduce bending forces and improve load path efficiency.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try shifting node_4 slightly towards node_3 along x-axis, slightly lowering y-coordinate from 1.7 to ~1.5. Keep node_4 within range (x ~3.0-3.2, y ~1.4-1.6). Keep members same with areas as is to not increase mass. Expect reduced member_5 stress from shorter length and angle better aligned with load transfer.",
  "reasoning": "Member_5 stress is tensile and dominates max stress. Since member_5 area is smallest, increasing area not used to save mass. By bringing node_4 closer to node_3 and slightly lower, member lengths redistribute loads efficiently. member_3 and member_4 should maintain or reduce stress so overall max stress drops below current 23.9. Member_1 and member_2 stresses are acceptable. Nodes for load/support fixed, only node_4 adjusted.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_4: (3.1, 1.7) -> Proposed new ~ (3.05, 1.55). Measure distance node_2 to node_4: original sqrt((6-3.1)^2 + (0-1.7)^2)=sqrt(8.41+2.89)=3.6, new sqrt((6-3.05)^2+(0-1.55)^2)=sqrt(8.7+2.4)=3.65 approx; length nearly same, but angle changes. Length is similar, but due to geometry change, axial stresses should reduce due to better force distribution. Member_3 length reduces slightly, improving stress. Check mass impact minimal.",
  "calculation": "Move node_4 to (3.05, 1.55). Members and areas unchanged. Mass ~12.8 remains under 30. Expect max stress reduction from geometry change achievable given load direction (-10 at node_3, -45 deg). Final max stress predicted to reduce from 23.9 to ~18-20 due to reduced bending moment and improved force path.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify node positions: node_1 (0.0, 0.0), node_2 (6.0, 0.0), node_3 (2.0, 0.0), node_4 (3.05, 1.55). Member connections and areas unchanged to preserve mass and structural behavior. Constraints satisfied. Further stress reduction possible by area increase but constrained by mass, or adding nodes which is not allowed. Thus optimize node_4 only at this step.",
