  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce stress concentrations while maintaining constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 20.31 below 30 threshold. Total mass 13.35 well below 30. Load applied at node_3 downward-left. Supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. Node_3 and supports fixed positions must remain unchanged. Member areas mostly small except member_1 with area 3 and members 2-4 with area 2 or 1. Focus on reducing stress on member_5 (20.307, near max) by adjusting geometry.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress currently at member_5 between node_2 and node_4 with tensile 20.307, significant compared to others. Member_3 and member_1 are compressive with notable stress. Node_4 is currently at (3.3, 2.0). Lowering or shifting node_4 position slightly may balance force distribution and reduce max stress, especially in member_5. Member areas appear consistent with stress needs. Current truss shape is a quadrilateral with a diagonal from node_3 to node_4.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_4 slightly left and/or down to reduce tensile stress in member_5 without increasing stress elsewhere beyond 30. Maintain closed truss with members connecting all nodes and edges. Node_4 y-position might be decreased from 2.0 to ~1.7-1.8, x position possibly reduced toward 3.0 for better load distribution. Keep member area assignments unchanged unless stress reduction inadequate.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_5 has smallest cross-sectional area(1) but highest stress(20.3). Increasing area was not allowed by instructions, but moving node_4 closer to node_2 horizontally or lowering it could reduce elongation and tensile stress in member_5 by decreasing length and changing force angles. Member_3 and member_4 stresses are moderate; avoid increasing those beyond limits. Balance between node_4's vertical and horizontal movement essential. Edge members (1,2,6) show good margins.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member_5 length current sqrt((6-3.3)^2+(0-2)^2)=sqrt(2.7^2+2^2)=sqrt(7.29+4)=sqrt(11.29)=3.36 approx. If node_4 moved to (3.05,1.75), length reduces to sqrt((6-3.05)^2+(0-1.75)^2)=sqrt(2.95^2+1.75^2)=sqrt(8.7+3.06)=sqrt(11.76)=3.43, length slightly increased but angle changes may reduce axial tension component. Alternatively, move node_4 left to 3.0, down to 1.7: length sqrt((6-3)^2+(0-1.7)^2)=sqrt(3^2+1.7^2)=sqrt(9+2.89)=sqrt(11.89)=3.45 slightly longer but angle may improve force distribution. Try (3.1,1.7) midpoint for compromise. Keep member areas same. Expect slight stress relief in member_5 by geometry change.",
  
  "calculation": "Move node_4 from (3.3,2.0) to (3.1,1.7). Check closed loop: node_1 (0.0,0.0), node_2 (6.0,0.0), node_3 (2.0,0.0), node_4 (3.1,1.7). Member connections intact, no duplicates, all nodes unique, load and support nodes unchanged. Keep member areas: member_1: '3', member_2: '2', member_3: '2', member_4: '2', member_5: '1', member_6: '1'. Estimated total mass similar (~13.3), stresses expected to reduce max tensile stress below 20.3 due to improved geometry.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node positions updated within constraints, no changes to loads/supports. Closed truss ensured. No member area changed. Stress and mass constraints expected met. Optimization can continue in next iterations if needed.",
