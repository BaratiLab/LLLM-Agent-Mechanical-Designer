Member_5 has highest stress near limit. Node_4 is only free node to move.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High tensile stress in member_5 (node_2-node_4) at 25.987 indicates load path concentration there. Member_4 (node_1-node_4) tension at 13.3 and compressive members 1,2,3 moderate stress. Moving node_4 slightly can balance force paths, reducing peak stress in member_5 and adjacent members. Mass is well below limit, area assignments are reasonable per stress levels.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on lowering member_5 stress by repositioning node_4 closer towards node_3 or lowering vertical coordinate to better distribute forces. Avoid reducing height too much to keep truss stable. Small horizontal shifts towards node_3 likely improve force flows.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_5 stress decreases if node_4 moves slightly left and down to share load with members 3 and 4. Current node_4 at (3.05,1.55). Reduce y ~0.2-0.3, reduce x ~0.1-0.2 should reduce axial forces on member_5. Keep member areas same to maintain mass and stability. All constraints remain satisfied within these minor adjustments.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "New node_4 ~ (2.85, 1.3). Calculate approximate member lengths and expect reduced axial force on member_5. No change to nodes 1,2,3 due to supports and loads. Member connectivity unchanged to preserve closed truss.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Calculate member_5 length drop from sqrt((6-3.05)^2+(0-1.55)^2)=~3.3 to sqrt((6-2.85)^2+(0-1.3)^2)=~3.4 (slight increase length, stress depends on force distribution). Reducing height lowers axial tension by reducing vertical component of load path in member_5. Similarly, member_4 length sqrt(3.05^2+1.55^2)=~3.4 to sqrt(2.85^2+1.3^2)=~3.15 slightly reduced length helping member_4 stress. Member_3 also shortened from approx 1.59 to ~1.55. Overall expected to better distribute stresses and reduce peak tensile in member_5.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Preserve node_1,2,3 positions.
