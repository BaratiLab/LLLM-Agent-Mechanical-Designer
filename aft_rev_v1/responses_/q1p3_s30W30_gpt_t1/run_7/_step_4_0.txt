  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce peak stress below 18.88 within mass limit.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress is 18.88 < 30 and total mass 13.7369 < 30. Node_1 & node_2 fixed due to supports, node_3 fixed due to load. Node_4 position can be changed to redistribute forces and reduce peak stress. Members use mostly smaller area ids, keeping mass low. Aim to balance stress in member_5 (high tensile) and member_4 (compression) by adjusting node_4 location.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_5 (node_2-node_4) has highest tensile stress near limit, 18.88, area id '1' (0.195 area) is small. Increasing area reduces stress but adds mass. Instead, moving node_4 closer to node_2 horizontally and reducing vertical height could reduce tensile force in member_5. Also, reducing vertical height reduces length of members 3,4,5 which reduces mass and axial force. Member_4 compression (9.42) can also be reduced by closer node_4 to node_1 horizontal. Balancing position to reduce stress in member_5 and member_3 (compression -9.73) is key.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try lowering node_4 Y from 2.5 to ~1.8-2.0. Shift node_4 X slightly towards 3.3 to increase angle of member_5 and reduce axial tension. Check if total mass remains well below 30. Keep member areas unchanged as current seems efficient.",
  
  "reasoning": "Decreasing height of node_4 reduces forces along members connected to it and member length, reducing mass and stress. Slight horizontal shift allows better force distribution between members 4 and 5. Keeping small cross sectional area for member 5 reduces mass impact. With low mass current structure, can allow slight increase in area for member_5 if stress doesn't reduce enough by geometry. But first optimize geometry only to meet instructions. Load and support node positions fixed, no new nodes.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths (approx):\nmember_5 length currently ~ sqrt((6-3)^2+(0-2.5)^2)=3.905\nLowering node_4 Y to 2 reduces length to sqrt(3^2+2^2)=3.605\nReduces member_5 axial force,\nmember_3 length sqrt((3-2)^2+(2-0)^2) reduced similarly,\nMember_4 (node_1-node_4) length reduces too.\nLower total member length reduces mass and stress.\nCheck if stress <18.88 and mass <30 after move.",
  
  "calculation": "Propose new node_4 at (3.3, 2.0). Member lengths updated:\nmember_5: sqrt((6-3.3)^2+(0-2)^2)= sqrt(2.7^2+2^2)=3.39 (smaller length)\nmember_4: sqrt((0-3.3)^2+(0-2)^2)=3.87 (slightly longer but angle changes)\nMember stresses should balance better. Mass remains below 15 approx.\nKeep member areas unchanged: member_5: '1' (0.195) minimal mass,\nOthers as is.\nExpect max stress to reduce to ~14-16 from 18.88 by geometric reallocation of load.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_1 (0.0,0.0), Node_2 (6.0,0.0), Node_3 (2.0,0.0), Node_4 (3.3,2.0).\nKeep members same with areas from last iteration.\nExpect improved stress distribution. Continue optimization until stress <15 or minimum achievable, then stop.",
