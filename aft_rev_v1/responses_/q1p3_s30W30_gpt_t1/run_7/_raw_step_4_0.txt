Node_1 & node_2 fixed due to supports, node_3 fixed due to load. Node_4 position can be changed to redistribute forces and reduce peak stress. Members use mostly smaller area ids, keeping mass low.

Increasing area reduces stress but adds mass. Instead, moving node_4 closer to node_2 horizontally and reducing vertical height could reduce tensile force in member_5. Also, reducing vertical height reduces length of members 3,4,5 which reduces mass and axial force. Member_4 compression (9.42) can also be reduced by closer node_4 to node_1 horizontal. Balancing position to reduce stress in member_5 and member_3 (compression -9.73) is key.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try lowering node_4 Y from 2.5 to ~1.8-2.0. Shift node_4 X slightly towards 3.3 to increase angle of member_5 and reduce axial tension. Check if total mass remains well below 30. Keep member areas unchanged as current seems efficient.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Decreasing height of node_4 reduces forces along members connected to it and member length, reducing mass and stress. Slight horizontal shift allows better force distribution between members 4 and 5. Keeping small cross sectional area for member 5 reduces mass impact. With low mass current structure, can allow slight increase in area for member_5 if stress doesn\'t reduce enough by geometry. But first optimize geometry only to meet instructions.
