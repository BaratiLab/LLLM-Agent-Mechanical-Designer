Current max stress 13.75 and total mass ~14 well under limits.",\n  "analysis": "All member stress values are well under the Â±30 constraint. Total structure mass is less than half the allowed maximum. Key nodes at supports (node_1 and node_2) and load (node_3) are fixed. Node_4 was moved from (2.0,3.0) to (2.6,2.5) to reduce stress and mass with beneficial effect. Areas are mostly set to \'2\' (0.782) plus one \'1\' (0.195) member resulting in an efficient, light truss well within constraints. No sign of concentrated stress or mass inefficiency.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further adjustments to node_4 position or member areas would diminish returns. The stress in the highest member (member_1 at -13.7475) is far below the allowed max, so material can likely not be further reduced without risking stress violations. Node movements are constrained for load and support nodes.",\n  "reasoning": "Member lengths and forces indicate stable triangulated configuration. The diagonal node_4 moved to more optimal position balances load paths. Reducing member areas further may increase stress, increasing node spacing might help, but load and support constraints limit that. Current design appears close to global optimum given constraints without creating redundancy wastes or stress concentration.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member stresses and mass are all within casing limits for given areas. Largest stress member is member_1 -13.75 within limits. Mass 13.9933 < 30 confirms efficiency. No overlap or duplicate members/nodes detected.",\n  "calculation": "Computed member lengths and member stresses support current areas choice. Directly moving nodes other than node_4 not allowed. Minor node_4 moves previously lowered max stress and total mass. Further significant decrease not achievable within constraints. Areas correspond with mass and stress distribution efficiently.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Current structure is optimized: Load and support restraints fixed nodes.
