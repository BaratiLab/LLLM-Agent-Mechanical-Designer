  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss node positions (except supports and loads) to minimize max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 29.05 close to limit±30, total mass 15.75 well below 30 max. Nodes node_1 & node_2 fixed by supports, node_3 fixed by load. Only node_4 free to move. Cross-members have low to moderate stresses. High stress at member_5 (29.05 tension).",
  
  "analysis": "Member_5 is critical, near max allowable tension. Moving node_4 to better align members may reduce stress in member_5 by redistributing forces. Longer vertical members inducing bending and tension in member_5 can be adjusted. Member_4 uses thicker area (3), may be optimized. Mass usage moderate, leaving room to adjust by redistributing stress allowing smaller areas for some members after node moves. Ensuring closed truss shape, no adding or removing nodes or members. Can we create more direct load path by repositioning node_4 slightly to reduce bending moment on node_3->node_4 & node_1->node_4 members to aid stress reduction in member_5. Areas generally small which is good for keeping mass down but may be increased slightly for critical members if needed. Node_3 to node_4 verticality could be slightly corrected for balancing compression-tension components.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Priority: shift node_4 slightly horizontally and vertically to reduce stress concentration at member_5, reassign areas from area_id '3' (1.759) to possibly '2'(0.782) or '4'(3.128) balancing stress and mass. Inspect impact on other member stresses and reduce max stress. Verify no increase above 30 or mass exceeds 30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Node_4 at (2,3) creates high tension in member_5 node_1-node_4 (area_id='1' or set currently '1'=0.195?), this may be undersized given loading. Increasing area on member_5 or moving node_4 closing horizontal distance to node_1 reduces tension force. Try moving node_4 closer to node_1 horizontally. Slight vertical reduction reducing lever arm. Also widen node_4 horizontally between node_1 and node_2 creating more symmetric distribution and reduce max tension. Config should keep node_3 fixed at (2,0) load and fixed supports. Member lengths after moving should approximate relations to keep mass below 30.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Forced constraints: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0) stationary. Move node_4 from (2,3)-> candidate moves at increasing x to 2.5 or 3 and decreasing y from 3 to 2.5, testing stress improvements. Recalculate approx lengths and member strain changes indirectly. Areas change vote: keep smaller area for compressed members, increase area at member_5 if needed up to area_id=2 (0.782). Check mass: estimated length sum × areas under 30.",
  
  "calculation": "Approx new node_4 candidate (2.6,2.5): member lengths - node_1-node_4 ~ sqrt(2.6^2+2.5^2)=3.6 small increase from 3 but tension force lower due to smaller vertical projection; node_3-node_4=sqrt((2.6-2)^2+ (2.5-0)^2)=2.52 shorter vertical arm improving moment balance. Mass estimations critical but likely still under allowed mass (<30), also stress in member_5 may reduce from 29 to about 25 by better force distribution. Areas assignment: keep member_5 area at '2'(0.782) instead of '1' (0.195) to ensure allowable stress with less risk; reduce member_4 area to '2'(0.782) or '1' balancing stress and mass. Overall, expect stress reduced to about 25 max and total mass roughly close or less than current 15.75. This is feasible improvement and warrants iteration continuation.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Ensure no overlaps of nodes or members, closed truss maintained, supports/load nodes unmodified, assigning new areas respecting mass constraints, confirming max stress<30 and total mass<30 before next iteration or termination. Bias small node_4 move right and down to reduce member_5 tension stress.",
