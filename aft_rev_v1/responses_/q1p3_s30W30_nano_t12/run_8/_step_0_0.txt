  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to minimize stress, keep within stress ±30 and mass ≤30 with fixed node positions/load/supports.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given 3 nodes: node_1 (0,0, pinned), node_2 (6,0, roller), node_3 (2,0) with load (-10 at -45°). Need closed truss with all connected nodes, minimal stress, and mass ≤30. Areas range from 0.195 to 19.548. Aim to use minimal member area and length while controlling stress.",
  
  "analysis": "The current nodes nearly lie on the x-axis except node_3. Load at node_3 has both horizontal and vertical component from -10 N at -45°. A closed truss means triangular connectivity among nodes is simplest (node_1-node_2-node_3). To resist the diagonal load, cross members form triangle edges: (1-3), (3-2), (1-2). Supports are pinned and roller; so structure stable. Stress limits ±30, mass max 30 = sum(length*area) ≤ 30. Longer members with small area preferred to reduce mass, but area needed to reduce stress below ±30. Use static equilibrium to solve internal forces",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Current node distances: 1-2 =6.0, 1-3 =2.0, 2-3 ≈4.472. Mass minimal if area is smallest possible but must keep stress ≤30. Calculate member forces assuming nodes at given coords and equilibrium at node3 with external load.",
  
  "reasoning": "A triangle is minimum closed structure here. Assign members: member_1 (1-3), member_2 (3-2), member_3 (1-2). Forces in members come from equilibrium at loaded node and supports. Resolve load at node_3 into components: Fx = -10*cos(45°)= -7.071 N, Fy = -10*sin(45°)= -7.071 N (down and left). Using method of joints at node_3 to calculate member forces. Select minimum cross-sectional areas from discrete set that maintain forces stress ≤30, with stress = force / area, where force is absolute member axial force. Mass sum(length*area) ≤ 30.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Compute member lengths: L13=2.0, L32= sqrt((6-2)^2 + 0^2)=4.0, L12=6.0. Check forces at node 3 for equilibrium Fx, Fy: sum of member force components + external load=0. Approximate member force in 1-3 and 3-2 with angles along member lines. Use sine and cosine projections. Calculate forces. Select areas strategically.",
  
  "calculation": "Resolve load F3 = (-7.071, -7.071). Members at node3: 1-3 (horizontal direction, vector from node1 to node3 is (2,0)), 3-2 vector is (4,0). Both members along x-axis? Correction: node3 = (2,0), node2 = (6,0) so vector 3-2 is horizontal, same as 1-3. Problem: All nodes are colinear on x-axis at y=0. A closed truss by triangle not planar here. To form a closed triangle, node_3 must be off x-axis. Given constraints say positions of nodes fixed. Since node_3 at (2,0), colinear with others, a closed planar triangle impossible; so create a new node off x-axis for closure without breaking instructions by re-examining input. Instruction#: 5 states fixed node positions for load and supports nodes but does not forbid adding new nodes. To form closed truss, must add node_4 off axis to close truss triangularly. Maintain existing node positions for requested nodes. So add node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) for height.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Calculate length of new members: 3-4 = 3.0m, 1-4 = sqrt((2-0)^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(4+9) = 3.6056, 2-4 = sqrt((6-2)^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(16+9) = 5.0 approx. Triangulate between nodes 1,3,4 and 2,3,4 and base 1-2. Calculate forces from joint equilibrium and pick areas to keep stress ≤ 30. Use minimal area for base 1-2 as compression moderate, small area for vertical or angled members where forces less, higher area for loaded members around node_3.",
