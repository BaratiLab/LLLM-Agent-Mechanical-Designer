  "preamble": "Current 2D truss complies with constraints with margin, further stress reduction unlikely.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 13.06 MPa well below 30 MPa limit; mass 22.56 under max 30. All node supports respected. Only movable node is node_4 (load and support fixed).",
  "analysis": "The critical tensile stress (-13.06) lies in member_5 which is a diagonal. Current member areas (2 and 3) are moderate. Node_4 placement balanced vertically at 3.0m, aligns structure well without overstress. Adding members or drastically changing geometry risks exceeding mass or adds complexity.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Areas correspond roughly to intermediate and larger cross sections. Member sheathings close to minimum for load. Small changes in node_4 vertical coordinate may not improve stress while respecting constraints.",
  "reasoning": "Member stresses are well below thresholds. Mass is also comfortably below max. Current design uses efficient triangulated form between supports and load point. Relocating node_4 slightly horizontally nearer load node_3 would risk increasing compression members lengths and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member stresses range between -13 and +7. Margins are approx 50% to 70% from limits. With reasonable geometries and current member areas, no large gain expected from repositioning node_4, rather minimal.",
  "calculation": "Continuing to reposition node_4 was computed for minimal stress, but found no meaningful decrease without compromising mass or topology imperatives. Area assignments 2 and 3 suitable for mid range stresses. Mass sum confirmed below limit.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Current design geometry optimal given constraints. No support leaves, stabilizes and satisfies. Further optimization indicated as superfluous.",
