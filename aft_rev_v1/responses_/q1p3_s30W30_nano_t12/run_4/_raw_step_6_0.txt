Node 6 adjusted from previous positions, members mostly area_id \'2\' and \'3\'.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Stress is already well below limit ±30, but compressive stress in member_1 (-19.81) is notable. Mass is acceptable but relatively high at 24.68. Area selections for members 5 and 7 are at \'3\' (1.759 cross-section), which contributes to mass. Current configuration is stable and feasible. Beneficial to refine node_6 position slightly upward and left to better balance load path to reduce max stress further, rebalance area assignments to slightly smaller where stress relaxes, targeting lower max stress and reduced mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider slight displacement of node_6 from (3.4,1.8) toward (3.2,1.65) to optimize axis force distributions. Experiment decreasing area in less stressed members to \'1\' or \'0\' to reduce mass without exceeding stress limits.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Reducing area in members with low stress margin reduces mass. Better geometry (node_6 shifted) shortens compression and tension forces (member_1 compressive), reducing member force magnitude. Avoid decreasing area in highest stress members (eg. member_1 area \'2\'). Members 3,4 area reduce from \'2\' to \'1\' possible due to low stresses. Members 7 and 5 could reduce area from \'3\' to \'2\'.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Current max_stress = 19.81 < 30; total mass 24.68 < 30. Propose node_6 to (3.27, 1.65).

Recalculate estimated mass and stress reduction to ensure constraints remain.
