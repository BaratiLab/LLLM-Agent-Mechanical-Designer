  "preamble": "Refine node 6 position and re-assign areas to reduce max stress below current 19.81, keeping mass below 30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 19.81 well below limits; mass 24.68 is within 30. Node 6 adjusted from previous positions, members mostly area_id '2' and '3'.",
  
  "analysis": "Stress is already well below limit ±30, but compressive stress in member_1 (-19.81) is notable. Mass is acceptable but relatively high at 24.68. Area selections for members 5 and 7 are at '3' (1.759 cross-section), which contributes to mass. Current configuration is stable and feasible. Beneficial to refine node_6 position slightly upward and left to better balance load path to reduce max stress further, rebalance area assignments to slightly smaller where stress relaxes, targeting lower max stress and reduced mass.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider slight displacement of node_6 from (3.4,1.8) toward (3.2,1.65) to optimize axis force distributions. Experiment decreasing area in less stressed members to '1' or '0' to reduce mass without exceeding stress limits.",
  
  "reasoning": "Reducing area in members with low stress margin reduces mass. Better geometry (node_6 shifted) shortens compression and tension forces (member_1 compressive), reducing member force magnitude. Avoid decreasing area in highest stress members (eg. member_1 area '2'). Members 3,4 area reduce from '2' to '1' possible due to low stresses. Members 7 and 5 could reduce area from '3' to '2'.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current max_stress = 19.81 < 30; total mass 24.68 < 30. Propose node_6 to (3.27, 1.65). Adjust member areas: members_3,4 area from '2' to '1'; member_7 from '3'(1.759) to '2'(0.782); member_5 from '3' to '2'. Recalculate estimated mass and stress reduction to ensure constraints remain. Expect at least 10-15% mass saving and stress from better load distribution, reducing member_1 tension.",
  
  "calculation": "Member length approx: member_1 (node_1 to node_3) = 2.0; member_3(node_1 to node_4)=3.0; current members_3,4 lengths about 3 to 3.2, lowering area halves mass approx.  Members_5 and 7 length ~distance between positioned nodes ~1.8 likely decreased by node_6 downward shift. Mass reduces by ~2-3, max stress expected reduced by about 3 due to optimized geometry, all within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Adopt new node_6 position and lowered areas; verify no member stress >±30; sum member mass <30; no change to constrained nodes node_1, node_2, node_3 positions; preserve truss closure; no duplicate nodes or members.",
