  "preamble": "Optimize node_6 position and reconsider area sizes to reduce max stress while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress is 20.19 < 30, total_mass 13.9 < 30; load at node_3, supports fixed—need to reduce max stress further with minimal mass increase.",
  
  "analysis": "Members connected to node_6 experience varying stress; members_1 and 4 have moderate tensile stresses (6.37, 10.95). Heaviest stress member_7 (11.13 tensile) is 'node_1'-'node_6', area '2'(0.782). Could shift node_6 slightly to balance stress distribution, reduce stress concentrations. Use areas strategically considering node pairs.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Minimal node moves allowed on node_6 (currently at (3.27,1.65)); Aim to raise y slightly to increase vertical component in truss to lower axial loads. Modify member areas: heavier members bearing higher stress may increase area, low stress reduced back to area '1' or maintain '2' to save mass.",
  
  "reasoning": "By shifting node_6 up and slightly left (~3.15,1.85), can reduce compressive stress in members 1 and 5. Adjust member_7 area (node_1-node_6) from 2(0.782) to 1(0.195) for slight mass reduction since stress in it is moderate. Increase area for critical member_3 from 1 to 2 to enhance stiffness near node_4 and node_1 connection.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths: node_1 (0,0) to node_6 (3.15,1.85) ~ 3.65; node_3 (2,0) to node_6 (3.15,1.85) ~ 2.13; adjusted areas impact mass ~ Σ(length*area). Adjust to keep mass under 30 and stress maximal < 20.",
  
  "calculation": "Total mass recalculated with adjusted area sets and node_6 repositioned: Expect slight increase in member_3 mass and possibly reduce member_7 mass. Anticipate max stress decrease to ~17-18 MPa. Total mass ~14-15 keeping under limit constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "No new nodes, no changing load/support nodes. Member connections kept unchanged, only areas updated and node_6 moved slightly with higher precision placement for stress relief. Check for duplicate members - none, unique nodes - valid.",
