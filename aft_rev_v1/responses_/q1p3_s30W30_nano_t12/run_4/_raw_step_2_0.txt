Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Current max stress 30.93 slightly above limit, mass 8.35 well below max 30. Stress critical on member_7 (node_1-node_5). Node_5 added in iteration_1 to reduce member_3 overstress from last iteration.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current max stress slightly exceeds limit on member_7 with area=1. Member_7 length is short (~distance node_1[0,0] to node_5[2.5,1.8]). Current design insufficient in force redistribution; member area only varied in small increments (areas 1 or 2). Adding one additional node near load point to improve load path redistribution may reduce peak stresses. Increase cross sections in high-stress members combined with optimal triangulation will aid.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Members adjacent to node_5 show tension and compression, redistributing stresses finer. Elevating node_5 slightly and adding node_6 near node_4 with connection to node_5 to create tri-spoke triangulation could further reduce stress concentrations. Important to keep node_1 and node_2 fixed. Use area group codes 2+ and possibly 3+ for members close to supports and under tension.",\n\n    "proposal": "Add a node_6 at (3.2, 2.1) between node_4 and node_5; this reinforces top triangle. Connect node_6 with node_5 (area=2), node_6 with node_4 (area=2), and node_6 with node_3 (area=1). Upgrade areas on high stress members: member from node_1-node_5 to area 3, node_5-node_4 and node_5-node_3 keep 2. Members from node_2-node_4 upgraded to area 2 to carry load. Keep base members from node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2 at area 2. Remove longest high stress member if redundancy added by node_6 members lowers loads.",\n   \n    "reasoning": "Current design has stress near limit on member_7 (node_1-node_5). Increasing its area from 1 to 3 reduces stress by ~ 40% approximately. Addition of node_6 introduces better force resolution in triangulation top portion and improves load path from node_3 downward. This would reduce force magnitude and stress intensity in few critical members. Member areas chosen from allowed discrete areas nearby to original.
