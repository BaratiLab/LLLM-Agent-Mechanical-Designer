Increasing area there from 1 to higher reduces stress but increases mass, careful balance needed. Members 3 & 4 at force transfer from support to loaded zone require better load path. Position of node_4 (3.0, 2.7) creates length and slightly suboptimal angle, contributing to high tensile stress in member_3. Adding one intermediate node connecting load node_3 with top node_4 could improve load distribution. Member_5 (node_3-node_4) at area 2 is critical in tension, slight increase could help. Areas should be adjusted to reduce stress concentration.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "- Member_3 tensile stress > limit; optimize area or shorten or better load transfer.\\n- Add node_5 near (2.5, 1.8) to divide diagonal tension path.\\n- Increase area on risky members modestly; reduce area on less stressed to control mass.\\n- Maintain fixed nodes node_1 (0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0) as per constraints.\\n- Total mass comfortably beneath max of 30; room to increase some members\' areas.\\n- Member length calc needed to verify mass.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (2.5,1.8).

Using intermediate node_5 deals better with diagonal tension path and reduces member stress. Keeping roller/pinned supports intact respects boundary conditions. Adjusting areas matching member forces optimizes mass and stress efficiency. Use higher area for bottom chord members bearing more compressive or tensile load.
