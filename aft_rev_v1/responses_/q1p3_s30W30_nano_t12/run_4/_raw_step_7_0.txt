Heaviest stress member_7 (11.13 tensile) is \'node_1\'-\'node_6\', area \'2\'(0.782). Could shift node_6 slightly to balance stress distribution, reduce stress concentrations. Use areas strategically considering node pairs.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Minimal node moves allowed on node_6 (currently at (3.27,1.65)); Aim to raise y slightly to increase vertical component in truss to lower axial loads.
