Members with high stresses and small cross-sections are members 4(area=1),7(1). Modestly sized members for load paths but some member areas minimal (area 1) causing higher stresses. Node_6 at [3.0,1.5] central. Current layout is simple, closed truss with 6 nodes and 8 members, enough geometric stability.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress, increase cross sectional area of high stress members or redistribute load by relocating node_6 where force paths more direct and force flows on longer legs less bending. Stress correlates with member force / area and length. Changing node_6 position along the vertical axis modestly reduces force concentrations. Examine also changing member_4 area from 1 to 2 or 3 to reduce stress but increases mass. Better: relocate node_6 to optimize geometry reducing moment/forces at members 4 and 7.",\n  "reasoning": "Node_6 can only move, supports and loads fixed. To reduce stress in member 4 and 7, adjust node_6 closer to line node_1-node_2 but slightly offset vertically to maintain stability and open stress path. Choose node_6 around x=3, y~1.3 (lower than 1.5), members become shorter or closer to force direction, reducing bending stress and demand on these members. Keep member area pattern as similar but increase area for member_7 from 1 to 2 to marginally reduce max stress by increasing area in critical member at minor mass penalty (~0.65 to ~1.3). Member_4 area can remain at 1 because its stress is slightly lower and its length short.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check members_par: areas selected 1=0.195,2=0.782; move node_6 from (3,1.5) to approx (3,1.3). member_7 area from \'1\'=0.195 to \'2\'=0.782, increase cross section; member_4 stays at \'1\'. Increased area on member_7 reduces stress by factor area ratio~4.0, estimated max stress after area change ~21.3*0.195/0.782 ≈ 5.3 improved well below constraints. Small node move reduces bending & force concentrations in members 4 and 7; small increase in mass acceptable (current 13.976). All constraints remain met.",\n  "calculation": "Node_6 relocation: from (3.0,1.5) to (3.0,1.3). Member_7 area change: from \'1\' to \'2\' meaning factor 0.195→0.782 (x4 approx area). Result: expected max stress reduction on member_7 ~1/4. Other member stresses slightly decrease due to geometry improvement. Mass increase: approx member_7 current mass 0.654 increases by factor 4, new ~2.6 mass. Total mass rises ~2 from old 13.976 to about 15.9 <30 acceptable.
