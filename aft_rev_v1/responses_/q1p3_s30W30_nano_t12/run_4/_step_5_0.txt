  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under load with max stress ±30 and mass ≤30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 (-10 at -45°), supports pinned at node_1 & roller at node_2, current max stress 40.31 > 30, mass 23.14 < 30 allowed. Reduce stress primarily at member_5 (-40.31).",
  
  "analysis": "Current design has a very thin member_5 (area_id '1') overloaded in compression (-40.31). Members 3 and 4 with large areas (3) carry low stress indicating inefficiency. Some long, slender members are stressed, mass is below limit but max stress violated. Nodes largely stable on support and load placement.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Strategy: Reduce stress in member_5 by providing more load path, redesign triangulation near node_3 and node_4. Possibly remove node_5, reposition/load the intermediate node closer to line between node_3 and node_4, use balanced triangulation to distribute load, adjust cross sections upwards where stress is high, lower them where underutilized.",
  
  "proposal": "Remove node_5 to simplify structure, reposition node_6 closer between nodes 3 & 4 at higher y for better force distribution. Introduce new triangulated members from node_3 and node_6 to node_4 to create stable truss. Use areas to keep mass low but upgrade members under high stress. Updated member areas allocated to balance tensile and compression better.",
  
  "reasoning": "Removing node_5 removes the weak segment with overstress. Lifting node_6 to (3.4,1.8) reduces long slender lower chord members, enhancing stiffness around node_3. Adding new member from node_3 to node_6 stiffens lower region. Members 1 and 2 area remain same due to load path importance. Members 3,4 area reduced to '2' for less mass but enough stiffness. Heavier sections used in compression chords near supports as typical in trusses.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Focus molecular treatment:\n- Check member lengths to estimate approximate forces\n- Member_5 replaced by direct member_3 to node_6, node_6 to node_4\n- Assign cross sections: high areas (3) for main chords, medium (2) for diagonal tension/compression\n- Total mass reassessed less than 30\n- Stress checks coherent with load and supports to satisfy constraint.",
  
  "calculation": "Lengths (approx):\nmember_1 (0-2,0): 2.0;\nmember_2 (2,0-6,0):4.0;\nmember_3(0,0-3,2.5):~3.0;\nmember_4(6,0-3,2.5):~3.0;\nmember_5(new node_3 to node_6(3.4,1.8)): distance ~2.22;\nmember_6(node_6 to node_4): distance ~1.0;\nmember_7(node_1 to node_6): ~3.48;\nmember_8(node_6 to node_2): ~2.69\nCalculate member masses and keep total <30 by areas chosen.\nExpected stress drop in diagonals and central chords due to improved geometry and increased cross-section in critical members.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes or members, no change to fixed nodes, validate areas in given range, mass ≤30, stress ≤30 both tension and compression.",
