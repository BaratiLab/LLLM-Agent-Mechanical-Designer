  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under given loads and supports within stress ±30 and mass ≤30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Assess initial design stress overshoot (36.14 > 30), mass (8.5176 < 30). Aim to reduce max stress by adjusting geometry, areas or adding nodes.",
  
  "analysis": "Current max stress at member_3 (node_1-node_4) is 36.14 > 30 limit. Increasing area there from 1 to higher reduces stress but increases mass, careful balance needed. Members 3 & 4 at force transfer from support to loaded zone require better load path. Position of node_4 (3.0, 2.7) creates length and slightly suboptimal angle, contributing to high tensile stress in member_3. Adding one intermediate node connecting load node_3 with top node_4 could improve load distribution. Member_5 (node_3-node_4) at area 2 is critical in tension, slight increase could help. Areas should be adjusted to reduce stress concentration.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "- Member_3 tensile stress > limit; optimize area or shorten or better load transfer.\n- Add node_5 near (2.5, 1.8) to divide diagonal tension path.\n- Increase area on risky members modestly; reduce area on less stressed to control mass.\n- Maintain fixed nodes node_1 (0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0) as per constraints.\n- Total mass comfortably beneath max of 30; room to increase some members' areas.\n- Member length calc needed to verify mass.",
  
  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (2.5,1.8). Connect members: node_1-node_5 (area 1), node_5-node_4 (area 2), node_3-node_5 (area 2). Remove member_3 (node_1-node_4). Keep others. Areas adjusted: member_1: area 2; member_2: area 2; member_4: area 1; member_5 (node_3-node_5): area 2; new members as stated.",
  
  "reasoning": "Splitting the diagonal member with two shorter members redistributes forces, lowering max tensile stress on long member_3 now removed. Using intermediate node_5 deals better with diagonal tension path and reduces member stress. Keeping roller/pinned supports intact respects boundary conditions. Adjusting areas matching member forces optimizes mass and stress efficiency. Use higher area for bottom chord members bearing more compressive or tensile load. Loosen members in low-stress areas reduce weight. Geometry changes improve load transfer angles reducing critical tension in diagonal members.",
