Fixed load/support node positions: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0). Member areas mostly area_id=2 (0.782) and some area_id=1 (0.195).",\n  "analysis": "Max stress is 20.01 (below ±30 max). Total mass 15.8419 << 30 max. Minor stresses are fairly distributed. Load node at node_3 fixed (2,0); adjusting node_6 in [3,1.3] maintains closed truss. Current member areas are reasonable with no overstressed members. Node_4(3.0,2.5) and node_6(3.0,1.3) support compressive and tensile loads evenly.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Earlier iterations showed mass tradeoffs with area increase but max stress tended to increase past limit. Current structure well balanced. Stress elimination or significant reduction likely requires mass or node radical reposition, breaking load/support constraints.",\n  "reasoning": "Further stress reduction would require either increasing areas (increasing mass) or adjusting unidentified internal node positions. Due to load/support constraints and fixed external nodes, small displacements do not substantially reduce max stress below current 20.0. Areas already selected minimize mass under stress limits. Thus, optimization plateau reached in current design iteration.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "No new nodes are needed; current six nodes with explicit member connectivity ensure structure closure. Member area increasing only increases mass without critical stress reduction benefit. Node_6 lowered from 1.5 to 1.3 previously yielded stress decrease, currently optimized position for balanced force flow.",\n  "calculation": "Several design trials in history increased stressing members or mass without significant benefit. All member stresses within ±30, most below ±25. Total mass about half max allowed (30). Length-mass-area correlation consistent; mass minimum with given nodal geometry and area assignments.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Output final stable structure matching last iteration node positions, members, and areas.
