Load: single node_3 force (-10, -45 degrees). Supports: pinned node_1, roller node_2. Nodes fixed for supports and load. Can add/move others for optimal load paths and member sizes.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current max stress member_7 (node_1-node_6) tensile ~39.9 >30 limit indicates highly loaded member. Mass is below limit but members with smaller area still experience overstress. No redundancy to distribute load optimally; some members oversized (area 3) causing higher mass. Member_6 and member_8 are small areas undercompression — there might be better topology reducing high stress concentrations by relocating node_6 and adding node or modifying connections.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce stress peak by adjusting topology and member sizing. Adding node between node_4 and node_2 can redirect load. Reposition node_6 for better force distribution. Propose adding one mid-upper node to reduce tension at member_7 and length reduce oversized elements. Optimize member areas for balanced stress close but under ±30. Minimum members for stability with planned connections to reduce load on node_1-node_6 member overly stressed.",\n\n  "proposal": "Maintain fixed load/support nodes. Add new node_5 near load node_3 but slightly raised vertically for better force path (e.g. x=2.8, y=1.75). Connect new node_5 with nodes_1, 3, 4, and 6, create triangle and diagonal braces. Reposition node_6 slightly down and more right (e.g. x=3.6, y=1.3) closer to node_2 to share compression paths. Reduce area of member_7 and reassign a larger area for critical compression members distributing load. Adjust areas per member to reduce peak stresses <30 and keep total mass ≤30.",\n\n  "reasoning": "The high tensile stress at (node_1-node_6) indicates this member acts as main tension tie. By introducing an additional intermediate node (node_5) near load node_3 but elevated, the load is better channeled and spread across multiple members, reducing peak tension. Repositioning node_6 towards node_2 increases load sharing of diagonal compression paths, decreasing stress in the risky member. Maintaining pinned/roller supports as is and using multiple short spanning members reduces slenderness and stress amplification. Assigning areas from available discrete values optimize material use perfectly within mass limit. Member areas chosen to keep stress ≤30, with larger areas on more loaded members and smaller on lightly loaded, efficiently balancing performance and weight.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Compute lengths for all members, estimate axial force using force equilibrium on nodes with known loads. Assign member area IDs to achieve max stresses ≤30: σ = force / area ≤ 30 hence area = force / 30 approx, select nearest available area from given discrete areas per member. Calculate mass = sum(length * area) verify ≤ 30. Check member stresses with new areas and geometry to confirm constraints satisfied.",\n\n  "calculation": "Node coordinates (with reason): node_1(0.0, 0.0) pinned, node_2(6.0,0.0) roller, node_3(2.0,0.0) load.
