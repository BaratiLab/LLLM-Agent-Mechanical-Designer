  "preamble": "Refine node_6 positioning to further minimize max stress staying within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given max stress ~26.68 and mass 14.04 well below limits, focus on stress reduction. Load/support nodes fixed (node_1,node_2,node_3). Node_4 and node_6 adjustable. Members mostly area '2' or '1', area changes may be risky on minimal mass. Node_6 can be moved slightly to alleviate peak stress (member_7 has 26.68, just below 30).",
  
  "analysis": "Max compressive and tensile stresses have margin (~3.3 below allowable 30). Highest tensile stress on member_7 (node_1-node_6 area '1'), positional change of node_6 closer to node_1 or slightly down can reduce axial stress magnitude there. Member masses suggest no major mass changes possible without replacing areas. Maintain current member connectivity to keep closed truss and constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_6 slightly down and left (x from 3.12 to ~3.0, y from 1.7 to ~1.5) to reduce tensile stress in member_7 by decreasing its length/stretch, and better distribute internal forces.",
  
  "reasoning": "High stress usually due to geometry causing excessive load on certain members. Adjusting node_6 position changes member_6, member_5, member_7, member_8 lengths and angles. Minor shifts to node_6 to reduce stress in member_7 while monitoring stress redistribution to others. Node_4 fixed at y=2.5 to maintain structure height and symmetric placement with node_6",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_7 highest stress is tensile at 26.68 with area '1' (0.195) mass per unit length. No need to enlarge area, but improve member force distribution. Changing node_6 from (3.12,1.7) to approx (3.0,1.5) shortens member_7 slightly, should reduce max tensile stress on it. Ensure members remain within max area sizes and constraints.",
  
  "calculation": "Moving node_6 left by 0.12m and down by 0.2m,\nNode_6 new pos: x=3.0, y=1.5\nCheck member lengths:\n- member_7 length reduced from ~3.22m to ~3.04m (reduces tensile force)\n- member_6 and member_5 lengths adjust less substantially\nPredicted max stress drop by 1-2 units within margin.\nMass roughly unchanged since areas unchanged.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Validate no overload on other members, total mass below 30 constraint satisfied. Max stress likely < 26.68 after adjustment. Node_6 move complies with node movement rules. Member_7 length reduced, stress distribution improved.",
