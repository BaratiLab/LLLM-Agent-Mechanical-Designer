Existing max stress 46.99 > 30 allowed, mass 17.1 < 30 allowed. Need to reduce stress spikes and balance mass.",\n    "analysis": "Current design has an overloaded member_5 (node_1 to node_4) under tension ~47, over limit of 30, indicating fiber cross-sectional area not sufficient or force path inefficient. Members to ground supports not balanced. Structure is minimal with node_4 at (2.5,1.5), triangle largely unoptimized. Load at node_3 causes bi-axial stresses hard to resolve with small member arrangement. Member length and area choice is suboptimal causing excessive stresses in few members.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress: add an intermediate node higher than node_4 to form more triangular braces and distribute load paths. Larger area in highly loaded members helps reduce stress. Remove or substitute member with area 1 to area 2 or 3 at key points. Consider adding node near middle between node_3 and node_4 to relieve stress in member_5. Restrict adding nodes within 0 < x < 6 and y >0.0. Constraint max mass allows some heavier members.",\n    "proposal": "Add node_5 at (3.2, 2.3) to create additional load path. Add members from node_5 to nodes 4 and 2, forming more triangular sub-structures. Use areas strategically: increase critical members to area \'3\' or \'4\' to reduce stress, keep less loaded members area \'1\' or \'2\'. Keep existing load & support nodes fixed as per constraints. Remove member_5 and substitute with two members from node_1 to node_4 (area \'2\') and node_4 to new node_5 (area \'2\'). Reconnect node_3 to node_4 and node_5 with area \'3\'. This triangulates the top efficiently and distributes stresses. Verify total mass under 30 and max stress within ±30 MPa.",\n    "reasoning": "Adding a fifth node forming adjacent triangles increases structural redundancy and stiffness, lowering peak stresses in members. Upgrading area from \'1\' to \'3\' or \'4\' in main load bearing members helps not exceed stress limits. Node placement allowed only except loads/support nodes, so only node_5 added. Mass limit permits heavier areas. Member stresses relate inversely to sectional areas; increasing critical members area reduces stress. Shorter members in tension/compression see less stress, so positioning node_5 above node_4 helps. Members connecting load node_3 to bracing nodes will carry less load individually.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: node_1->node_3=2.0, node_3->node_4= approx 1.581, node_4->node_2= approx 3.354, node_3->node_2= 4.0, node_1->node_4= approx 2.915, node_4->node_5= approx 0.943, node_5->node_2= approx 1.802\\nAreas chosen: members on higher stresses \'3\' or \'4\', lighter members on less load \'1\' or \'2\'.
