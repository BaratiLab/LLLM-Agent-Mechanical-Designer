Load -10 at 45° downward at node_3. Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Need a closed truss, all nodes connected. Choose members and cross-sectional areas from given discrete areas. Structure must sustain load with stresses ±30 limit, and keep total mass ≤30.",\n\n    "analysis": "Minimizing stress involves distributing forces via triangulation. Currently all nodes are colinear, no triangular formation. Add node(s) above to form a triangle network. Load applied at middle node down-left direction. Use aligned triangles for stiffness. Constraints advise using smaller areas where possible to keep mass low. Members mainly under axial forces; we use length × area as proxy for mass. Stress assumed avg: Force / (Area × yield strength approximated). Given no yield specified, we use stress as axial force / area. We aim to balance forces to keep stresses within ±30 and total mass under limit.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Add a node_4 above (2.6667,1.5) to provide triangulation.

Step 4: Approximate forces from load -10 at 45° on node_3 to members linked to node_3; forces will roughly distribute through connected members to supports node_1& node_2. Step 5: Assume max tensile/compressive force near or below 600 (stress 30 × area 0.2) approximate with area chosen accordingly. Step 6: Select area sizes targeting minimal mass.
