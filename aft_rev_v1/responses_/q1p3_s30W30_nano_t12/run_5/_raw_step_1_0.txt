Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current max stress 49.31 > 30 limit, mass 6.32 < 30. Need to reduce max stress by geometry or member area changes.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High tensile stress on member_3 (node_1-node_4) causes max stress violation at 49.31. Also, high compression on member_5 (node_3-node_4) at -39.68, and near-limit stress on member_4 (node_4-node_2) at 29.45. The node_4 height and position simplifies a triangular shape but stressed regions need more support or redistribution. Mass is under limit, so area increase possible to reduce stress but that increases mass. Another approach is re-positioning node_4 higher and shifting load path more symmetrically and redistributing members",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_4 vertically higher and slightly toward center to reduce stress concentration. Add or reinforce members to redistribute load. Possibly add another node above node_3 or between node_3 and node_4 for better force paths. Member areas: choose larger in highly loaded compression/tension (up to 4). Keep low areas in tension members with low stress.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 at x=2.8333333333, y=2.5 (above node_4). Modify node_4 y to 2.0 (raise 0.5). Modify members such that node_5 connects to node_4, node_3, and node_2. Remove member_5 (node_3-node_4). Modify members_3 and _4 to be smaller area (some reduction). Add new members from node_5 for load redistribution. Adjust member areas optimizing stress below ±30 and total mass < 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing vertical height and adding node_5 allows longer diagonal transfer path for applied load, reducing stress concentration on low truss members. This creates multiple load paths improving stability and decreasing peak stresses. Removing member_5 reduced highly stressed compression component. Area allocation according to stress levels optimizes mass. Node positions fixed for load and support; flexible intermediate nodes let structure better absorb bending moments.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Length calculations for new members based on node coords. Areas use provided discrete levels. Estimated bending forces reduced by taller truss and added nodes.
