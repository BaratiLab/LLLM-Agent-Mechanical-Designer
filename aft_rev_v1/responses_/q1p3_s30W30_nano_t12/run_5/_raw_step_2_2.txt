Loads apply at node_3 down-left. Supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller fixed. Keeping supports and load nodes fixed. Current max stress ~38.2 exceeds limit; mass 21.16 is within limit, but some members are over-stressed which requires redesign and redistribution of axial forces. Node_4 and node_5 provide support for load transfer but heavily stressed members around node_5 must be relieved.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design uses two intermediate nodes (node_4 and node_5). Members between node_4-node_5 and node_5-node_3 experience stress above 30. Large areas (3) on long diagonals increase mass disproportionately and don\'t relieve stress effectively. Member_5 and member_7 almost hit stress limits but in tension/compression oppositely, indicating inefficient self-equilibrating triangular topology. Member areas assigned suboptimally—too small on high-stress members, causing stress exceedance. Member connections can be modified to avoid redundancy and to provide direct, effective load path while minimizing member lengths and reducing mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Need to add or reposition nodes above node_3 to better distribute force, increase connectivity to share load paths, weaken over-stressed members with higher area, remove redundant members contributing to mass but little stress alleviation, and consider a simpler truss with effectively triangulated load transfer paths. Let\'s try 3 nodes: keep node_4 near vertical over node_3 and add node_5 slightly shifted toward load direction for force dispersal. Members from supports and node_3 to these nodes to increase load transfer paths.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Final node_dict: keep existing nodes for load/support (node_1, node_2, node_3). Add new nodes node_4 and node_5: node_4 at (2.0, 1.6); node_5 at (3.5, 1.0). Members: node_1 to node_3 and node_4, node_2 to node_3 and node_5, node_3 to node_4 and node_5, node_4 to node_5, node_4 to node_2. Area assignments to optimize stress: use area 4 (3.128) on members from supports to intermediate nodes, area 3 (1.759) on intermediate members, and area 2 (0.782) or 1 (0.195) on less stressed members. Avoid redundant members and ensure continuous triangulation.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Positions of node_4 and node_5 place them to form triangles sampling load downward and translating it to supports efficiently with shorter members. Increasing areas on support brace members reduces peak stress. Reducing or removing high-stress, low-area members avoids over-stressing. Geometry is simplified and optimized to reduce member lengths and mass while fitting forces effectively within limits.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths using Euclidean distance, assign areas, then sum mass = Σ(length × area_value). Check stress feasibility based on load paths, justify no overload >30. Triangulation assures stability and load sharing, avoiding direct long span tensile links with too high stress. Connect node_4 to node_2, forming bracket to ally loads. No redundant cross members to avoid excess mass.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node lengths and member forces estimated approximately:\\n- L(m_1 node_1-node_3): 2m, area 3 => mass 2*1.759=3.518\\n- L(m_2 node_3-node_4): 1.6m, area 3 => mass 4.454\\n- L(m_3 node_1-node_4): ~1.920m, area 4 => mass ~6.0\\n- L(m_4 node_4-node_5): ~1.581m, area 2 => mass ~1.237\\n- L(m_5 node_3-node_5): ~1.802m, area 2 => mass ~1.41\\n- L(m_6 node_5-node_2): ~2.690m, area 4 => mass ~8.41\\n- L(m_7 node_4-node_2): ~3.240m, area 3 => mass ~5.70\\nTotal mass ~30.7 marginally near limit, selective area relaxing may reduce.\\nExpected stress is balanced without overshooting ±30 per member due to triangulated load path and member sizing.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_final": "Structure optimized with 2 intermediate nodes repositioned for effective load transfer.
