  "preamble": "Current 2D truss satisfies constraints with acceptable stress and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 16.95 within Â±30 limit. Total mass 22.89 <30 limit. Load @ node_3, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design uses efficient layout with internal nodes supporting load dispersal. Areas range moderate to high to address stresses. Members connected to carry compressive and tensile efficiently. Min stresses about 17 which is reasonable with given geometry and loading. Mass utilization moderate, not excessive.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Attempts in prior iterations to reduce stress caused mass increase or violation of stress constraints. Members with zero stress optimized with low area but kept for geometrical stability. Geometry respects support and load constraints effectively.",

  "reasoning": "Further node movements on node_4 and node_5 lead to mostly minimal stress reduction, changes would reduce stress marginally but increase mass or cause stress spikes. Adjusting cross section areas appears balanced now. Structure closed and statically determinate. Load transferred efficiently.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member stresses within limits: [-16.95, +9.94]. Max mass 22.9, far below 30 max. Collateral checks show members 6 and 7 minimal stress zero and small areas, representing potential stiffness members. No redundant members or nodes remain.",

  "calculation": "Verification of mass = sum(length*area_density) confirms 22.8984. With maximum stress well below limit, this design balances load transfer with material use optimally. Minimizing stress below ~17 likely requires disproportionate mass increase or added geometry, violating constraints and optimization goals.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Current structure optimal with node fixed at load/supports, node_4 and node_5 allowing flexibility. Member areas appropriately sized to balance stress avoidance and mass usage. Stop optimization.",
