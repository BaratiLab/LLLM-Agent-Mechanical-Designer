  "preamble": "Current structure meets constraints with low max stress and acceptable mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Constraints max stress ±30, total mass <=30. Current max stress 10.61 well below limit, mass 23.4474 below max.",
  "analysis": "Max stress is significantly below ±30 limit; mass is below 30 max. Members sized with area indices mostly 3 and 4 (mid to high range). Node_6 added at [1.3, 0.9] providing reasonable load path. Stress distribution balanced with no red flags.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further reduction in stress likely requires complex node repositioning or finer area changes that risk increasing mass or violating geometry. Current topology is closed and stable with no redundancy brought by more nodes.",
  "reasoning": "Moving free nodes or changing areas could marginally reduce stresses but gains likely minimal (<10% improvement) given current factors. Load and supports fixed, symmetrical truss with suitable nodal layout. Overoptimization may overcomplicate and add mass.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Members connect key points with adequate stiffness, areas selected are consistently moderate. Max stress occurs in member_6 at -10.61, well within safety margin ±30. Member masses spread evenly, total manageable. Further optimization would be diminishing returns.",
  "calculation": "No explicit equations since current analysis based on given FEM results. Mass is sum(length*area). Max stress safety factor ~30/10.61 ≈2.83. Leave nodes fixed except free nodes; changing them with tentative moves left no better redistributions in previous history.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify constraints: max stress ±30, current 10.61 pass; total mass ≤30, current 23.4474 pass. Structure closed and connected, no duplicate or missing members. Areas valid from given set. Optimization beyond this iteration unlikely to yield significant improvements.",
