  "preamble": "Redesign to reduce peak stresses & under mass limit.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max stress ±30 and mass ≤30; Current max stress ~42 (fail) with mass 10.14 (ok). Loads: downward-left at node_3. Supports pinned and roller at ends node_1 and node_2. Need stronger bracing near node_3 and load node_5 adjustment.",

  "analysis": "Current design over-stressed on member_1 & member_5 connected to node_3 experiencing max compression near -42 with thin cross-section areas (1=0.195 area). Mass well below max, so we should increase cross section at high stress members and reduce member length or increase triangulation to reduce stress. Node_5 position may cause stress concentration between node_1, node_3, and node_4. Presence of slender members creates unstable stress concentrations. The load on node_3 demands strong triangulation to transfer forces. Current members lack optimal geometry for force flow.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Options: 1) move node_5 slightly to increase triangle area around node_3 and node_4; 2) enlarge critical member sections (area ids higher) on highly stressed members; 3) add a new node to redistribute forces; 4) change member connections to avoid redundant members with low stresses; 5) avoid overlong members increasing bending stress.",

  "proposal": "Remove node_5, replace by node_6 closer under node_4 and node_3. Reposition node_4 slightly left to form better triangle. Members: node_1 - node_3 (area 3), node_3 - node_6 (area 3), node_6 - node_4 (area 4), node_4 - node_2 (area 3), node_1 - node_4 (area 3), node_3 - node_2 (area 2). Node positions: node_1 (0.0,0.0), node_2 (6.0,0.0), node_3 (2.0,0.0), node_4 (2.0,1.5), node_6 (1.3,0.9).",

  "reasoning": "Changing node_5 to node_6 closer to load & node_4 results in shorter members with better force distribution both in compression and tension. Increasing cross section on heavily loaded members reduces stress below max ±30 (area ids 3 to 4, mapping to tensile/compressive capacity). Maintaining supports positions per rules. Reduced overlong truss members control buckling. This should lead to mass below 30 and stresses in range.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Length calculations: node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_6 ≈1.17, node_6-node_4 ≈0.85, node_4-node_2 ≈4.0, node_1-node_4 ≈2.69, node_3-node_2 = 4.0. Member areas scaled according to stress demand reducing stress approx linearly with area. Mass=sum(length*area); estimate total mass ~22-23 well under 30. Stress will reduce from ~42*0.195/3=~2.7 factor improved ~15.5 max stress safe.",

  "calculation": "Member lengths x area: m1=2.0*1.759=3.518, m2=1.17*1.759=2.06, m3=0.85*3.128=2.66, m4=4.0*1.759=7.036, m5=2.69*1.759=4.73, m6=4.0*0.782=3.128, summing to ~22.1 mass <30. Stresses scale inversely proportional to area. Highest stress members crowded in m1,m2 -> area 3 reduces stress by factor ~9x compared to thin section 1.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Constraints fulfilled: mass <30 (22.1), max stress expected < ±30 after increasing area. Geometry respected support positions unchanged. Plan improves load transfer with triangular nodes preventing instability and redistribution of extreme stresses. Avoids existing concentrated stress in node_5 members.",
