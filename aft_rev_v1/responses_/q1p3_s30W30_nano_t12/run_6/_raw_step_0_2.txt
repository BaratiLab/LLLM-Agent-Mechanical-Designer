Supports at node_1 fixed pinned and node_2 roller to prevent horizontal and vertical unrestrained displacement respectively. To form a closed truss and effectively resist diagonal load at node_3, need minimal additional node above or near node_3 to create triangular members improving load path and reduce stress. We add a new apex node in positive y-direction (out of base line) connected to base nodes forming collectively multiple triangular elements for stiffness. Members to connect node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2 along baseline and node_1-apex, node_2-apex, node_3-apex. Areas chosen based on member forces to keep ±30 stress, but mass also controlled with shorter member length and smaller cross sectional area where possible. Approximate forces by static equilibrium and simple truss member tension/compression assumptions.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 above node_3 to create multiple triangles (node_1, node_4, node_3) and (node_3, node_4, node_2) ensuring closed truss.

Internal forces divide load\'s horizontal and vertical components in members connected to node_4. Use static equilibrium: sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, sum M=0. Approximating member forces by double triangle truss assumption with large compressive force in struts and tensile force in ties, pick moderate cross-section area to stay within ±30 stress and minimize mass by selecting smallest area satisfying stress ≤ ±30. Member lengths directly computed from coordinates. Mass approximated by sum(length × area_id), with area as the value from given map. Select node_4 around (2.0, 2.0) for effective force distribution without making mass too big by longer members.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Form equilibrium at node_3 under loading: covers equilibrium and internal truss member forces cause by load magnitude F = 10 N vector at 315°(due to -45° direction).

Member forces roughly estimated by method of joints yields member force magnitudes ≤ 30 to keep safe area choice small. Mass = Σ member length × area approx. Use areas 0: 1, 1:0.195, 2:0.782 to 3-5 to fit constraint and stability. Keep member_1 (node_1-node_2) area mid-size as long member handling larger force.

Assume member forces estimated from decomposition of load induced at node_3 and distributed approx: max force in critical members ~ (7 to 20) N (tensile/compressive). Select areas accordingly: use area id \'2\' (0.782) for longer members (node_1-node_2), area \'1\' (0.195) for shorter members to keep mass light. Calculate mass: sum(length x area): (6 x 0.782)=4.692 + (2 x 0.195)=0.39 + (4 x 0.195)=0.78 + (2.828 x 0.195)=0.55 + (4.472 x 0.782)=3.5 + (2 x 0.195)=0.39 total mass approx=10.3 < 30 allowed. Stress approx taken from force/area for max force 20 N and min area 0.195, stress=20/0.195 ≈ 102 - too high. Increase area for critical members: make node_3 to 4 trunk bigger. Assign node_3-node_4 area \'3\' (1.759): 20/1.759=11.37 < 30 stress acceptable. Similarly, larger area for node_1-node_2 \'4\' (3.128) to handle bigger spans and forces.
