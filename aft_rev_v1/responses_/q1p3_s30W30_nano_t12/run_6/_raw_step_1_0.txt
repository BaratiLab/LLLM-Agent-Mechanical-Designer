The large area in member_1 (4) and its large mass (18.768) dominates total mass. Member 2 and 3 areas are low (1) giving high stress. Node_3 is load node at (2,0) and fixed.

Consider lowering area in member_1 to reduce mass or re-allocate. Alternatives: move node_4 slightly to optimize truss angle to reduce max stress on member_2 without increasing mass.",\n  "reasoning": "Member_2 is highly stressed due to load direction and geometry. By moving node_4 nearer horizontally aligned with node_3 but keeping vertical spacing, we can better transfer load via member_4 and 5, reducing tension in member_2. Also reduce member_1 area from 4 to 3. Member_6 area may be raised slightly to take more tensile load to decrease member_2 stress. Preserve closed truss.
