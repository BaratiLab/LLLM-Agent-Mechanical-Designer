Mass 14.47 satisifes mass constraint. Load at node_3, supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Can improve force paths and cross-sectional areas for reduced stress.",\n\n    "analysis": "Member_3 has stress beyond limit potentially due to slender members around node_4 and node_5. Current design uses areas 1 and 2 mostly. Top node_4 at (2.9,3.8) is well placed but members connecting node_4 to node_5 and node_3 bear high stress. The diagonal braces are insufficient to resist load reducing stress levels below constraints. Total mass is within limit, so increasing some member areas moderately is feasible if it reduces peak stress.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on stiffening members around node_4 by improving connectivity, and reposition node_5 closer to node_4 to distribute stresses. Increase critical member areas where compression or tension limits are exceeded. Remove members with negligible effect to save weight.",\n\n    "proposal": "Keep ground nodes and load node fixed. Add node_5 moved upward nearer node_4 at (3.2, 2.5). Connect node_5 to node_2 and node_4 and node_3, with adequate areas. Change member from node_3 to node_4 with a higher area and add a diagonal member from node_1 to node_5 to triangulate structure. Adjust member areas to control stress and mass.",\n\n    "reasoning": "By repositioning node_5 closer to node_4 and enhancing bracing via node_5, we reduce stress concentrations at node_4 and adjacent members. Increasing cross-sectional area of members bearing higher load lowers stress. Triangulation prevents buckling and distributes load evenly.
