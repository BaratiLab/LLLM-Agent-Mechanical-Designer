To resist vertical and horizontal components efficiently and minimize stress, I need to create a triangular truss using given nodes and one new node raised above x-axis to create geometry to transfer vertical load to supports. Closed truss implies polygonal member connection enclosing an area with all nodes connected. Given three existing nodes aligned horizontally, adding an apex node above creates a classic triangular truss, providing geometry for stress distribution.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at position (approx x=2.5, y=3-4), forming a triangle with node_1 and node_2 at base, connected to node_3 (loaded point).

Areas discrete as given, favor smaller where low force expected. Node_3 kept at (2,0). Apex node above for vertical load transfer to supports.
