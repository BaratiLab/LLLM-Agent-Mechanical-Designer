Max stress ±30, max mass ≤ 30. Current structure overshoots stress up to 70.68 and total mass 18.31.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current design has high compressive stresses in members connected to node_5 causing failures. Mass is under limit but stress violations dominate. Member areas mostly moderate. Loads applied induce large axial forces at mid nodes, leading to uneven force transfer and overstress. There is lack of internal bracing and triangulation to reduce member axial force and distribute loads.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding internal nodes near load and between supports for better triangulation. Increase connectivity with diagonal members. Optimize cross-sectional areas; assign larger areas to high force members bearing compression/tension near loads and supports. Reposition internal nodes slightly upward to transfer moment effectively. Use area ids mostly 2 or 3 for moderate load members and limit max areas to reduce mass.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add two new internal nodes: node_5 at (2.5,2.9) and node_6 at (3.8,2.5).

Lower areas at inner diagonals for reducing mass yet still stabilizing structure effectively. Moderate sections at main load paths reflect expected stress demands; larger sections on support to node_4 for moment transfer.
