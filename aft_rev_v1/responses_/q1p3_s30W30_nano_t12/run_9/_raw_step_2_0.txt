Load applied at node_3 down-left (-10 N@-45deg). Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Node_4 at 2.5,3.0 bearing higher compressive stress than allowed, member areas misaligned causing over stress and mass increase.",\n\n    "analysis": "High compressive stress on member_4 (node_3-node_4) exceeds limit (-36.76 > -30); member_2 area increased increased mass significantly but not effective stress-wise. Members near node_3 take high loading causing failure. Current node arrangement with short vertical distance for node_4 and limited triangulation restricts force distribution. Supports node_1 and node_2 well placed but intermediate node_3 position and connection creates stress concentrations.", \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Options: Add node(s) to reduce length and redistribute forces around node_3, reduce area in over designed members and increase in under stressed members with near limits, reposition node_4 slightly upwards to reduce axial compression in member_4.",\n \n    "proposal": "Add a new intermediate node_5 near (3.5, 2.0) to create better force path avoiding overstressing member_4. Increase node_4 height to 3.6 to reduce compression. Revise members to triangulate load paths from node_3 to supports. Use area mapping conservatively staying at or below 3 (1.759) mostly with one higher if needed. Select members between nodes: node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_3, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4 to create stable triangulation with redistributed load paths to reduce member_4 stress and mass.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Adding node_5 creates additional diagonals reducing stress transfer through direct member_4 shortening/compressing. Increasing node_4 vertical coordinate reduces compression by creating more favorable geometry. Properly selecting cross section area per member corresponding to their load demand reduces mass and avoids overdesign. Triangular configurations improve stability and reduce bending moments to primarily axial stresses compliant with allowable stress.", \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Verify force paths and estimate stresses: Lowered compressive force by lengthening node_4 to node_3 segment and splitting horizontal load paths via node_5.
