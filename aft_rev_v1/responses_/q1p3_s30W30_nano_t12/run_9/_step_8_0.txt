  "preamble": "Redesign structure with additional internal nodes and optimized members to meet stress and mass constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Loads: node_3(-10N at -45°), supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Max stress ±30, max mass ≤ 30. Current structure overshoots stress up to 70.68 and total mass 18.31.",

  "analysis": "Current design has high compressive stresses in members connected to node_5 causing failures. Mass is under limit but stress violations dominate. Member areas mostly moderate. Loads applied induce large axial forces at mid nodes, leading to uneven force transfer and overstress. There is lack of internal bracing and triangulation to reduce member axial force and distribute loads.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding internal nodes near load and between supports for better triangulation. Increase connectivity with diagonal members. Optimize cross-sectional areas; assign larger areas to high force members bearing compression/tension near loads and supports. Reposition internal nodes slightly upward to transfer moment effectively. Use area ids mostly 2 or 3 for moderate load members and limit max areas to reduce mass.",

  "proposal": "Add two new internal nodes: node_5 at (2.5,2.9) and node_6 at (3.8,2.5). Maintain support/load nodes fixed. Members: \n- node_1 to node_5 (area 3)\n- node_2 to node_6 (area 3)\n- node_3 to node_5 (area 2)\n- node_3 to node_6 (area 2)\n- node_4 to node_5 (area 1)\n- node_4 to node_6 (area 1)\n- node_5 to node_6 (area 1)\n- node_1 to node_4 (area 2)\n- node_2 to node_4 (area 2)\n- node_3 to node_2 (area 2)\n--- keeping triangulated shape to transfer loads efficiently and reduce peak stresses while controlling member mass.",

  "reasoning": "New internal nodes placed to improve triangulation around load node_3 and to split load transfer path minimizing member stresses. Lower areas at inner diagonals for reducing mass yet still stabilizing structure effectively. Moderate sections at main load paths reflect expected stress demands; larger sections on support to node_4 for moment transfer. Added node_6 reduces span forces from node_3 to node_2.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Estimate member lengths:\n- node_1(0,0) to node_5(2.5,2.9)=≈3.84\n- node_2(6,0) to node_6(3.8,2.5)=≈3.44\n- node_3(2,0) to node_5(2.5,2.9)=≈3.00\n- node_3 to node_6=√(1.8²+2.5²)=3.08\n- node_4(3,3.8) to node_5= approx 1.09\n- node_4 to node_6= approx 1.35\n- node_5 to node_6= √(1.3²+0.4²)=1.36\n- node_1 to node_4=4.76\n- node_2 to node_4=accepted approx 4.19\n- node_3 to node_2=4.00\nCalculate mass = sum(length*area_value), keep max below 30.",

  "calculation": "Using areas from dict, area ID mapping:\n- area 3 =1.759\n- area 2 =0.782\n- area 1 =0.195\n\nMember masses roughly:\n- m1 (node_1-node_5):3.84*1.759=6.75\n- m2 (node_2-node_6):3.44*1.759=6.05\n- m3 (node_3-node_5):3.0*0.782=2.35\n- m4 (node_3-node_6):3.08*0.782=2.41\n- m5 (node_4-node_5):1.09*0.195=0.21\n- m6 (node_4-node_6):1.35*0.195=0.26\n- m7 (node_5-node_6):1.36*0.195=0.27\n- m8 (node_1-node_4):4.76*0.782=3.72\n- m9 (node_2-node_4):4.19*0.782=3.28\n- m10(node_3-node_2):4.0*0.782=3.13\nTotal mass approx 28.13 < 30, meets mass constraint.\nStress likely below ±30 given improved triangulation and load flow reduction compared to iteration 7.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Structure is now well triangulated with balanced member sizes to keep stress under control and mass below required limit. Supports and load constrained fixed. Areas chosen to reduce oversized mass but maintain strength near load and supports.",
