  "preamble": "Current design meets constraints and has low max stress.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 14.05 < 30; total mass 23.69 < 30; all load/support nodes fixed; structure is closed with no duplicates.",
  "analysis": "Stress values well within limits now, total mass also comfortably below max allowed. Next steps for stress reduction will yield diminishing returns.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Small node adjustments tried in past iterations improved stress significantly. Current node 5 placement balances load paths well.",
  "reasoning": "Further optimization may only marginally reduce small stresses at cost of complexity or mass increase. Current member areas and node positioning form an efficient load path within all constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "No constraint violations. Member 3 area '3' = 1.759 optimal for that member loading, minimal max stress 14.05 MPa safety margin is good.",
  "calculation": "Member stresses range roughly Â±14 MPa on mostly moderate cross-sections; total mass 23.69 is well below 30 allowed. Load applied at node 3 fixed properly by stays to node 1,2,4,5. Node relocations could disrupt equilibrium without large gain.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Current design also closes the truss loop including node 5, reinforcing structure. No members overstressed; no mass overrun.",
