    "preamble": "Optimize truss to keep max stress within ±30 and total mass ≤ 30.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given the load at node_3 at -10N at -45°, supports at node_1(pinned) and node_2(roller). Current design is lightweight but fails stress limits on member_1 (-55.35). Areas used are 1,2,3 but member 1 is overloaded. Mass is well below 30, so area increase might be reconsidered or add nodes for better force distribution.",
    "analysis": "Current design with 4 nodes and 5 members shows high compression stress in member_1 (node_1 to node_3) due to direct tensile/compressive forces and load placement. Members 2-5 are under acceptable stresses. Mass is 15.65 far below limit so room exists to strengthen highly stressed members or add bracing. Adding intermediate nodes to split load paths is a strategy to distribute forces better and reduce max stress.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a node above node_3 to share load path from node_1 and node_2 can help. Using smaller member areas strategically to minimize mass. Member 1 is short length so moderate area might suffice if forces balanced. Check triangular formations for bracing around node_3 and node_4 with added node(s).",
    "proposal": "Add one new node_5 at (2.2, 2.0), keeps node_1, node_2, and node_3 fixed. Create members: node_1-node_5, node_2-node_5, node_3-node_5, node_4-node_5 to create a grid to lower member stresses and redistribute loads. Assign areas carefully: small area on short members to minimize mass, larger area on others with higher forces. Remove overly stressed member_1 direct connection, relying on new node_5 to carry load.",
    "reasoning": "Rearranged force flow with a central node above node_3 helps reduce compression on node_1-node_3 member. Triangular bracing between node_1, node_4, and new node_5 increases stiffness and enhances force distribution. Replacing large area member_5 by subdividing into shorter length members lowers stress per member and total mass. Weak or missing diagonal bracing avoided by additional members to node_5.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths:\nnode_1-node_5 = sqrt((2.2-0)^2 + (2-0)^2) = ~3.0\nnode_2-node_5 = sqrt((6-2.2)^2 + (0-2)^2) = sqrt(3.8^2+2^2)=~4.3\nnode_3-node_5 = sqrt((2.2-2)^2+(2-0)^2)= sqrt(0.04+4)= 2.0\nnode_4-node_5 = sqrt((3-2.2)^2 + (3.8-2)^2) = sqrt(0.64+3.24)=2.05\nAssign areas carefully: use '2'=0.782 or '3'=1.759 where stress anticipated higher, smaller '1'=0.195 or '0'=1 for others. Total length * area mass calculation to remain below 30 and check stresses near ±30.",
    "calculation": "Sum member lengths * area: \nnode1-node5 ~3.0, area=2 → 3.0*0.782=2.35\nnode2-node5 ~4.3, area=2 → 4.3*0.782=3.36\nnode3-node5 2.0, area=1 → 2.0*0.195=0.39\nnode4-node5 2.05, area=2 → 2.05*0.782=1.6\nnode1-node4 4.43, area=2 → 4.43*0.782=3.46\nnode3-node2 4.0, area=2 → 4.0*0.782=3.13\nRemove direct node1-node3 to reduce high compressive force on member1\nnode2-node4 4.0, area=2 → 4.0*0.782=3.13\nSum mass approx: 2.35+3.36+0.39+1.6+3.46+3.13+3.13=approx 17.42 < 30\nStress expected lower due to better bracing and load path. Expected max stress under ±30.",
    "scratch_pad_final": "The new node_5 serves as a load transfer hub, redistributing load from node_3. Members redesigned with medium areas on long members for strength but limited mass. Triangular formations ensure stiffness and reduce compression stress spikes. Direct heavily loaded paths removed or reduced in area. This should satisfy stress and mass constraints based on rationalizing member forces and geometry.",
