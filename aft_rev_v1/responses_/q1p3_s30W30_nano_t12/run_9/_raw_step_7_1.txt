Current design is lightweight but fails stress limits on member_1 (-55.35). Areas used are 1,2,3 but member 1 is overloaded. Mass is well below 30, so area increase might be reconsidered or add nodes for better force distribution.",\n    "analysis": "Current design with 4 nodes and 5 members shows high compression stress in member_1 (node_1 to node_3) due to direct tensile/compressive forces and load placement. Members 2-5 are under acceptable stresses. Mass is 15.65 far below limit so room exists to strengthen highly stressed members or add bracing. Adding intermediate nodes to split load paths is a strategy to distribute forces better and reduce max stress.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a node above node_3 to share load path from node_1 and node_2 can help. Using smaller member areas strategically to minimize mass. Member 1 is short length so moderate area might suffice if forces balanced. Check triangular formations for bracing around node_3 and node_4 with added node(s).",\n    "proposal": "Add one new node_5 at (2.2, 2.0), keeps node_1, node_2, and node_3 fixed. Create members: node_1-node_5, node_2-node_5, node_3-node_5, node_4-node_5 to create a grid to lower member stresses and redistribute loads. Assign areas carefully: small area on short members to minimize mass, larger area on others with higher forces. Remove overly stressed member_1 direct connection, relying on new node_5 to carry load.",\n    "reasoning": "Rearranged force flow with a central node above node_3 helps reduce compression on node_1-node_3 member. Triangular bracing between node_1, node_4, and new node_5 increases stiffness and enhances force distribution. Replacing large area member_5 by subdividing into shorter length members lowers stress per member and total mass. Weak or missing diagonal bracing avoided by additional members to node_5.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths:\\nnode_1-node_5 = sqrt((2.2-0)^2 + (2-0)^2) = ~3.0\\nnode_2-node_5 = sqrt((6-2.2)^2 + (0-2)^2) = sqrt(3.8^2+2^2)=~4.3\\nnode_3-node_5 = sqrt((2.2-2)^2+(2-0)^2)= sqrt(0.04+4)= 2.0\\nnode_4-node_5 = sqrt((3-2.2)^2 + (3.8-2)^2) = sqrt(0.64+3.24)=2.05\\nAssign areas carefully: use \'2\'=0.782 or \'3\'=1.759 where stress anticipated higher, smaller \'1\'=0.195 or \'0\'=1 for others.
