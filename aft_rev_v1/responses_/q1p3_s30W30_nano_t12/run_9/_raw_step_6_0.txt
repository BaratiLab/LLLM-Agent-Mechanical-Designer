Current mass 34.6 too high. Stress acceptable max ~9.2. Node_3 load at (-10, -45°). Supports fixed at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Existing structure has excessive mass mainly from heavy member between node_2 and node_5 (area 4: mass 14.98). Multiple top nodes around 3–4 m height add mass. Members on compression or tension within limits but total mass too large. Sections with large area and many intermediate nodes cause excess mass. Need leaner design reducing redundant members and areas. Load transfer via fewer, efficient truss elements. Key nodes: remain nodes 1, 2, 3. Intermediate nodes to be rationalized.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce or remove node_5 and node_7; reposition node_4 and node_6 to optimize load path. Simplify horizontal members at top. Use smaller cross sections for most members; reserve larger areas only where stress demand high. Connect critical path from load (node_3) to supports (1 and 2). Remove members with minimal force or combined load path. Optimal layout likely triangular with strong diagonal bracing.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Utilize nodes: node_1 (support pinned, 0,0), node_2 (roller support, 6,0), node_3 (load, 2.0, 0.0), add node_4 at (3.0, 3.8) forming a top vertex. Connect: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4. Also connect node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2 for lower chord. Assign areas mainly 2 and 3 to reduce mass but ensure stress ≤ ±30. Use the higher area 4 or 5 for only more stressed members after checking forces in recalculation. Delete extraneous nodes 5,6,7 and their members. Structure is simpler triangular truss transmitting load efficiently.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Minimizing intermediate nodes and heavy horizontals reduces mass. Triangular geometry efficiently carries combined load from node_3 through node_4 to supports. Top node position at ~3.8 avoids excessive member length and reduces bending/moment. Areas selected balancing between stress capacity and mass. Connected members each have clear force flow path, minimizing stress concentration and averting over-designing. Keeping top node near vertical of node_3 transfers load mainly axially. Removing multiple irregular nodes avoids complex force patterns and redundant mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Merit in 4 nodes & 6 members. Member lengths around 3–4 m for diagonals, 2–4 m for chords. Assign area 3 (1.759) to diagonals, area 2 (0.782) to chords. Length × area sum expected below 30 mass. Stress limited due to direct axial force transmission. Validate max stress below 30 with these areas conservatively.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Members lengths (approx): node_1-node_4 ~4.7, node_2-node_4 ~3.2, node_3-node_4 ~3.9, node_1-node_3=2.0, node_3-node_2=4.0, node_1-node_2=6.0(not used to reduce mass). Mass = Σ length × area using chosen areas below 30. Estimated total mass: (4.7*3) + (3.2*3) + (3.9*3) + (2*2) + (4*2) ≈ 14.1 + 9.6 + 11.7 + 1.56 + 3.12 = 40.1 too high if all area 3. Reduce member area on chord (node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2) to area 1 (0.195): 2*0.195=0.39, 4*0.195=0.78; sum:14.1+9.6+11.7+0.39+0.78=36.57, still large. Reduce diagonals node_1-node_4 and node_2-node_4 to area 2 (0.782): masses 4.7*0.782=3.68 and 3.2*0.782=2.5, and node_3-node_4 remains 3*3.9=11.7. Sum:3.68+2.5+11.7+0.39+0.78=19.05 well below mass limit. This saves mass, still strong diagonals support load efficiently. Check stress: diagonals carry compression/tension with area 2 or 3; chords with area 1 manageable given known load. Max stress estimated <30.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_final": "Final nodes: no extra nodes beyond needed for truss topology. Members connect must avoid duplication.
