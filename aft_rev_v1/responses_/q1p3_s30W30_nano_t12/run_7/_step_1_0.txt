  "preamble": "Current design satisfies constraints with moderate stress and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Aim to minimize stress below ±30 with mass ≤30, optimizing node_4 as other nodes for load/support fixed.",
  "analysis": "Current max stress is 14.97, well below 30. Total mass is 13.9039, below 30. Stress distribution shows highest compressive stress on member_1 (-14.97) and tensile on member_4 (9.65). No constraint violations.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Small permissible stress margin remains; mass is low, so lightening is unlikely necessary. Node_4 position affects trianguation stiffness and stress distribution, but current location provides a balanced force path from load at node_3 to supports at node_1 and node_2.",
  "reasoning": "Since constraints are well satisfied, and given fixed load/support nodes, minimal changes to node_4 would only slightly affect stress. Member areas at '2' are moderate (area factor 0.782), smaller areas may increase stress; larger areas would increase mass unnecessarily. Current areas balance strength and mass well.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length-member stress interaction optimal for current geometry. Switching nodal placement of node_4 will either increase stresses or mass. No duplication of members. Areas comply with codes, no benefit seen in area changes since some members are already at min viable areas.",
  "calculation": "No changes made as mass is 13.9<30 and max stress is 14.97<30. Stress values are well balanced across members. No adjustments to node_4 provide significant stress reduction given constraints and loading.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Checked fixed load/support nodes; no duplicates; areas consistent; optimized location widely at node_4 = (3, 2.4); max stress far from limits; mass low; no improvement evident.",
