  "preamble": "Optimize a minimal closed truss to minimize stress under load within mass and stress limits.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes node_1(0.0,0.0 pinned), node_2(6.0,0.0 roller), and load on node_3(2.0,0.0) as (-10.0, -45deg). Max stress ±30, max mass ≤30. Area choices from 0..10. Must ensure structure is closed (all nodes connected in loop). Cannot move existing nodes.",
  
  "analysis": "Starting with three nodes placed on x-axis; node_3 loaded diagonally downward-left. Current nodes colinear: open truss. To make the truss closed, add at least one new node above line to form a triangle. Three nodes minimum for closed truss. New nodes must be precisely placed to minimize member length and keep stress + mass low. Connect all nodes with minimal members:",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 above x-axis near node_3 to form triangular shape: maybe (2.0, y), with y>0. Triangle members: connect node_1-4, node_2-4, node_3-4 added. Triangular frame distributes forces to supports. Loads cause compression/tension in members; areas adjusted based on calculated internal forces.",
  
  "reasoning": "Because node_3 is loaded diagonally down-left, node_4 above node_3 facet counteracts vertical and horizontal components. Absorbing load in compression and tension within ±30 stress means cross sections can be chosen to optimize stress-force ratio. Calculate forces roughly via method of joints or sections. Use areas to keep stress bounded. Mass=sum(length*area). Member length minimized to control mass. Use minimal cross sections for compression members w/ low force, larger for tension with higher force to meet stress limit. Keeps overall mass ≤30.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assume unit force on member stress σ = F/A. Stress ≤ 30, thus A ≥ |F|/30. Calculate member forces from given load -10N at 45°. Decompose load to Fx = -7.07N, Fy = -7.07N. Sum forces react at supported nodes. Use static equilibrium to find internal forces. Calculate lengths with Euclidean distance, ... Then calculate mass and check total ≤ 30. members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_3 to create redundant/trinagulated structure preventing instability.",
