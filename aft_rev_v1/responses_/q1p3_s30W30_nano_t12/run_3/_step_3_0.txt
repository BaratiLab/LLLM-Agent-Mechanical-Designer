  "preamble": "Current structure satisfies constraints with max stress 25.74 and mass ~19.5.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress constraint ±30 met, total mass below 30. Stress significantly reduced from prior steps.",
  
  "analysis": "Maximum stress in structure is 25.74 < 30 allowable. Total mass is 19.53 < 30 max. Stress distribution shows no member critically overstressed. Member areas range from 1 (0.195 area) to 4 (3.128 area) providing appropriate sectional areas for load. Nodal layout maintains load/support constraints. Optimization primarily reduced stress massively over iterations.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further stress reductions would be marginal, as no stress approaches limit. Mass margin also exists, but optimization focus is stress; size reduction would increase stress potentially beyond allowable.",
  
  "reasoning": "Current design strategically placed new node ('new_node') and moved intermediate node 'node_5' lower to balance forces and spread stress. Members with highest stress have adequate areas. Further nodal movement risks load/support violation or member redundancy loss. Additional complex topology changes not permitted; increments show diminishing returns. Given constraints fulfilled and design size, stopped further modification.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member stresses all under ±30 with max ~25.7 in tension/compression. Mass detailed by member length x assigned areas is 19.53 < 30 limit. No duplicate nodes or members. Assigned cross sections consistent with member forces. Load at 'node_3' fixed and supports at 'node_1', 'node_2', not modified. Positions precise float values.",
  
  "calculation": "Checked member force distribution, noted max absolute stress < 30. Calculated total mass from lengths and section areas as 19.53, well within 30 limit. Node coordinates unmodified from current satisfactory iteration except allowed 'node_5' moved in prior step. Members connections consistent and closed topology.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "No additional nodal shift can decrease maximum stress without tradeoff increasing other members stress beyond limit. Safe margins present but extensive improvement requiring topology change out of problem constraints. Hence optimization stopped.",
