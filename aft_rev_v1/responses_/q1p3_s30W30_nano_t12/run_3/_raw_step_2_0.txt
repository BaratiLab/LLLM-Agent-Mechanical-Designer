Constraints max stress ±30, max mass <= 30. Current max stress 62.63 exceeds limit. Mass 20.4 is okay.",\n  "analysis": "Current design stressed member_6 at 62.6 crossing ±30 limit. Member_5 also at 45.1 stress high. Load induces high tension/compression in longer diagonals. Members with lowest assigned area fail to reduce stress below 30. Areas used vary but low in critical members impractical given high forces. Structural layout lacks sufficient bracing for load direction. Current nodes mainly colinear in bottom; extra node inside (node_5) not sufficient to share load properly. High max area in member_4 raises mass significantly with little stress reduction. Need to both revise member layout and choose more uniform, stress-focused area distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Better approach: add vertical and diagonal bracing near load node_3. This distributes forces into supporting pinned and roller more effectively. Also shorter members reduce stress. Keep load/support nodes fixed.Lock designs to low mass topology: possibly include node inserted up the line from node_3 toward node_4 but shifted laterally synthesis more triangular geometries. Choose area sizes that reflect member stress but keep mass under 30.",\n  "proposal": "Add one node above node_3 displaced slightly right and up, forming a strong triangular brace with node_4 and node_3 improving load paths. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-new_node, new_node-node_4, new_node-node_5 (adjusted) node_5 connects to node_2 (roller). Also include a member node_1-node_4 for support stiffening. Assign areas balanced between 3,2,1 IDs to keep mass low but stress with limits.",\n  "reasoning": "Triangular patterns with moderate member length improve force distribution and reduce max stress. Load at node_3 downward diagonally transmitted via new_node to node_4 and node_1 decreases tension/compression peaks. Assign intermediate cross sections to accommodate stresses. Avoid very large or small area extremes that increase mass or fail stress. Minimizing wide disparity in members\' cross section avoids stress concentration and mass penalty. Adjusted node location leverages better force path, avoids overloading one or two members, respecting symmetry and constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Based on geometry, length of members 1-3 shorter than original node_3-node_4 diagonal, areas chosen from {\'0\':1,\'1\':0.195,\'2\':0.782,\'3\':1.759}. Assumptions member lengths approx 2–3 units, areas ~1 to 2 for key braces. Mass approx sum(length*area) not exceed 30. Area chosen to fit stress limits ±30 using rough optimization.
