Stress significantly reduced from prior steps.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Maximum stress in structure is 25.74 < 30 allowable. Total mass is 19.53 < 30 max. Stress distribution shows no member critically overstressed. Member areas range from 1 (0.195 area) to 4 (3.128 area) providing appropriate sectional areas for load. Nodal layout maintains load/support constraints. Optimization primarily reduced stress massively over iterations.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further stress reductions would be marginal, as no stress approaches limit. Mass margin also exists, but optimization focus is stress; size reduction would increase stress potentially beyond allowable.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Current design strategically placed new node (\'new_node\') and moved intermediate node \'node_5\' lower to balance forces and spread stress. Members with highest stress have adequate areas. Further nodal movement risks load/support violation or member redundancy loss. Additional complex topology changes not permitted; increments show diminishing returns. Given constraints fulfilled and design size, stopped further modification.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member stresses all under ±30 with max ~25.7 in tension/compression. Mass detailed by member length x assigned areas is 19.53 < 30 limit. No duplicate nodes or members. Assigned cross sections consistent with member forces. Load at \'node_3\' fixed and supports at \'node_1\', \'node_2\', not modified. Positions precise float values.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Checked member force distribution, noted max absolute stress < 30. Calculated total mass from lengths and section areas as 19.53, well within 30 limit. Node coordinates unmodified from current satisfactory iteration except allowed \'node_5\' moved in prior step. Members connections consistent and closed topology.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "No additional nodal shift can decrease maximum stress without tradeoff increasing other members stress beyond limit.
