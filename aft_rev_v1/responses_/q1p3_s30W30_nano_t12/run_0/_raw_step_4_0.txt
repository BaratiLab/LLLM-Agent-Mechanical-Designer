Supports and load fixed. Nodes for load/support unchanged.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress well reduced compared to previous steps, and all members remain within allowable stress and mass limits. Current geometry with node_4 at (2.85,4.0) and node_5 at (4.2,2.8) stabilizes load paths and reduces critical member stresses.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further moves of node_4 or node_5 may not produce signficant stress reduction given diminishing returns and maintaining closed truss topology.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Since max stress is 13.6 (45% utilization of allowable max), redesign efforts should be minimal unless mass reduction is required. Large mass savings are unlikely without pushing stresses upward. Cross-section areas selected conform to area mapping, and likely optimized given constraints. Continuing iteration risks disrupting balanced stress distribution or increasing mass. Given constrained movable nodes and support/load fixity, the configuration is near optimal.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Review member stresses: members with highest absolute stresses are member_1(-13.3) and member_5(13.6), opposite signs balancing load transfer. Middle members have lower stresses. Mass margins are good, so no need for larger cross-section increasing mass.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Using node positions as given, to shift node_4 too high would increase member lengths and might increase mass without significant stress benefit. Lowering node_4 reduces height and increases compression in lower chord potentially. Node_5 position (4.2,2.8) balances geometry to optimize force flow.

Total mass at 21.826 well below max 30, max stress at 13.6 below limit ±30.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "No violations found; structure closed; load, supports unchanged; member sizes all valid from definition.
