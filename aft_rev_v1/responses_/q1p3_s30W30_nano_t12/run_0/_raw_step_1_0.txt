Max tensile stress overshoot in member_2 (node_1-node_3) at -33.7. Mass is borderline but acceptable. Current topology has excessive stress in bottom chords. Structure resembles trapezoid with a diagonal node_3 on bottom chord over full-span between pinned and roller supports.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing cross section (area_id) on high tensile members lowers stress but may breach deflection/stress. Optimizing geometry: increase height and add one node for better triangulation and stress redistribution. Remove diagonal member_6 overloading via reconfiguration. Keep node_3 fixed as load application, shift node_4 for wider height, add node_5 for stable triangular pattern.",\n  "proposal": "Propose a 5-node truss: nodes at supports node_1@ (0,0), node_2@ (6,0), load node_3@ (2,0) fixed. Add node_4 at (3.0, 5.0) above to increase height. Add node_5 at (4.5,3.0) as intermediate joint. Member connectivity: \'member_1\': (\'node_1\', \'node_3\', \'2\'), \'member_2\': (\'node_3\', \'node_4\', \'3\'), \'member_3\': (\'node_3\', \'node_5\', \'1\'), \'member_4\': (\'node_2\', \'node_5\', \'2\'), \'member_5\': (\'node_4\', \'node_5\', \'1\'), \'member_6\': (\'node_1\', \'node_4\', \'1\'), \'member_7\': (\'node_2\', \'node_3\', \'1\')",\n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 redistributes load paths, increasing height reduces member forces under diagonal loading, potential for lower cross-section areas assigned by increasing areas in tension members and reducing others accordingly. Using mostly smaller cross-section areas for less stressed members (area_id 1-2) and moderate area_id (2-3) for critical tension members for balance between mass and stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node positions derived to keep supports and load fixed; support at (0,0), (6,0), load at (2,0). Height raised from 4.24 to 5.0; intermediate node placed strategically to reconnect members into triangles. Area selection accounts for stress under tension-compression max 30 limit.",\n  "calculation": "Estimating member lengths and areas: member_1 ~2m length × 0.782, member_2 ~3.16m × 1.759, member_3 ~1.802m × 0.195, member_4 ~1.80m × 0.782, member_5 ~1.80m × 0.195, member_6 ~5.39m × 0.195, member_7 ~4.00m × 0.195.
