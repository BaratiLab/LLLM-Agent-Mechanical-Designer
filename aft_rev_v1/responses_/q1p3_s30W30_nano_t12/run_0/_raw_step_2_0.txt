Load and supports fixed at node_1(0,0) and node_2(6,0).",\n\n  "analysis": "Max stress at member_6 (node_1-node_4) near 28.19 close to limit ±30. Member_5 also with moderate stress 12.72. Nodes involving high stress: node_4 at (3.0,5.0) and node_5 at (4.5,3.0). Diagonal members carry different force signs identified. Mass 16.32 well below max 30, room to redistribute forces or alter geometry to reduce max stress.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider shifting node_4 downwards and closer to node_5 and node_3 to reduce tension in member_6 and stress buildup. Node_3 fixed x=2.0, y=0 due to load presence, node_1 and node_2 fixed supports. Lowering node_4 from y=5 to say y=4 or 4.25 might reduce elongation forces, possibly also shift node_5 slightly towards node_4 horizontally to reduce high tension along member_5 and member_6.",\n\n  "reasoning": "By moving node_4 closer vertically to node_3 and node_5, stress in the highest stressed members can be reduced. Retain the closed truss connectivity, keep existing members intact to avoid drastic topology changes. Areas also can be reassigned if needed but here kept minimal area change given mass reserve. Lowering the height of node_4 should reduce stress at member_6 bearing compression near limit and balancing compression/tension in surrounding members, combined with horizontal move of node_5 slightly left to redistribute forces.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Proposed new node_4: x=3.0 (fixed), y=4.2; Node_5 move left from 4.5 to 4.3, same y=3.0. Assume rebalanced stress with decreases in maximum stress by ~10%, validate no member exceeds ±30 with recycled mass within 16-17. Areas maintained as in iteration_1 to avoid mass increase.",\n\n  "calculation": "With node_4 at (3.0, 4.2), member lengths reduce for member_6, reducing stress. Node_5 at (4.3, 3.0) reduces member_5 tension. Calculate member lengths approximately: member_6 (node_1-node_4) length = sqrt(3.0^2 + 4.2^2)=5.16 vs 5.83 before; stress ~ force/area·length and member areas constant so stress reduces proportional to length reduction.
