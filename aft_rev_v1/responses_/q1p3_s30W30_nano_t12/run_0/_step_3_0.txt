  "preamble": "Optimize truss to reduce max stress while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 29.71 is close but below 30 limit; mass 14.72 well below 30 limit. Nodes load/support fixed: node_1, node_2, node_3 must stay. Nodes 4 and 5 positions modifiable for stress reduction. Member areas chosen from given set with target to minimize max stress.",

  "analysis": "Members 6 and 1 have highest absolute compressive stress (near 29.7). Both connected to node_4; node_4 moved from (3.0,5.0) -> (3.0,4.2) reduced mass and stress but stress still close to limit. Node_5 moved closer to node_2 (4.5->4.3), member stresses improved compared to iteration_1. Further optimization should reposition nodes 4 and 5 and adjust member areas especially for members 1 and 6 to reduce high compressive stresses.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Current node_4 at (3.0,4.2) likely still causing high stress in adjacent members. Slight lowering or horizontal moving node_4 to reduce compressive forcing on member_6 advisable. Increasing cross-sectional area on member_6 could reduce stress, at slight mass cost. Member 6 currently area 1 (0.195), maybe increase to 2 (0.782) or 3 (1.759) to reduce high stress. Member 1 also has high compressive stress (-13.3) with area 2 (0.782). Possibly redistribute area between these members to balance stress and mass.",

  "reasoning": "Keep loads and supports fixed at nodes 1,2,3. Move nodes 4 and 5 to better positions to reduce local stress peaks. Slight horizontal move of node_4 closer to node_1 reduces member_6 compressive demand. Similarly, node_5 closer to reduce moment demands on member_5 and 4. Increase area selection for member_6 from 1 to 3 to reduce max stress safely. Member_1 area can remain at 2 due to lower stress compliance. These adjustments should reduce max stress while keeping total mass under limit.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Member areas: member_1 area_2=0.782, member_6 area_3=1.759. Node_4 move from (3.0,4.2) to ~ (2.85,4.0). Node_5 move from (4.3,3.0) to ~ (4.2,2.8). These incremental movements reduce member length and bending stresses slightly, lowering max stress in members 1 and 6. Calculate updated member lengths and stresses based on new geometry; verify constraints.",

  "calculation": "Estimated new member_6 length decreased slightly, increasing compressive capacity with larger area reduces stress ~ 25-27 from 29.7. Member_1 compression less impacted but area maintained at 0.782. Total mass increased slightly but remains under 15. Mass sum approx 14.7 -> 15.6 tentative. Max stress expected <30, safer margin achieved.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicated nodes/members, load/support nodes fixed, areas updated only for areas 1->3 for member_6, others maintained. Position precision preserved to four decimals precision to keep numerical accuracy for FEM. Confirm closed 2D truss is same member set, suitable for constraints and loads.",
