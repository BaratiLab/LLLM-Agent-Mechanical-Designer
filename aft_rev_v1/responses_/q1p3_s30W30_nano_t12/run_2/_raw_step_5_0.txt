Total mass 21.19 < 30 limit. Members with area id \'2\' mostly carry stresses ~±9. The critical compressive stress mostly on member_1 (-9.175). The top node_4 adjusted previously from 3.65 to 3.4 height lowered stresses compared to iteration_3. Further slight vertical and lateral adjustments to node_4 could reduce loads in members and better align forces, reducing stress.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 and member_2 are compression and tension arms of the triangle. member_4 carries intermediate load (area 3) with low stress ~2.054. Areas can be maintained as current for stable stress distribution, we focus on geometry optimization.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "By slightly moving node_4 closer to node_3 horizontally (reduce x slightly below 2.05) and slightly upwards (around 3.45), we can better triangulate forces between nodes to reduce member_1 compressive stress (currently max compression). Keeping node_4 x > node_3 x but under current 2.05 might reduce compression in member_1 by realigning geometry. Incrementally optimizing for stress first before lowering areas will better guide next iteration.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Plan: move node_4 from (2.05,3.4) toward (2.02, 3.45). Recalculate member lengths: member_1 (node_1-node_3) fixed; member_2 length increases very slightly; member_3 length (node_4-node1) similar; member_4 length steady.
