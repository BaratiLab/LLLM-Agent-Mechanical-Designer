Load of 10 units at node_3 in -45° direction. Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Constraints: stress ≤ ±30, mass ≤ 30. We must keep nodes fixed but can add new nodes and members for closure and optimization.",\n    \n  "analysis": "The initial 3 nodes lie on x-axis, making direct member connections less effective for vertical and diagonal load paths. To minimize stress, create a triangular truss by adding nodes above or below existing nodes to distribute load. Support reactions at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) allow moment equilibrium. Strategy: add one or two nodes above the line to form closed polygon structure distributing axial forces optimally. Keep members short to minimize mass. Select members with adequate area to maintain stress ≤ 30 under load.",\n    \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 3.5) above node_3 to help transfer load vertically and diagonally towards supports. Closing members: connect node_4 to nodes 1 and 2 forming a triangle 1-4-2 and connecting node_3 to node_4 ensuring load path. Total members: 1-3, 3-4, 4-2, 4-1, 1-2. Calculate stress and mass approximately with chosen areas and member lengths.",\n    \n  "reasoning": "Assuming pinned supports at node_1 and roller at node_2 fix vertical displacements, node_4 placed above node_3 creates triangles assisting in force distribution. Triangles minimize bending moments transforming them to axial forces (good for member stress control). Use simple truss analysis: member stress = axial force / area. Axial force approximated from load distribution and length ratios. Areas chosen from given discrete values to limit mass and stress. Equilibrium in vertical and horizontal directions splits the applied load largely to members connected to node_4. Lengths matter for mass: choose shortest feasible lengths that maintain effective triangle geometry.",\n    \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Members defined: 1-3, 3-4, 4-1, 4-2, 2-1.
