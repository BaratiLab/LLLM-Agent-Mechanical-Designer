  "preamble": "Optimize the current 2D truss design to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max stress ≤ ±30, total mass ≤ 30. Current max stress: 18.36 within limits, mass: 13.18 well below max. Load applied at node_3 (-10, -45°). Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Nodes with loads/supports fixed in position.",

  "analysis": "Member_4 connecting node_4 to node_2 has highest tensile stress (~18.36). Other members are well below limit. Total mass is also low compared to max limit. Current geometry: node_3 low at (2,0); node_4 high at (2,3.5). Members 1-3 form a triangle at left side.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress extreme at member_4 likely due to load placement and truss geometry. Increasing stiffness or load path directivity to reduce stress required. Possible raise node_4 vertical position slightly for stability, or adjust node_3 along x-direction to optimize force flow.",

  "reasoning": "Cannot move fixed nodes node_1, node_2, and node_3. Node_3 is load applied point. Architecture encourages force to be transferred from load node_3 via nodes 4 and 1 to supports. Member area for member_4 is minimal (area_id='1' =0.195), smallest; increasing area here can reduce stress. To save mass, consider reducing area for other less stressed members. Optionally, adjust node_4 up slightly (e.g., y ~4.0) to improve force direction and reduce tensile stress in member_4.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member areas: current member_4 area=1 (0.195), small. Max stress member_4=18.36. Other members area=2 (0.782) except member_5=2 (0.782). Increase member_4 area to 4 (3.128) or 5 (4.887) to reduce stress. Mass increase approx member length × Δarea density. Node_4 from 3.5 to ~4.0 increases member_2 and 3 lengths marginally but could improve internal force distribution.",

  "calculation": "Move node_4 from (2.0,3.5) to (2.0,4.0). Increase member_4 area from '1'(0.195) to '4'(3.128). Reduce member_5 area from '2'(0.782) to '0'(1) initially was 0.782? '0' =1 is larger, reduce to '1' (0.195) to save mass, given low stress on member_5. Check total mass estimate:\nMember lengths:\n- member_1 ~2.0 (node_1 to node_3 horizontal 2m)\n- member_2 increased from ~3.5 to ~4.0\n- member_3 increased a bit\n- member_4 length about sqrt((6-2)^2+(0-4)^2)=sqrt(16+16)=5.656\n- member_5 length 6.0\nEstimate masses:\nmember_4: 5.656*3.128=17.69 up from 1.0364\nmember_5: 6.0*0.195=1.17 down from 4.692\nOthers approx same\nTotal mass recalculation upper bound ~ (1.56*0.782/0.782)+ (4.0*0.782) + other members + sum... mass still likely below 30. Total reducing member_5 area and increasing member_4 area is most effective.\nStress should reduce due to increased area on tensile member.\nStop not justified as stress reduced but member_4 biggest stress may still be close to constraints; allow next iteration.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Maintain nodes fixed: node_1, node_2, node_3. Move node_4 upward to 4.0. Increase member_4 area to '4'. Reduce member_5 area to smallest or close. Other members keep area '2'. Check no duplication of members, all members included. Expect reduced max stress and mass still under constraints.",
