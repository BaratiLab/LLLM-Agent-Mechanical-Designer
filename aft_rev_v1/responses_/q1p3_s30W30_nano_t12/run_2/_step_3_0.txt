  "preamble": "Optimize nodal position of node_4 to reduce stress while mass within limit.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current truss satisfies constraints with max stress 14.5<30, total mass 18.17<30. Load at node_3, supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2, fixed. Node_4 can be repositioned only. Area sizes mostly fixed at '2', '3', '1'.",

  "analysis": "Member stresses balanced, member_5 most critical compressive (-14.5), members around node_4 have moderate stresses. Node_4 is moved 1.8,3.5 vs previous iteration 2,4. Lowering node_4 reduced max stress from 18.36 to 14.5. Further repositioning node_4 slightly lower and right may redistribute stresses decreasing max further. Mass is moderate (18.17), room to increase section in high-stress members if needed. Currently members 1,2,3 have area '2' (0.782), member_4 area '3' (1.759), member_5 area '1' (0.195). Minor increase of areas possible if beneficial. Critical stress is member 5 around -14.5. Need to reduce stress magnitude there.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Explore shifting node_4 closer horizontally toward node_3 to better balance axial forces along members connected to node_4 and 3, reducing compression in member_5 and tension in others. Small vertical moves may help. Minimal area increment in member_5 from '1' (0.195) to '2' (0.782) may reduce stress. Verify mass with these changes.",

  "reasoning": "Reducing eccentricity of node_4 in horizontal direction distributes forces away from member_5, reduce extreme compressive stress. Increase member_5 area to '2' (0.782) to reduce stress. Members connected to node_4 with area '2' can be kept or raised to '3' if mass allows. Sum mass after changes still under 30. Keep supports fixed, loads undisturbed. Use precise float coordinate modifications to node_4 only.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Current lengths approximate and impacts stresses. Member lengths roughly: m1 (node_1-node_3): 2.0, m2 (node_3-node_4): ~3.22 with new coord, m3 (node_4-node_1): ~3.80 with new coord, m4 (node_4-node_2): ~4.3, m5(node_1-node_2): 6.0. Increasing area from '1'->'2' increases mass but reduces stress substantially. Weights mass formula verified. Final total mass under 30.",

  "calculation": "Propose node_4 reposition to (1.95,3.65), closer horizontally to node_3 at 2.0 and slightly higher than current 3.5 to distribute axial forces better.\nUpdate member_5 area from '1' to '2'.\nMembers 1,2,3 maintain area '2', member_4 area '3'.\nEstimate mass increase is ~+1.2 from previous step for member_5.\nExpected max stress reduction from stress redistribution and area increase in member_5 expected. Total mass above 19 but below 30, max stress below 14.5 due to improved geometry or equal.\nNo duplicate nodes/clashes, closed 2D truss retained.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no violation of stress +/-30, mass <=30. Node_4 moved precisely as allowed. Load and support nodes unchanged. No duplicate nodes/members. Areas chosen from allowed list. Expected reduction in max stress given better equilibrium. Decide continue optimization next iterations.",
