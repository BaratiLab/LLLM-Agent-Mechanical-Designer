Current design exceeds stress constraint on member_2 (-36.26 vs -30 allowed). Mass below max. Need to reduce stress mainly in member_2 and member_3.",\n  "analysis": "Member_2 connecting node_3 to elevated node_4 (2.0, 2.2) is overstressed in compression (-36.26). Member_3 (node_4 to node_2) is highly stressed (25.08 tensile). Current design shape elongates load path causing high stress in short vertical members. Member areas vary but member_2 area=1 chosen is small, causing stress spike. Mass is reasonable so room exists to increase area or add members. Single added node above node_3 at (2.0,2.2) not optimal. The load direction (-10 at -45°) asks to balance diagonal load transfer with compression and tension members matching the force vector.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Incrementally increasing node_4 y-height is inefficient. Reconsider node layout: add one additional node between node_3 and node_4 higher, and possibly another to redistribute forces. Create triangulated members between support nodes and load node to improve force paths and reduce stress. Use areas available strategically.",\n  "proposal": "Add a new node (node_5) precisely placed above node_3 at (2.0, 3.0) to create a stiffer triangular system. Redefine members as follows: member_1 (node_1-node_3, area 3), member_2 (node_3-node_5, area 4), member_3 (node_5-node_4, area 2), member_4 (node_4-node_2, area 2), member_5 (node_1-node_4, area 3), member_6 (node_5-node_2, area 2), member_7 (node_2-node_3, area 3). This triangulation improves load sharing, reduces max stress, and keeps mass in limits.",\n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 at a higher elevation above node_3 increases leverage and changes force distribution, reducing compression on member_2 and tensile stress on member_3. Adjusting member areas prioritizes higher areas on high force members to control stress within ±30. Using multiple triangulated members creates redundant load paths that uniformly distribute stresses and reduce peak values. Areas are kept under practical ranges (max area 4.887) to control mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths calculated by Euclidean distance. Use length × area to estimate mass per member. Check sum of masses <= 30 from area lookup table. Stress estimated from prior stress ratios adjusted by area increase and load path change.",\n  "calculation": "Member lengths approx: node_1-node_3 ~2m, node_3-node_5 ~1m up, node_5-node_4 ~1.0m down to (2.0,2.2), node_4-node_2 ~4.0m diagonal, node_1-node_4 ~2.6m diagonal, node_5-node_2 ~4.47m diagonal, node_2-node_3 ~4.0m diagonal. Assigning suitable area IDs from {0:1,...,10:19.548} to keep mass sum approx: member_1 (area 3=1.759), member_2 (area 4=3.128), member_3 (area 2=0.782), member_4 (area 2=0.782), member_5 (area 3=1.759), member_6 (area 2=0.782), member_7 (area 3=1.759).
