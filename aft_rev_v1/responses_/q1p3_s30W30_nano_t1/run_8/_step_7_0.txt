  "preamble": "Optimized a 6-node truss with top chord nodes and a central node for internal load support.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Existing structure satisfies constraints with max stress 14.07 < 30 and mass 23.57 < 30; loads applied at node_3; supports at node_1 and node_2; only movable nodes are node_4, node_5, node_6.",
  "analysis": "Current addition of node_6 as internal node creating two diagonal members reduces max stress significantly versus previous iterations. Member areas are chosen moderately. Node positions balance load distribution without violating constraints, reducing peak stresses below 15. Current max stress is well inside limits and total mass is under max allowed.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further improvements may reduce stress, but likely minimal due to already low max stress and moderate mass. Node_4 and node_5 at Y=2.4 create effective top chord; node_6 at center (3,1.2) adds needed stiffness. Member areas selected to balance mass and strength.",
  "reasoning": "The addition of internal node_6 splits forces in top chord, decreasing member stresses. Maintaining node_1 and node_2 on ground fixed points is necessary. Moving top chord nodes up or down may affect stress and mass, but risking going near max mass. Member area '2' (0.782) on critical diagonal members balances tensile and compressive demands. Increasing member area risks exceeding mass; decreasing risks stress violations. Current design strikes optimal balance.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress max ~14; mass ~23.57 < 30; largest compressive member_1 at -14.07 within limits; tensile members limited; member areas mostly '2' to '4'; nodal coordinates comply with load/support constraints; no duplicates; closed truss formed by members.",
  "calculation": "Calculated member lengths from nodes positions and verified areas produce mass 23.57 < 30. Max stress 14.07 < 30 allowable. Diagonal members at node_6 evenly carry internal forces. No violation of constraints. Stress distribution nearly uniform, no excessive peak. Mass efficient with mostly area_id=2 or 4. Optimization achieved.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verified constraints, smooth stress distribution, minimal mass. No overlapping nodes or members. Load/displacement constraints respected. No contradictory design elements. Current design optimal within given limits and instructions.",
