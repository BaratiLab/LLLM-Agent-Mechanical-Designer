  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to meet stress ±30 and mass ≤30 constraints.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress slightly exceeds limit at 31.47 with total mass 29.06 (close to 30). Load at node_3 is -10N inclined -45°. Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Existing nodes mostly on base line and two nodes elevated at y=2.4. Members with oversized areas cause high stress. Need to reduce max stress below 30 by adjusting member areas, topology or node layout, keeping node_1,2,3 fixed.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress(31.47) exceeds by ~5% compression in member_7 between node_3 and node_5. Member_2 and member_5 have large areas (4 and 4) causing heavy mass. Member_7 area is 1 (lowest). Areas on some members unjustified given stresses. Structure has long horizontal members plus diagonals from base to elevated nodes. Load direction at node_3 is diagonally downward left, causing high compression in member_7 diagonally upward to node_5. Total mass of 29.06 is close to limit; any increase may violate mass constraint. Current layout is reasonable in nodal placements but member sizing is suboptimal.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Strategies for improvement: (1) Reduce member_7 stress by shifting node_5 position or adding intermediate node to more evenly distribute forces. (2) Decrease areas on low stress members (member_5 area=4 with stress only 1.96) to save mass. (3) Increase areas of tension/compression critical members but within area limits balancing mass. (4) Possibly add node to split long members and reduce member forces. (5) Use finer area selections from area set to better tailor sizing.",
  
  "proposal": "Remove member_7 (node_3-node_5), add new node_6 at intermediate position between node_3 and node_5 (elevated at y=1.2), connect node_3 to node_6 and node_6 to node_5 with optimized members to reduce force in longest diagonal. Reduce area of member_5 (node_1-node_4) to 2 from 4. Tighten member areas on other low-stress members. Adjust member connections to maintain rigidity and satisfy constraints.",
  
  "reasoning": "Current member_7 carries highest compressive stress exceeding limits. Removing long diagonal and splitting into two shorter diagonals reduces force concentration and stress. Position new node_6 midway at y=1.2 reduces length, thereby stress and allows smaller cross-sections. Reducing area on lightly loaded member_5 reduces total mass. Member areas must be carefully set from allowed discrete areas to keep max stress below 30 and total mass ≤ 30. Connectivities maintain triangulated stable truss.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate new member lengths: node_3(2.0,0.0) to node_6(3.0,1.2): length = sqrt(1^2 + 1.2^2) = 1.56m approx. node_6(3.0,1.2) to node_5(4.0,2.4): same length (~1.56m). These replace node_3-node_5 (~2.69m). Expect lower forces and stress in split members. Adjust areas accordingly: member_7 replaced by member_7a and member_8, areas 1 or 2. Reduce member_5 from area 4 (3.128 mass multiplier) to 2 (0.782) saves ~2.3 mass. Other members keep area 2 or lower as justified by stress margin. Recalculate total mass and verify max stress.",
  
  "calculation": "Replace member_7(node_3-node_5) area 1 with two members: member_7a(node_3-node_6) area 2, member_8(node_6-node_5) area 2. Area 2 weight per length = 0.782. Length 1.56x2=3.12m x 0.782=2.44 mass approx vs old member_7 length 2.69x1=0.609 mass. Slight mass increase but expected stress reduction (overall beneficial). Reduce member_5 area: from 4 (3.128 mass multiplier) length approx 3.125m at area 4 = 12.5 mass approx. Reducing to area 2 (0.782) reduces mass to ~3.125*0.782=2.44 mass, huge savings (~10 mass reduction). Approximately remaining mass calculated adding all members with updated areas, targeting ≤ 30 total. Max stress estimations from splitting and reduced area expected under 30.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "With added intermediate node, better force distribution, and reduced member areas, expect max stress <=30 and total mass just below 30. Maintain node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0). Added node_6 at (3.0,1.2) between node_3 and node_5(4.0,2.4). Adjust member connections to maintain triangulation. Validate no duplicate nodes or members. Areas selected from {0..10}. Confirm constraints before finalizing.",
