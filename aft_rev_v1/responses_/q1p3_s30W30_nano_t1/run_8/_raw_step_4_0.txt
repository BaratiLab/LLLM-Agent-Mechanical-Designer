Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Nodes mostly aligned vertically at x=2 and horizontally at base between 0 to 6m. Previous designs show stresses below max but mass exceeded max 30 limit (currently 33.27). Need to reduce mass by lowering areas and removing/rearranging members, preserving stability and load path.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current iteration 3 has max stress well below ±30, but total mass 33.27 > 30. Members such as member_2 (area 4), and member_1,5,7 with area=3 are heavy. Loads forced through node_3 (mid-span base) with diagonal force, so structure must efficiently transfer load to supports. Introducing truss with fewer large-area members and efficient triangular geometry preferred. Node_5 at (2,3) adds small benefit but increases mass. Load bearing path should be from node_3 to node_1 and node_2 through minimal members with smaller areas. Possible to reduce members or reduce member areas without exceeding allowable stress.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_5 to simplify geometry. Use node_4 at optimized height ~2.0-2.2. Use members node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_3. Choose smaller areas (1 or 2) on longer members to reduce mass. Check lengths: node_1-node_3 length=2m, node_3-node_4 length ~2.2m, node_4-node_2 length ~4m, node_1-node_4 ~2.2m, node_2-node_3 ~4.47m. Minimize large areas on longer members, assign area=2 to critical members, area=1 for others. Check estimated mass to fit under 30. Confirm max stress under 30.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_5.

Optimized position of node_4 at 2.1m vertical sufficient to form stable triangles. Areas selected to maintain strength with minimal material: area 2 and 1 balancing stress and weight. The load at node_3 is shared via node_1 and node_4 to node_2 support. The symmetrical and triangulated form reduces bending. Member length analysis confirms total mass < 30.
