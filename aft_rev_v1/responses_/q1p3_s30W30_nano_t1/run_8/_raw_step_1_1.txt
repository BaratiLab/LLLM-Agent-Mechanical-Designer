Current max stress exceeds 30 limit; total mass under 30 limit. Nodes fixed at support and load points, internal node placement adjustable.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current max stress 36.26 in member_6 (node_3-node_4). Member_4 (node_1-node_4) also stressed high 29.05 close to limit. Mass 8.12 < 30 limit. Areas vary widely; member_6 with small area \'1\' but highest stress suggests need to adjust topology or increase area there. With only one internal free node (node_4), geometry limits force redistribution. Increasing area of member_6 may reduce stress but may increase mass. Adding one more internal node to better redistribute forces is favorable.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding node_5 above node_4 to create two triangles sharing load, enabling force paths that reduce max member stresses. Also choose cross members with suitable areas considering forces and minimize over-sizing to control mass. Avoid horizontal members with minimal load impact. Optimize member areas based on member force directions: higher area for tension/compression near load.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add new node_5 at (4.0, 3.5) above node_4 to form better load path. Keep load/support nodes fixed. Connect members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_3-node_5, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3. Use area selections to control stresses under threshold 30. Remove or resize overstressed members accordingly.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 introduces an extra triangular load path; reduces stress in member_6 (node_3-node_4). Members lengths recalculated for mass estimation. Use mid-range areas where forces are moderate, higher areas only if necessary. Optimize geometry so load distributes among multiple members, abating single member overload. This also maintains lightweight structure below mass limit 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas computed: Example length node_1-node_4 ~3.0, node_4-node_5 ~2.06, node_5-node_2 ~3.0, node_3-node_4 ~3.0, node_3-node_5 ~3.61, node_1-node_3 ~2.0, node_2-node_3 ~4.0. Areas selected from given discrete set to keep stress <=30. Rough mass check: sum(length * area_id factor) < 30. Remove original member_5 between node_2-node_4, replaced by node_5-node_2 and node_4-node_5 for improved force path.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Lengths: node_1-node_4 = 3.0, node_4-node_5 = sqrt((4-2)^2 + (3.5-3)^2) = 2.06, node_5-node_2 = sqrt((6-4)^2 + (0-3.5)^2) = 3.61 approx, node_3-node_4 = 3.0, node_3-node_5 = sqrt((4-2)^2 + (3.5-0)^2) = 3.81, node_1-node_3=2.0, node_2-node_3=4.0.
