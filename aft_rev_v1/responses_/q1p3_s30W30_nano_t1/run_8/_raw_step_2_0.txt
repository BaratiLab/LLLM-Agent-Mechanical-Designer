Stress is safe (max 5.8 < 30). The main mass drivers are large-section members (area_id 3 and 4) and long members especially member_6 (11.3 mass). Members connecting node_5 increase mass without large stress benefits. Nodes 4 and 5 are high causing longer members. Load path complexity with node_5 and members 3,4,5 adds mass. Node_3 is load point but placed on bottom chord, reducing vertical load transfer efficiency. Existing nodes 1,2,3 fixed in place.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Removing node_5 and member_4 and 5 reduces mass. Lowering node_4 height and repositioning to increase triangular stiffness. Using minimal area members along low-stress parts. Use only necessary members forming stable triangles. Direct load path from node_3 to supports. Reducing member lengths and member sizes reduces mass.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_5 and members connected to it to simplify truss. Adjust node_4 vertical position down to 2.2 from 3.0 to shorten members. Connect members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_3 to form two triangles. Assign areas based on expected force: tension members smaller area, compression members larger area but minimal needed to keep stress below 30. Use area_id 2 (~0.782) or 1 (0.195) on low force members and area_id 3 (1.759) on high force.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular stable geometry ensures load transfer with minimum members. Shortening height of node_4 reduces member length and mass. Removing node_5 eliminates excess mass from extra members. Using smaller area members where stress allows. Expected mass sum from linear length * area approximately reduces from 39 to below 30 due to less material and shorter members. Stress stays within limits because geometry supports load effectively with pinned and roller supports at base nodes.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3 ~2m, node_3-node_4 ~3m, node_4-node_2 ~4.47m (diagonal), node_1-node_4 ~2.2m (vertical), node_2-node_3 ~4m (bottom chord). Assign areas to reduce mass but keep stress under limit by balancing tensile/compressive force distribution.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Calculate mass = ∑ length * area. Lengths calculated using distance formula. Check mass: (2*1.759)+(3*0.782)+(4.47*0.782)+(2.2*0.782)+(4*1.759) ≈ 3.518 + 2.346 + 3.494 + 1.72 + 7.036 = 18.114 (well under 30). Max stress estimated well under 30 based on previous stress with heavier members.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Structure simpler, lighter, with fewer members. No violation of constraints.
