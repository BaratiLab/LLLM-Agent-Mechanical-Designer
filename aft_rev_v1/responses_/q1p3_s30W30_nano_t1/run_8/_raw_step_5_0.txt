Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller (fixed y). Constraints max stress ±30, max mass 30. Current structure overshoots max stress (36.26) and mass (~9.2). Node_3 and node_4 positions fixed for load and support nodes; can add/move others except these. Areas limited to given discrete set. Must reduce stress in member_2 and member_4 mainly.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has excessive stress in \'member_2\' (-36.26) from node_3 to node_4 and \'member_4\' (33.38) from node_1 to node_4. Both members have small cross sections (areas 1 and 1 resp). Using larger areas helps but increases mass. Current total mass is acceptable (<30). Members with highest stress are short vertical/horizontal; needs optimized geometry to better distribute forces. Adding a new node higher above node_3 and connecting with diagonal members may reduce stress concentrations. Retain supports at nodes 1 and 2, load at node_3. Adjust node_4 upward for better force path, add node_5 between node_4 and node_2 to triangulate. Use moderate area sizes to minimize mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Avoid direct compression of members with low area. Adding diagonal member from node_1 to node_5, and from node_5 to node_2 should help redirect forces safely. Proposed five nodes total: node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4 (raised to ~2.4), and node_5 (new at ~4.0, 2.4). Appropriate area selections near \'3\' or \'4\' for high stressed members, smaller area for low-stress longer members.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (4.0, 2.4). New member connections: member_1: node_1-node_3, member_2: node_3-node_4, member_3: node_4-node_5, member_4: node_5-node_2, member_5: node_1-node_4, member_6: node_4-node_2, member_7: node_3-node_5. Use cross-section areas: member_2 and member_5 area \'4\' (3.128), longer diagonals \'3\' (1.759), shorter members \'2\' (0.782). This triangulation reduces bending and lever arms, lowering stress and mass remains below 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Raising node_4 and adding node_5 creates a stiffer triangle above base. This reduces bending moments at node_3 and node_4, splitting forces into better-supported members, lowering peak stress in member_2 and member_4. Diagonal members direct load towards supports efficiently. Using areas 3 and 4 balances mass and strength. Node_3 remains at original loading position to preserve load application. This layout exploits triangulation principle efficiently for 2D truss under inclined load.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0m, node_3-node_4 = 2.4m, node_4-node_5 = 2.0m, node_5-node_2 = ~2.4m, node_1-node_4 = ~2.4m, node_4-node_2 = ~4.0m, node_3-node_5 = ~2.83m.
