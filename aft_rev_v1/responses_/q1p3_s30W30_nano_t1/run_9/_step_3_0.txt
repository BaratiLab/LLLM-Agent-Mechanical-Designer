  "preamble": "Optimizing node_4 and node_5 placement and adjusting member area to reduce max stress while staying within mass and stress limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress ~29 close to limit ±30, total mass ~25.76<30. Load on node_3, supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Members mostly use area 2 or 3 except member_7 uses area 1 but has max stress.",
  "analysis": "Max stress concentrated on member_7 (node_5 to node_1) tension ~28.9. Other stresses safe margins. Member areas can be reduced on low-stress members while increasing area on member_7 to reduce stress. Node_5 moved closer to node_1 to reduce length of member_7 thus stress while keeping node_4 slightly modified for structural balance. The structure remains closed and stable. Mass constraint allows increasing some areas while decreasing others to stay within 30 limit.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing member_7 length by moving node_5 toward node_1 reduces stress there. Slightly increase area of member_7 from '1' to '2' or '3' to reduce stress below limit. Possibly reduce area on members with very low stresses like member_4. Need to re-check total mass after area changes.",
  "reasoning": "Stress force ∝ load / (area × length), by reducing length and/or increasing area, stress reduces. Need to keep mass under 30: mass = sum(length × area_factor). Carefully adjust node_5 position (x,y) towards node_1 along a vector, possibly (1.85,3.4) from (1.7,3.7). Make member_7 area '2' or '3'. Reduce area of lowest stress member_4 from '3' (1.759) to '2' (0.782) to compensate mass. This results in net stress reduction while mass maintains below limit.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Length member_7 before: dist((1.7,3.7),(0,0))=√(1.7²+3.7²)=~4.07. Move node_5 closer say (1.85,3.4) new length ~√(1.85²+3.4²)=3.89, reduces length 4.07→3.89. Area increase member_7 from 0.782 to 1.759 doubles cross section reducing stress ~half. Member_4 length ~ dist(node_1,node_4) = sqrt(2.3²+3.3²)=4.02. Reducing area from 1.759→0.782 drops mass by 4.02×(1.759-0.782)=~4.02×0.977= ~3.93 units of mass saved. Member_7 mass + length × (1.759-0.782)=3.89×0.977=3.8 added. Net mass saving about 0.13, overall mass ~25.6 <30 good.",
  "calculation": "Adjust node_5 to (1.85, 3.4) mean reducing length of member_7 to 3.89, increase member_7 area to '3'. Change member_4 area '2' reduces its mass. Other members keep area same. Improvement expected in max stress by reducing member_7 stress from ~28.9 to under 20 safely. Total mass estimated ~25.6 <30.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes or connections. Loads/support nodes unchanged node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed positions. Structure remains closed with members connecting nodes 1,3,5,4,2. Member areas updated: member_7 '3', member_4 '2', others unchanged.",
