Load and supports fixed, nodes for load/support not moved. Minor nodal adjustment from iteration 2 to 3 lowered max stress substantially from ~29 to ~9. Member areas optimized according to stress demands.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Max stress well below limit; mass near but below max. Member areas and nodal positions balance internal forces effectively. Further reducing stress likely increases mass or complexity disproportionately.",\n  "reasoning": "Stress and mass constraints both satisfied with current design. Large stress reductions already achieved by adjusting node_5 position. Member areas chosen to balance stress, leveraging areas 2 and 3 mostly. No members stressed near limits, no obvious stress concentration. The closed truss is geometrically stable. Further node movements risk passing stress or mass limits. Optimization trade-offs reached.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member stresses all between -9 and +5 approx. Areas mostly 2 or 3, largest member_mass on member_6 and member_7. Total mass <30, max stress <30. No load/support nodes moved. Node_5 adjusted slightly to reduce tension in member_7. Balanced compression and tension ensure stability and minimize peak stresses.",\n  "calculation": "No member stress exceeds ±30, no mass exceed 30. Node positions fine-tuned.
