  "preamble": "Optimizing 2D truss under load at node_3 with pinned and roller supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max stress ±30, max mass 30. Current max stress 38.3 exceeds limit on member_3. Mass 14.3 under max limit. Load is -10N at 45° downward left on node_3. Supports fixed at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller).",
  
  "analysis": "Current max stress 38.3 at member_3 (node_3 to node_1) exceeds tensile/compressive limit. Member_3 is short and small area (0.195), causing overload. Mass is low, so increasing area or changing topology is possible to reduce stress. Node_4 is at (2,3) connecting to node_1,2 and 3 with larger areas but stress low there. The triangular topology is minimal but insufficient to reduce stress on member_3. Load is pulling node_3 down-left, causing tension on member_3. To reduce stress, add a new node above node_3 to better distribute load and introduce additional load paths. Also, redesign member connections to reduce demand on member_3.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node above node_3 at about x=2, y around 4 to act as a support node. Connect new node to node_4 and node_3 forming two triangles sharing the upper node and node_4, redistributing force in members. Increase cross-section of key members to reduce stresses. Keep members from load/support nodes. Avoid long slender members to reduce stress. Maintain existing supports and load nodes fixed in place.",
  
  "proposal": "Add new node_5 at (2,4.0). Connect members: node_3-node_5, node_5-node_4, and possibly node_5-node_1. Adjust member areas as needed. Remove or reduce area on overstressed member_3 or redistribute to stronger members. Member_3 from node_3 to node_1 area increased to reduce stress if needed. Use areas from available set accordingly to keep mass under 30.",
  
  "reasoning": "New upper node allows better triangulation for load path. The force at node_3 is shared via node_5 to node_4 and node_1, reducing peak member stresses. Increasing area on critical members reduces stress by increasing capacity. Structural redundancy helps decrease stress concentration at member_3. Total mass remains under 30 due to conservative area choices. Node positions respect constraints and no change to support/load node positions.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and approximate areas to keep sum length×area < 30. Evaluate approximate stresses by load distribution considering added nodes and members. Use area ids 1 (0.195), 2(0.782), 3(1.759), 4(3.128), 5(4.887) for different members depending on length and stress demand. Members connected to supports carry more load and thus larger area. Short members with low loads can use smaller area to save mass.",
  
  "calculation": "Members lengths: node_1-node_3 ~2.0, node_3-node_5=1.0, node_5-node_4=1.0, node_4-node_1 ~3.6, node_4-node_2 ~4.0, node_2-node_3 ~4.0, node_5-node_1 ~4.47 approx. Assign areas: member_3 (node_3-node_1) area 2 (0.782) to reduce stress from 38.3 to ~25, members node_3-node_5 and node_5-node_4 area 2 (0.782) for load path, node_5-node_1 area 1 (0.195) as secondary. Other members keep or moderate areas to keep total mass <30. Summed mass estimate below 30 constraint.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no member stress exceeds ±30, total mass below 30, no duplicate nodes or members, all constraints met. Node positions precise floats, supports and load nodes unchanged.",
