  "preamble": "Current structure meets constraints with minimal stress; further improvement marginal.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objectives to minimize stress ≤±30 and mass ≤30 are currently met with max stress ~9 and total mass ~27.4.",
  "analysis": "Current design at iteration 3 satisfies max stress and mass constraints. Load and supports fixed, nodes for load/support not moved. Minor nodal adjustment from iteration 2 to 3 lowered max stress substantially from ~29 to ~9. Member areas optimized according to stress demands.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Max stress well below limit; mass near but below max. Member areas and nodal positions balance internal forces effectively. Further reducing stress likely increases mass or complexity disproportionately.",
  "reasoning": "Stress and mass constraints both satisfied with current design. Large stress reductions already achieved by adjusting node_5 position. Member areas chosen to balance stress, leveraging areas 2 and 3 mostly. No members stressed near limits, no obvious stress concentration. The closed truss is geometrically stable. Further node movements risk passing stress or mass limits. Optimization trade-offs reached.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member stresses all between -9 and +5 approx. Areas mostly 2 or 3, largest member_mass on member_6 and member_7. Total mass <30, max stress <30. No load/support nodes moved. Node_5 adjusted slightly to reduce tension in member_7. Balanced compression and tension ensure stability and minimize peak stresses.",
  "calculation": "No member stress exceeds ±30, no mass exceed 30. Node positions fine-tuned. Member lengths and areas producing acceptable mass. Stress distribution well balanced. No violations; optimization converged.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Design within constraints, further optimization unlikely to yield meaningful improvements without trade-offs. Stop optimization now.",
