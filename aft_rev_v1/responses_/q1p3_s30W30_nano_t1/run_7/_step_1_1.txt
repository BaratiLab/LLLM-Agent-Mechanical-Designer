  "preamble": "Current 2D truss satisfies constraints with low max stress and acceptable total mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 13.06 well below ±30 limit; total mass 25.11 below 30; load at node_3; fixed supports at node_1 and node_2; node_3 movable but currently at 2.0,0.0 is load point and cannot be moved; node_4 at (2.0,3.0) is free to move.",
  "analysis": "Member_1 carries highest compressive stress (-13.06), others significantly less. Mass distribution is moderate. Node_4 placement affects the internal triangle shape and force distribution. Load applied downward-left at node_3 induces bending moment. Support nodes and load node fixed; only node_4 can be repositioned to possibly reduce stress in highly loaded member_1 and improve load path.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Moving node_4 slightly horizontally or vertically to better align force flow and reduce peak stress. Potentially decreasing member_1 length or changing geometry can lower stress. Area assignments are near optimal: members carrying high stress have larger area. Member_1 area_id=2 (0.782), consider increasing/decreasing area but mass near limit, so better optimization by node_4 repositioning.",
  "reasoning": "To reduce member_1 stress (-13.061), improve force path from node_3 to supports. Node_4 vertical position influences triangle shape. Lowering node_4 may reduce bending moment at node_3 and redistribute forces. Keep node_4 moving on y-axis between 2.0 and 3.0 while x fixed at 2.0 (avoid x move per instruction). This could shorten member_4 and reduce mass, adjusting forces accordingly. Since mass is below limit, slight area adjustment can be feasible if stress allows. However, stress is well within limits so geometry change preferred.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: member_1 between node_1(0,0) and node_3(2,0) is 2.0; member_4 node_1(0,0) to node_4(2,y); decreasing y from 3 lowers member_4 length. This may alter force distribution and possibly reduce compressive stress in member_1. Area assignments mostly fixed given constraints. Areas: member_1 and member_2 have area_id=2 (0.782), member_3,4,5 have area_id=3 (1.759). No area changes to keep mass similar and avoid overstress. Evaluate node_4 at y=2.2 to 2.5 for balancing.",
  "calculation": "Set node_4 at (2.0, 2.3). Recalculate member lengths: member_4 length = sqrt((2-0)^2 + (2.3-0)^2) = sqrt(4 + 5.29) = sqrt(9.29) ≈ 3.048, less than old 3.605. Member_4 mass reduces. Member_1 unchanged length. Expected stress on member_1 reduces slightly due to better load path. Total mass reduces slightly. Max stress remains below limit. All constraints met.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_3 (load) and support nodes fixed; node_4 lowered to reduce stress in critical member_1 and member_4 mass. Areas kept constant to maintain structure and mass under limit. Final structure optimal within given constraints and minimal stress.",
