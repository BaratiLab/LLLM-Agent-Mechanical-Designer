    "preamble": "Optimize closed 2D truss with fixed nodes and supports under load, minimizing stress and mass within constraints.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Three existing nodes: node_1(0,0) pinned, node_2(6,0) roller, node_3(2,0) load point (-10N @ -45°). Need closed truss (all nodes connected) with max stress ±30 and max mass 30 (length*area sum). Areas from given discrete set.",
    
    "analysis": "Base truss is a line (flat): nodes on x-axis at 0, 2, 6. To form a closed truss, add a node above base to create triangles. Triangles optimize force paths, reducing stress. Place node_4 approximately above node_3 to form two triangles linking node_1, node_4, node_3 and node_3, node_4, node_2, giving a simple triangular truss. Area sizing must balance stress and mass. Load is downward-left, so members from node_3 upwards to node_4 and sideways to node_1 and node_2 will carry tension/compression. ",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) to form a triangle with node_1 and node_3 and node_2. Members: (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), (node_3-node_4), (node_1-node_4), (node_2-node_4). Check lengths, select areas starting small (0.782, 1.759) for tension members, larger if stress is high. Calculate axial force assuming static equilibrium, compute stress = force/area (area proportional to given areas). Assume unit modulus and density constants, focus on length*area for mass approx.",
    
    "reasoning": "Assuming static equilibrium and linear elasticity. Load on node_3 causes tension/compression in members. Closed triangular configuration distributes forces better, reducing max stress. Area selection based on approximate force magnitude: long members load likely higher stress, choose higher area. Verify sum(length*area) ≤ 30. Calculate member forces by resolving vertical and horizontal equilibrium at nodes. Use trigonometric projections for force in inclined members.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: consider node pairs. node_1(0,0)-node_3(2,0)=2; node_3(2,0)-node_2(6,0)=4; node_3(2,0)-node_4(2,3)=3 vertical; node_1-node_4 distance = sqrt(2²+3²)=3.605; node_2-node_4 distance = sqrt(4²+3²)=5.0. Approximate member force magnitudes: horizontal members bear reactions, vertical and diagonal members bear load components. Set area for (node_1-node_3)=0.782, (node_3-node_2)=0.782, (node_3-node_4)=1.759, (node_1-node_4)=3.128, (node_2-node_4)=3.128 for balanced stress.",
