Current max stress 36.6 > 30 allowed. Mass 21.78 < 30 allowed. Need stress reduction primarily. Node_4 and 5 used for bracing. Areas range 0.195 to 19.548 with length×area defining member mass.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current design fails max stress on member_7 (-36.6) compressive, close to node_4-node_5. Stress concentration likely due to member layout and force transfer. Member areas: member_7 is smallest area(1), higher stress indication under load transfer through node_5. Load at node_3 along 45° downward demands sufficient triangulation and probably thicker members near load path. Mass is within limit but stress violation critical. Node_5 used for intermediate bracing but stress remains high, indicating poor load path or insufficient member area.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress: increase member area on critical compressive member_7 or adjust geometry to decrease member length or forces. Possibly relocate node_5 to be more effective or add another node for better bracing. Avoid increasing mass significantly beyond 30. Member areas for high stress members can be increased up to 3 (1.759 area) or 4 (3.128 area) while monitoring total mass. Possibly remove or reassign members with less contribution. Member_7 area currently \'1\' (0.195) too small for 36.6 stress.",\n\n  "proposal": "Propose to keep support/load nodes fixed; relocate node_5 upward vertically closer to node_4 to reduce compressive stresses, increase area of member_7 and possibly members 4 and 6. Add diagonal from node_5 to node_2 to better triangulate. Increase member_7 area from \'1\'(0.195) to \'3\' (1.759). Increase member_6 (node_3-node_5) area to \'3\'(1.759). Add new member node_5 to node_2 with area \'2\'(0.782). Node_5 repositioned to (2.7, 2.4) from (2.7,1.8) to shorten member lengths and provide better force distribution. Recalculated mass expected below 30 with these adjustments.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Load acts downward-left at node_3. Force path from load to supports must be efficient. Current long member_7 under high compressive stress likely due to eccentric position of node_5. Moving node_5 vertically upward closer to node_4 reduces eccentricity and member length, thus stress. Adding member node_5→node_2 creates triangulation improving stiffness. Increasing critical members\' areas reduces stress by cross-section increase, balancing mass constraint. Triangulation avoids large bending moments and reduces critical stress points.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approximated: node_5-node_4 ~ sqrt((3.4-2.7)^2 + (3.0-2.4)^2) = sqrt(0.7^2 +0.6^2)= 0.92 m. Increasing area from 0.195 to 1.759 ≈ 9× cross-sectional area, drastically reducing stress. Adding node_5-node_2 length = sqrt((6-2.7)^2 + (0-2.4)^2) = sqrt(3.3^2 +2.4^2)= ~4.12 m. Area 0.782 moderate mass addition. Total mass estimated: doubled member_7 mass ~0.27* (1.759/0.195) ≈ 2.4, member_6 mass approx doubled to ~6, new member 5 ~ length*area =4.12*0.782=3.22.

Old member_7(0.27 at 0.195) → new member_7 ~0.92 *1.759=1.62, difference +1.35 mass. Member_6 old 3.4 mass with area 1.759 (old 3), slightly up from 1.759 old (3) to same. Add member_8 (node 5-node2): 4.12*0.782=3.22 mass. Total new approx: 21.78 -0.27 +1.62 + 3.22 + slight increase member 6 ~3.4 → total ≈ 26 max mass. Max stress estimated below 30 due to cross-section increase and shorter lengths.
