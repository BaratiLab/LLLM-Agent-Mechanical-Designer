Members 4,5,6 are heavy with large areas. Reducing member areas or reconfiguring nodes to shorten members may reduce mass. The structural layout seems stable but can be simplified by removing or shortening heavier members. Node_4 can be repositioned lower to reduce vertical member lengths and reduce area requirements. Member areas can be further optimized.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Need to maintain support and load nodes fixed. Node_4 can be moved to reduce total length. Member_2 and 3 areas can be reconsidered. Strategy: Lower node_4 and reduce area on heavier members while preserving stability and load path. Consider deleting member_6 (node_3 to node_4) if stable, or reducing its area.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Move node_4 lower to (3.4, 3.0).

This reduces member lengths and areas, aims for mass <=30 and stress within ±30.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Lowering node_4 reduces length of inclined members, can reduce required area and thus mass. Keeping node_3 connections with smaller areas reduces total mass. Area \'1\' (0.195) used for less loaded members minimizes mass. Area \'2\' for main bottom chord (node_1-node_2) maintains strength.
