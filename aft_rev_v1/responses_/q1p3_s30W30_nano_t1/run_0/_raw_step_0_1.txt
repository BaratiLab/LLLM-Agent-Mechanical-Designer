Load at node_3 is diagonal down-left. To resist load efficiently, a triangular or quadrilateral closed truss with vertical and diagonal members is suitable. Adding new nodes above x-axis will allow triangles, reduce tensile/compressive stress, and distribute load. Constraints suggest keeping total member length × area ≤30; thus, member cross-sections should be minimized while maintaining strength.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding one node above node_3 to form two triangles: (node_1, new_node, node_3) and (node_3, new_node, node_2) to close truss.
