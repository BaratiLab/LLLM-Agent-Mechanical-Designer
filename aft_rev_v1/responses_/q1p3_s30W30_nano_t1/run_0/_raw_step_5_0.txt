Current design has max stress > ±30 and mass is within limit. Must reduce stress mainly on members 2, 6.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current max compressive stress (-41.08) and tensile stress exceed ±30. Mass is low (13.16) allowing potential for larger areas or additional members for stress distribution. Load location fixed on node_3 at base; node_4 top position fixed to 3.4,3.0. Members with high stress are between node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, indicating load path concentration. Node topology is minimal and asymmetric in load carrying.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "History shows attempts with repositioning node_4 higher (to 3.4,3.5 or 3.7,4.0) lowered stress but mass exceeded limits. Member areas mostly small (area_id 1 or 2). Propose adding one more node between node_3 and node_4 to split load paths and adjust member areas carefully. Node_3 at 2.0,0.0 and node_4 at 3.4,3.0 fixed from input. Add node_5 around (2.7,1.8) to balance stresses. Use area_id 2 or 3 for heavily stressed members. Maintain existing primary nodes and supports.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node_5 at (2.7, 1.8) between node_3 and node_4 to split load. Members: node_1-node_2 (area 2), node_1-node_3 (area 2), node_2-node_3 (area 1), node_1-node_4 (area 3), node_2-node_4 (area 2), node_3-node_5 (area 3), node_5-node_4 (area 1), node_3-node_5 and node_5-node_4 reduce stress on node_3-node_4. Adjust member areas on critical members to keep stress <30. Total mass will be conservatively estimated under limit 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 creates a truss branch, distributing load, avoiding stress concentration on node_3-node_4 and node_1-node_3. Increasing area on node_1-node_4 and node_3-node_5 supports load transfer, while smaller area on node_5-node_4 keeps mass controlled. Keeping node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed position satisfies constraint 11. Using allowed areas ensures manufacturability and feasibility.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths between nodes, estimate mass as length × area factor.
