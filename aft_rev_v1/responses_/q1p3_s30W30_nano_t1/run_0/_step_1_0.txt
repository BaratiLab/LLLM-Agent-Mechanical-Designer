  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress and maintain closed truss under constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress is 10.05 < 30, mass 24.41 < 30; node_4 at (4,3) causes high stress in member_4 (node_1-node_4). Loads and supports fixed at nodes 1,2,3.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress in member_4 (10.05) is relatively high compared to others. Member_4 length = ~sqrt((4-0)^2+(3-0)^2)=5.0, area=2 => mass=3.91. High stress may be due to node_4 placement creating high axial force in member_4. Moving node_4 upwards or slightly left might better distribute forces, reduce stress in member_4. All members have moderate cross-sectional areas. Keeping closed shape and no duplicate nodes or members. Node_1, node_2 fixed at supports and node_3 fixed at load. Node_4 is only free node to move.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Moving node_4 up from (4,3) to (4,4) increases vertical height might reduce stress in member_4 by changing force angles. Check length increase for mass impact. Possibly reduce area in low stress members after recalculation.",

  "reasoning": "Increase height of node_4 to reduce compression in member_4, redistribute stress to members 5 and 6. Maintain connectivity: members remain the same, no added members to keep simplicity. Areas mostly 2 and 3, consider lowering members with very low stress to smaller area to reduce mass if possible. But main goal is stress minimization first. Slight node moves can significantly reduce peak stress. The load downward-left on node_3 creates tension/compression patterns. Moving node_4 up and slightly left can help balance these forces.", 
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current max stress=10.05 in member_4 at (4,3). Moving node_4 to (3.7,4.0). Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_4= sqrt(3.7^2+4^2)= approx 5.46 (increased length); member mass will increase marginally. This may redistribute force to member_5 and 6. Keep masses under 30. Keep areas same initially, can reduce after stress check if possible.",
  
  "calculation": "New node_dict: node_4 = (3.7, 4.0). Keep others fixed. Member connectivity unchanged. Areas unchanged (2 or 3). Expected member_4 stress reduction from reoriented load paths. Total mass expected slightly increased but still under 30.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes, connectivity unchanged, fixed nodes unchanged, closed truss confirmed. Constraints satisfied with anticipated stress reduction. No areas changed due to lack of exact FEM but focus on node movement to improve stress distribution.",
