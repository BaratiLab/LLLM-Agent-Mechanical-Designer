    "preamble": "Optimize closed 2D truss with given fixed nodes and loads, minimize stress, keep mass ≤30, stress ≤±30.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given 3 nodes with supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller), load at node_3 (-10N, -45°). Constraint: max stress ±30, max mass ≤30. Nodes node_1 and node_2 fixed at base, node_3 loaded at (2,0). Need closed truss, so plan to add nodes and members to form closed loops.",
    
    "analysis": "Current nodes lie on x-axis: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Load at node_3 is diagonal down-left. To resist load efficiently, a triangular or quadrilateral closed truss with vertical and diagonal members is suitable. Adding new nodes above x-axis will allow triangles, reduce tensile/compressive stress, and distribute load. Constraints suggest keeping total member length × area ≤30; thus, member cross-sections should be minimized while maintaining strength.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding one node above node_3 to form two triangles: (node_1, new_node, node_3) and (node_3, new_node, node_2) to close truss. Try placing new_node at (4,3) for a high enough triangle. Use small areas on compression members and medium on tension members based on load direction.",
    
    "reasoning": "1) Closed truss needed → new node above x-axis connected to 3 existing nodes. 2) Support at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller → minimal support reactions manageable. 3) Load at node_3 is diagonal, need members to resolve load components into axial members. 4) Use basic statics: axial force roughly proportional to projected load component over member length. 5) Keep mass low by choosing smaller sections for short members, larger section for critical members under load. 6) Stress = force / (area × allowable stress); fix max stress 30. 7) Check member lengths and area sum to keep mass ≤30.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: 1) Load at node_3 is -10N at -45°, components approx Fx = -7.07N, Fy = -7.07N. 2) Member lengths calculated by distance formula. 3) Axial forces approximated by resolving load in equilibrium. 4) Stress = axial force / section area. 5) Select areas from provided discrete set to keep stress ≤30. 6) Mass = sum(length × area). Use areas ≥1 for members under high load, smaller (0.195 or 0.782) for others.",
    
    "calculation": "1) New node (node_4) at (4.0, 3.0) to form triangle: distances -\n node_1-node_4: sqrt((4-0)^2 + (3-0)^2) = 5.0\n node_2-node_4: sqrt((6-4)^2 + (0-3)^2) = sqrt(4 + 9)=3.6055\n node_3-node_4: sqrt((4-2)^2 + (3-0)^2) = sqrt(4 + 9) =3.6055\n Existing base members:\n node_1-node_2: 6.0, node_1-node_3: 2.0, node_2-node_3: 4.0\n\n2) Members:\n - Base: node_1-node_2 area=0.782 (medium) for base stability\n - node_1-node_3: load line, area=3.128 (larger) to reduce stress\n - node_2-node_3: area=1.759 (medium)\n - Triangles: node_1-node_4 area=1.759, node_2-node_4 area=1.759, node_3-node_4 area=3.128 (to counter load)\n\n3) Approx axial force:\n - Load at node_3: -10N at -45°\n - Load resolved by members node_3-node_4 and node_1-node_3; node_3-node_4 under tension. \n - Stress check: force ≤ 30 × area → choose areas to keep stress < 30.\n\n4) Mass calculation:\n sum length × area = 6×0.782 + 2×3.128 + 4×1.759 + 5×1.759 + 3.6055×1.759 + 3.6055×3.128\n = 4.692 + 6.256 + 7.036 + 8.795 + 6.347 + 11.28 = 44.406 (too large)\n\n5) Reduce some areas to smaller values for light members:\n - Base: node_1-node_2 area=0.782\n - node_1-node_3 area=1.759\n - node_2-node_3 area=0.782\n - node_1-node_4 area=0.782\n - node_2-node_4 area=0.782\n - node_3-node_4 area=1.759\n Mass: 6×0.782+2×1.759+4×0.782+5×0.782+3.6055×0.782+3.6055×1.759\n=4.692+3.518+3.128+3.91+2.82+6.34=24.408 < 30 ✓\n\n6) Stress approx:\n - Max load force 10N → with area min 0.782 stress = 10/0.782=12.8 <30 ✓\n - Larger loads on node_3-node_4 and node_1-node_3 with slightly bigger area.\n\nClosed truss with 4 nodes and 6 members meets constraints with conservative area selection.",
