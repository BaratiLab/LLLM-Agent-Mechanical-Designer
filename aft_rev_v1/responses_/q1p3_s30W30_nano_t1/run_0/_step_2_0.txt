  "preamble": "Refining node_4 position and member areas to further reduce max stress while keeping mass under 30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 8.21 < 30, mass 26.85 < 30. Load at node_3(-10,-45). Supports fixed at nodes_1 and 2. Areas mostly 2 or 3, member_6 largest mass and stress negatively high.",
  "analysis": "Max stress reduced by moving node_4 from (4.0,3.0) to (3.7,4.0) and adjusting member areas accordingly. Member_4 is highest stress. Node_4 closer to load node_3 reduces moment arm and load transfer, meaning smaller stress expected. Member masses increased slightly increasing total mass. Options to reduce stress further by moving node_4 closer or changing areas to reduce stress in member_4 and member_6.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try moving node_4 slightly left/down to shift load path. Reduce area in low stress members to save mass. Increase area in high stress members carefully. Check if member_4 stress reduces.",
  "reasoning": "For improved stress distribution, node_4 shifted slightly toward node_3 and down to balance forces better. Areas revised to better allocate material, heavier cross-section in high load members (member_6), moderate in others. Maintain closed truss and no change in nodes 1,2,3 due to loads/supports.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4 candidate position: (3.5,3.5). Expected to reduce bending moments. Areas: member_4 area increased to 3 (1.759), member_6 increased to 4 (3.128), others decreased for mass balance. Total mass target ~28.",
  "calculation": "Calculate member lengths and stresses with moved node_4. Member lengths approximate: member_4 length ~ sqrt((3.5-0)^2+(3.5-0)^2)=4.95, member_6 length ~ sqrt((3.5-2)^2+(3.5-0)^2)=3.35. With increased areas for member_4 and member_6, expect reduced stress. Mass recalculated to remain below 30.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 at (3.5, 3.5), member areas chosen for stress redistribution and mass constraint. Members connected as before to keep closed 2D truss.",
