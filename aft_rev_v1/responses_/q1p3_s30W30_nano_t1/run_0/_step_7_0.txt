  "preamble": "Optimized 2D truss design iteration 6 satisfies constraints with minimized stress.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress is 11.75 < 30, and total mass is 27.33 < 30. Load at node_3, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Nodes with fixed load/support must remain fixed. Nodes 4 and 5 can move.",
  
  "analysis": "Stress levels are well below max allowed, with total mass under limit. Added node_5 and members form a closed truss with better stress distribution and no obvious stress hot spots. Member areas are larger on critical members (area_id=3 and 2 mostly) providing good stiffness and reduced stress. Node_5 repositioned upward at 2.7,2.4 balancing forces in members 6,7,8.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further moving node_5 slightly or adjusting areas could reduce stress marginally but risks mass increase or instability. Current configuration is balanced and efficient.",
  
  "reasoning": "All constraints satisfied: max stress ≤ 30, total mass ≤ 30. Using larger area members at force paths and node_5 position optimized to reduce peak stress. No members overstressed. Load and support nodes fixed as required. Closed truss topology maintained. Attempting further area reductions or node moves under constraints unlikely to yield significant improvement.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Checked member stresses and masses; member_2 at -11.75 is highest compressive stress, well below 30. Total mass is 27.33 < 30. Nodes 1,2,3 fixed. Node_4 at (3.4,3.0), node_5 at (2.7,2.4). Members connected logically: no duplicates, closed loop ensured.",
  
  "calculation": "Member lengths and cross-section areas consistent with member masses and given area dictionary. Stress calculations confirmed. No member violates stress or mass constraints. Node positions comply with load/support constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Final design meets all objectives and constraints. Further optimization will have diminishing returns and may degrade stability or increase mass.",
