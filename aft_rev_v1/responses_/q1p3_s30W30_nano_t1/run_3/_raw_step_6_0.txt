Current max stress ~8.17 and mass ~27.4. Nodes with loads/support fixed. Node_4 and node_5 can move. Areas mostly high for longer members.",\n  "analysis": "Max stress well below limits indicating potential for area reduction or slight node repositioning for improved stress distribution. Mass close to limit; reduce oversized areas where stress is low. Members between node_4 and others have low stress, suggesting overdesigned sections.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_3 and member_5 have area \'4\' (3.128) but low stresses (2.46 and -2.5).

Slightly move node_4 upwards and node_5 slightly left and down to better distribute forces and reduce bending/stress concentrations while maintaining closed truss. Keep node_3 load and nodes_1 & 2 support fixed. This can help decrease stress peaks and redistribute load path. Ensure no overlap or duplicate members.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check total mass after area reduction of member_3 and member_5 from \'4\': area mass factors: \'4\':3.128 to \'2\':0.782 reduces mass significantly.
