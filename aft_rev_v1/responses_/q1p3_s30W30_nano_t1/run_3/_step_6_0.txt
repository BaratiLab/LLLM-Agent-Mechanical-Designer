  "preamble": "Current 2D truss meets constraints; optimize stress further by refining node_4 and node_5 positions and adjusting areas.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max stress ±30, max mass 30. Current max stress ~8.17 and mass ~27.4. Nodes with loads/support fixed. Node_4 and node_5 can move. Areas mostly high for longer members.",
  "analysis": "Max stress well below limits indicating potential for area reduction or slight node repositioning for improved stress distribution. Mass close to limit; reduce oversized areas where stress is low. Members between node_4 and others have low stress, suggesting overdesigned sections.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_3 and member_5 have area '4' (3.128) but low stresses (2.46 and -2.5). Member_6,7,8 have area '1' (0.195). Member_1 area '3' (1.759) with moderate stress -8.17. Member_2 area '2' (0.782) with stress -5.07 and 4 has moderate stress 4.7109.",
  "reasoning": "Reduce areas on low-stress members 3 and 5 from '4' to '2' to save mass and balance stress. Slightly move node_4 upwards and node_5 slightly left and down to better distribute forces and reduce bending/stress concentrations while maintaining closed truss. Keep node_3 load and nodes_1 & 2 support fixed. This can help decrease stress peaks and redistribute load path. Ensure no overlap or duplicate members.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Check total mass after area reduction of member_3 and member_5 from '4': area mass factors: '4':3.128 to '2':0.782 reduces mass significantly. Reposition node_4 y from 1.7 to ~1.9. Node_5 from (2.8, 2.8) to ~ (2.6, 2.5) to shorten longer members and reduce bending. Expect stress reduction and mass < 27.",
  "calculation": "Member_3 length approx √((2.8-0)^2+(1.7-0)^2) ≈ 3.28; mass 3.28 × 3.128 =10.246. Changing area to '2' → mass 3.28 × 0.782 = 2.566. Similar for member_5. Shift node_4 and node_5 slightly to reduce member lengths of major members. Sum estimated new mass ~24.5, well below limit, stress should remain below 8.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Nodes 1,2,3 fixed. Move node_4: (2.8,1.9), node_5: (2.6,2.5). Change member_3 and member_5 areas to '2'. Maintain all other areas. Check no member duplicates and truss remains closed.",
