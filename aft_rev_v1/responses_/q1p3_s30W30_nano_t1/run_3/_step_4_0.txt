  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position and areas to further reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress is 11.94 < 30 limit and total mass 13.19 < 30. Load and supports fixed at node_1 and node_2, node_3 fixed by load. Node_4 movable. Areas currently mostly '2', one '3'.",

  "analysis": "Max stress is caused in member_3 between node_1 and node_4 (11.94). Members have moderate area assignments. Slight nodal adjustments of node_4 can improve force distributions and reduce peak stress. Reducing area of highly stressed members risks violating constraints; increasing area increases mass. Current stress is moderate, so fine tuning node_4 can reduce stress further, particularly reducing stress on member_3 and member_5 which is in compression (-9.72).",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_4 defined at (2.6, 1.52). Moving it slightly up and right can reduce stress in member_3 by reducing load path eccentricity. Area of member_3 can be reduced from '2' to '1' if stress reduces. Similarly, reduce area of member_5 from '2' to '1' if tension levels reduce. Studying member lengths to estimate mass accordingly. Stress distribution suggests balancing geometry can reduce max stress.",

  "reasoning": "By slightly increasing node_4 y-position and slightly shifting right, we shift force polygon improving axial stresses. This reduces tensile stress in member_3 and compression in member_5. Then reduce member_3 and member_5 area from '2' to '1' (0.782 area), reducing mass by ~50%. Other members hold area to keep structure strength. Mass after area changes stays below 30. Constraints for stress remain satisfied.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_4=(2.6,1.52) move approximately to (2.8, 1.7). New member length estimates: member_3 about sqrt((2.8)^2+(1.7)^2)=~3.3; member_5 approx distance between node_3(2,0) and node_4(2.8,1.7)=~1.86. Mass = length * area. Member_3: 3.3*0.782=2.58 (current 2.355), member_5:1.86*0.782=1.45 (current 1.28). Total mass remains below max limit. Reduced stress expected in these members due to geometry change.",

  "calculation": "Update node_4 to (2.8,1.7). Reduce area of member_3 and member_5 from '2'(0.782) to '1'(0.195). Keep other members same areas. Expect stress max to reduce to ~9-10 level and total mass ~11.5-12. Confirm stress limits and mass limits met.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 adjustment and area reduction expected to reduce max stress and mass while satisfying constraints and load/support boundary. No new nodes or members added to keep structure simple and closed. Continue optimization since max stress can be improved.",
