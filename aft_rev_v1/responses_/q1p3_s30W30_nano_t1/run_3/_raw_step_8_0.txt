Current max_stress = 40 > 30 limit, total_mass = 14.3 < 30 max mass.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design max stress on member_5 (-40) > 30 allowable. Mass is acceptable. Member_5 is short and low area (1) but overloaded. Stress likely due to load transfer path geometry. Node_5 added for stability but may be positioned inefficiently. Members connecting node_5 all small area (1).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress, increase cross-section area in highly stressed members or alter geometry to reduce force. Adding a supporting node higher than node_5 could help redistribute load and potentially reduce stress in member_5. Area adjustments should keep total mass <30.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add one more node upwards near node_5 location to create better force paths, reposition node_5 slightly upwards to improve load path. Increase area of critical members to reduce stress. Use areas judiciously to keep mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "The maximum stress in member_5 (connecting node_3 and node_4) is due to concentrated force and limited area. Member lengths and node locations affect internal forces. Increasing node_5 upwards and closer to nodes 4 and 3 redistributes force. Increasing area on member_5 and primary members sharing load paths will reduce stress. Use areas from the set provided (especially 2 or 3) to balance mass and strength.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Keep pinned/roller supports as is. Nodes 1,2,3 fixed. Node_4 keep near (2.8,1.7), move node_5 to (2.7, 3.5). Add node_6 at around (3.5, 3.8) to support node_5 and redistribute load. Members added: node_5 to node_6, node_4 to node_6, node_3 to node_6. Use higher areas for members: member_5 area=3, members connecting to node_6 area=2 or 3. Calculate approximate member lengths and masses to verify mass<30.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths: m5(node_3-node_4) ~1.9, m6(node_4-node_5) ~1.8, new m9(node_5-node_6) ~1.3, m10(node_4-node_6) ~1.3, m11(node_3-node_6) ~2.15. Mass approx: sum(length * area) with area=3 for m5(1.9*1.759=3.34), area 2 and 3 for others. Total mass approx <30. Expected max stress should reduce below 30 due to better load distribution and increased cross section.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Mass budget used for increased area members. Node additions create triangulated stable frames. Stresses should reduce as length of highly stressed members managed and load paths improved.
