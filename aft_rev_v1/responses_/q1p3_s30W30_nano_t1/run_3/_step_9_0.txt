  "preamble": "Optimized 2D truss with six nodes meets constraints on stress and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current design satisfies stress < ±30 and total mass <30. Max stress is 8.43 well under 30, total mass 24.15 under 30. Nodes for load/support fixed, other nodes well-placed.",
  
  "analysis": "Current structure has good distribution of stresses with max stress at 8.43 and total mass 24.15 below max allowed 30. Members areas selected appropriately. No overstressed members. The addition of node_6 improved load path distribution reducing stress. Further node movement could have minimal gains and risk was increase in stress or mass.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "No members are close to stress bounds or mass bounds. Structural layout is stable and nodes positioned to balance load. Minor stress improvements likely insignificant compared to effort and risk.",

  "reasoning": "Minimal member stresses indicate efficient load distribution. Areas for members with higher forces are properly sized to keep stresses low. Nodes for load and support fixed, so optimization only on intermediate nodes was done. Recent node_6 addition resulted in modest mass but stress reduction. Further refinement risks complexity without benefit.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress ranges from about -7.79 to +8.38 with ample margin from ±30. Mass utilization at ~80% of limit is reasonable, avoiding overdesign. Member connections form good load paths ensuring statically determinate sub-structures and closed truss geometry.",

  "calculation": "Observed max stress 8.43 << 30, total mass 24.15 < 30. No member exceeds area limits. Member mass breakdown consistent with areas and lengths. Resulting structure stable and optimal given constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Current solution well within constraints, stable, no overstressed members, no redundancy or excess mass. No further movement of free nodes improves outcome substantially, stopping optimization.",
