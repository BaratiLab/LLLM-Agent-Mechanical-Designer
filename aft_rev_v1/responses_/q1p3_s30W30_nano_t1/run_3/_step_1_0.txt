    "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under given load with stress and mass constraints.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 downward-left, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Max stress ±30, max mass 30. Current max stress 37 > 30, mass 13.8 < 30 acceptable. Need stress reduction mainly in member_5 and member_1.",

    "analysis": "Current design max compressive stress on member_5 (-37) and member_1 (-34) exceeds limit ±30. Member_6 carries small stress and large mass; may redesign to reduce member_6 size or remove if redundant. Triangular support with node_4 at (2.5,2.5) has small tension/compression but member_5 highly stressed. Load at node_3 near midspan causes bending; increasing height or redistributing members will reduce stress.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding a second intermediate node higher to form multiple triangulated sub-panels to reduce long member stresses. Change some member areas to larger sections in critical members, reduce in low-stress members. Possibly remove direct bottom chord member_6 between node_1 and node_2 since low stress but high mass.",

    "proposal": "Add a new node 'node_5' above node_3 at (2.0, 4.0). Remove member_6 (bottom chord node_1-node_2). Create members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_5, node_2-node_5, node_3-node_5, node_4-node_5. Keep node_4 at (2.5,2.5). Assign higher area to highly stressed members ('2' or '3'), reduce area to '1' or '0' for others.",

    "reasoning": "Raising node_5 adds vertical height and triangulation, reducing bending and member stresses around load at node_3. Removal of member_6 reduces unnecessary mass with minimal effect on stability since node_1 and node_2 are supported. Member areas adjusted to match stress demands. New topology better distributes load and reduces peak stress below limit.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Check geometry lengths: node_1-node_5 ~4.472, node_2-node_5 ~4.472, node_3-node_5 ~4.0, node_4-node_5 ~1.58. Areas chosen: critical members = '2' (0.782), moderate = '1' (0.195), light = '0' (1, baseline). Sum masses and members' stresses estimated to be below constraints.",

    "calculation": "Length/member mass approx = length * area_id mass factor; sum total mass to stay <30. Stress reduction from increased height and triangulation expected. Removed bottom chord decreases mass by ~6 units. Areas scaled to keep stress within ±30.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes/members. Positions fixed for load and supports. Member_6 removed. Areas comply with allowed set. Expect max stress < 30, total mass < 30.",
