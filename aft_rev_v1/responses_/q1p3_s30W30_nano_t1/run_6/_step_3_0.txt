  "preamble": "Optimize truss by repositioning free node to reduce max stress and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 6.7 < 30, mass 19.9 < 30; can reduce stress further by node reposition.",
  
  "analysis": "Node_4 is free and controls truss shape. Current areas push member_1 and member_3 higher area (3) and member_2,4 are area 2. Stress is low, but mass is higher due to area 3 usage. Adjust node_4 closer to balanced position reduces moments and can allow reduction in areas while keeping stresses low.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Lowering node_4 y from 2.3 to ~2.0 may reduce compression/tension in member_1 and member_3, allowing area reduction. Member lengths also impacted, total mass possibly reduced. Members 1 and 5 are under compression, member 3 tension; tune lengths to equalize stresses.",

  "reasoning": "1. Move node_4 from (2.3,2.3) to (2.2,2.0) to reduce height, shortening diagonal members. 2. Check stress: compression in member_1 reduces so area can be reduced from 3 to 2 (0.782 area). 3. Member_3 from 3 to 2 area also. 4. Maintain members 2,4 area 2 as stresses are moderate. 5. Member_5 area 3 maintains stability.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Estimate new length of members changing: member_1 length ~ sqrt((2.0-0)^2+(2.0-0)^2)=~2.828 vs current ~3.3, shorter means stress reduction. Member_3 length similarly shortened. Areas decreased from 3(1.759) to 2(0.782) cuts mass ~half on those members.",

  "calculation": "Current member_1 mass 3.518 with area 3 (1.759) and length ~2, reducing area to 2 (0.782) lowers mass to ~(2*0.782)=1.56. Similarly member_3 mass 5.72 to ~(2*0.782)=1.56. Total mass decrease ~6.1 units, new estimated mass ~ 19.8 - 6.1 = 13.7 well below max. Stress should remain below limits after shortening, lowering max stress.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Confirm no changes to loaded/supported nodes. No duplicate nodes or members. Closed truss maintained with connection 1-3, 2-3, 1-4, 2-4, 3-4.",
