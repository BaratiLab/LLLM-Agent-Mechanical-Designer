Mass (16.27) well below 30. Node_3, node_1 and node_2 fixed; node_4 moved from (2.0,3.0) to (2.5,2.5) reduced mass and stress from previous iteration but stress member_1 increased.",\n  "analysis": "High compressive stress on member_1 (-15.07) indicates member_1 is critical. Member_3 with larger cross-section area(3) has lower stress. Member_5 stress is moderate compression (-9.22). Moving node_4 closer horizontally seems to transfer stress to member_1. Decreasing vertical height of node_4 slightly from 2.5 to reduce lever arm might reduce stress in member_1 and balance forces. Need to reduce member_1 stress near zero while keeping total mass low and stresses within limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try moving node_4 slightly left (towards node_3) and lower vertically to 2.3-2.4 range from y=2.5. Keep node_3 at fixed (2.0,0). Possibly increase area of critical members (member_1) if needed to reduce stress but within mass limit.",\n  "reasoning": "Member_1 stress increase is linked to geometry forcing large axial force. By shifting node_4 closer to node_3 and reducing height, axial forces redistribute. Member_3 with larger area maybe area 3 is reasonable. Member_1 and member_5 currently area 2. Perhaps increase member_1 area from 2 (0.782) to 3 (1.759) to reduce stress. Trade off with mass optimality. Total mass limit is 30, current is 16.3, so room to increase cross-sectional area in critical members exists.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Keep supports fixed: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0); load fixed at node_3(2,0). Move node_4 from (2.5,2.5) to approx (2.3,2.3). Update member_1 area from 2 to 3, member_5 area from 2 to 3 for lower stress. Other member areas remain or slightly adjusted. Recalculate lengths for mass estimation and check stress qualitatively.",\n  "calculation": "Node_4 moved to (2.3,2.3): member_1 length = sqrt((2.3-0)^2 + (2.3-0)^2) = 3.25; member_3 length = sqrt((6-2.3)^2 + (0-2.3)^2) ~ 4.57; member_5 length = sqrt((2.3-2)^2 + (2.3-0)^2) = 2.3 approx. Mass revised: member_1 mass=3.25*1.759=5.71; member_5 mass=2.3*1.759=4.05; member_3 mass=~4.57*1.759=8.04 (some increase), total mass <30 still. Stress expected to reduce on member_1 from area increase. Horizontal position reduced height reduces axial forces. Member_4 remains area 2 to save mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no node duplicates, supports and loads fixed, area ids selected from set. Expect stress <=15 <30 and total mass under 30.
