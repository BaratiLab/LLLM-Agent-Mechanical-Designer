Areas correspond to cross-section sizes influencing stress and mass.",\n\n  "analysis": "The current nodes lie on x-axis with node_3 between node_1 and node_2. A closed truss requires at least a triangular or quadrilateral connectivity. To resist diagonal load (-10N, -45°) at node_3, members must provide vertical and horizontal reactions transferred to supports. Adding a node above node_3 to form a triangle will increase stiffness and allow load transfer. Avoid large cross-sectional areas to reduce mass but ensure stress limits are satisfied.

Use small areas for members along larger forces to control stress. Calculate lengths by distance. Assume stress σ = force / area; force ≈ axial force in member.

Supports at ends fix displacement horizontally and vertically (pinned) and vertically only (roller). Triangular configuration ensures geometric stability and closed form.
