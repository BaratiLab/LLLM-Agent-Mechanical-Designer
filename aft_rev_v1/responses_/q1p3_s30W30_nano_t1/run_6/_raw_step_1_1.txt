Currently, node_4 at (2.0,3.0) creates a tall, narrow triangle between nodes 1,3,4 and 2,3,4; spreading node_4 horizontally closer to node_3 (which is at 2.0,0.0) may reduce compression in member_1 and tension in member_3.",\n\n   "scratch_pad_2":"Try moving node_4 slightly right and downward, e.g. (2.5, 2.5) to reduce lever arm and compressive force on member_1; reduce area of member_5 from 4 to 3 or 2 to save mass and check stress; possibly reduce area in members with low stress (member_5), increase where stress is higher.
