  "preamble": "Closed 2D truss with 4 nodes optimized over iterations for stress and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max stress ±30, max mass 30; current max stress ~14.23 and mass ~12.82 are well below limits. Nodes with loads/support fixed; only node_4 movable. Member areas currently all '2' (0.782 area).",
  
  "analysis": "Current design places node_4 near (2.15, 2.5), resulting in relatively low max stress and total mass about 12.8. Max stress and mass are significantly below constraints, indicating a balanced structure. No member is highly overstressed or underutilized. Historical trends show attempts to raise/lower node_4 for better stress distribution were made; stresses shifted but minimal benefits beyond iteration 6. Member areas are uniform; some stress variation suggests limited improvement by changing areas here without increasing mass or violating constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing node_4 height increased stresses; lowering reduces force in top chord but affects stability. Area '2' provides good balance between mass and strength. Attempts to change node_4 position within boundaries reflect small perturbations insufficient for big gain. Members connecting to node_3 and node_4 have compressive stresses near -9 to -14, already modest.",
  
  "reasoning": "Further movement of node_4 risks compromising geometric stability or increasing stresses due to load path changes. Uniform area '2' balances mass and strength without overdesign. Max stress is less than half allowable limit (30). Reducing stress further likely requires complex geometry or additional nodes/members, which are not allowed. Current closed shape is stable and balanced. Therefore, the optimum design is reached here with current nodes and member sections.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Area '2' = 0.782; member lengths ~vary but total mass ~12.8 < 30. Max stress ~14.23 << 30. Load at node_3 with direction -45°. Supports fixed. Node_4 adjusted to slightly lower and right. Changes optimized stress distribution but gains marginal beyond iteration 6.",
  
  "calculation": "No further benefit found by small changes around node_4 position. Maintaining areas at '2' keeps mass low. Max stress already well within limits. Total mass ~12.82 < 30 constraint. Hence, no reallocating member areas or adjusting node positions warranted. Structure is optimized given constraints and input conditions.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verified constraints satisfied. Max stress and mass well below limits. Supports/load positions fixed. Closed truss with minimal members and simple geometry. Further iteration unlikely to improve. Stop optimization.",
