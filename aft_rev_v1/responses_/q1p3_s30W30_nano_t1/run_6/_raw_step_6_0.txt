Members mainly area=2; goal to reduce max stress by repositioning node_4 only.",\n  "analysis": "Stress concentrates in member_1 (-14.8 compressive) and member_5 (-9.1 compressive). Member areas uniform (area 2). Node_4 controls top geometry; adjusting node_4\'s position can rebalance member forces reducing max stress while maintaining mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing node_4 height marginally reduces compressive stress in member_1 but increases member_3 tension and member_4 stress. A balance is needed between height and horizontal to balance stresses on longer members.",\n  "reasoning": "Minimize max stress by shifting node_4 to reduce overloaded member length and change force paths. Move node_4 slightly upward and left (reduce horizontal from node_3) to reduce member_1 compressive stress. Lower area sizes kept to keep mass low. Keeping all member areas at \'2\' balances minimal mass with stiffness. No area change recommended this step to avoid complexity.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_4 at (2.3, 2.4). Shift left to ~2.15 and slightly up to ~2.5. This shortens member_1 length, possibly reducing stress. Keep node_3 at (2,0). Check member lengths and stress approx:",\n  "calculation": "Member_1 length: from node_1 (0,0) to node_3 (2,0) = 2.0, unchanged. Member_3 length from node_1 to new node_4 at (2.15, 2.5) ~ sqrt(2.15² + 2.5²) = ~3.29 instead of prior ~3.732, reduces member_3 length and stress. Member_5 length (node_3 to node_4) ~ sqrt((2.15-2)^2 + (2.5-0)^2) ~ sqrt(0.0225 + 6.25) = ~2.51, member_5 length reduced from previous ~2.4 to ~2.51 marginally higher. Overall structural stiffness improved for member_1 and 3 reducing max stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Maintains constraints: max stress <30, mass <30 with member areas same (2).
