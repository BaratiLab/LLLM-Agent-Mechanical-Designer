  "preamble": "Optimize truss by relocating free node to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 (-10, -45 deg), supports fixed; max stress ±30, max mass 30; current max stress ~15.67, total mass ~13.9, areas mostly 2 or 3; node_4 moved down to (2.2,2.0).",
  
  "analysis": "Max compressive stress in member_1 is highest at -15.67; tensile stresses are moderate. Member_1 is connected from pinned node_1 (0, 0) to node_3 (2, 0) and has area '2'. Nodes 1,2,3 fixed; only node_4 (free node) can be moved. Current node_4 position (2.2,2.0) is low compared to previous (2.3,2.3). Lowering node may increase compressive stress in member_1. Current design mass below limits.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing node_4 height may better distribute load, reduce member_1 compression. Also, adjusting node_4 x-coordinate slightly right could reduce high stresses. Maintain closed configuration with members linking node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4.",
  
  "reasoning": "To reduce max compressive stress on member_1, raise node_4 to reduce load concentration; slightly shifting node_4 right may balance stress distribution. Keep member areas minimal where possible to reduce mass, but member_1 already area '2', minimal for compression. Current member_5 area '3' seems fine. Maintain member connections unchanged. Consider new node_4 position ~ (2.4, 2.5).",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_3 fixed at (2.0, 0.0), members 1 and 2 from nodes 1 and 2 to node_3 horizontal line. Raising node_4 will increase triangle area, reducing forces in member_1. Checking mass = sum(length * area) with areas fixed, length increase from node_1 to node_4 less than increase impact. Expect mass < 30 and max stress well under 30.",
  
  "calculation": "Old node_4 (2.2,2.0), new candidate (2.4, 2.5). Length node_1-node_4: sqrt(2.4^2 + 2.5^2)=3.46; area=2; mass ∝ 6.92. Previously approx sqrt(2.2^2+2^2)=2.97*2=5.94 mass units. Increase slight, total mass still below limit. Expect member_1 compression to drop below current -15.67. Adjust member_5 area kept at '3', others same.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Check no duplicate nodes/connections, node_4 repositioned within design freedom, members unchanged besides areas consistent. Load/support nodes fixed. Constraints satisfied.",
