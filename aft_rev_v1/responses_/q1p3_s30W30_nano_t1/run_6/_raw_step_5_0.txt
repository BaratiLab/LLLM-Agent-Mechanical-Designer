Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed nodes at node_1, node_2 also fixed. Only node_4 movable. Member areas mostly \'2\', except member_5 is \'3\'.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Node_4 is currently at (2.4, 2.5). Max compressive stress occurs in member_1 (-14.8), tensile highest in member_3 (8.35). Mass distribution fairly balanced. History shows raising node_4 height generally improves stress but increases mass due to member_5 length. Consider slight horizontal shift of node_4 towards node_3 (which is at 2.0,0.0) to reduce compression in member_1 and tensile in member_3. Also consider changing area of member_5 from 3 to 2 to reduce mass, as its stress is -4.07 (far from max allowed). Reassign member_3 area up or down to balance stress if needed.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_4 modifications can control triangles shape affecting stress in all members connected to it. Areas can shift from member_5 to member_3 or vice versa to get better stress distribution. Geometry plus area sizing both play role. Small horizontal moves feasible as node_3 fixed at (2,0)",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 horizontally slightly left to reduce axial force range in members connecting node_4 and node_1/node_3 might reduce max stress in member_1 and 3. Keeping similar or slightly lower height to avoid large member_5 length to keep mass low. Adjust member_5 area to 2 reduces mass and stress safety margin remains. Slightly increase member_3 area if member_3 tensile stress remains high. Maintain member_1 & 2 areas for compression members to avoid buckling risk. This approach balances stress and mass within constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Inputs: node_4 x from 2.4 down to about 2.2-2.35, y from 2.3-2.5 to control member lengths. Areas: member_5 from \'3\' (1.759) to \'2\' (0.782) reduces mass by ~1.9 units. Check stress changes. Members 1,2,3,4 areas mostly \'2\' at 0.782 suitable for moderate stress. Member_3 possibly increase from \'2\' to \'3\' if tensile stress far from limit.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Shift node_4 to (2.3, 2.4) effective balance of height and horizontal position. Change member_5 area from \'3\' to \'2\'. Evaluate expected mass drop: member_5 mass ~4.45 (area 1.759), changing area to 0.782 reduces mass ~ (4.45 * 0.782/1.759) =~ 1.98 approx mass. Total mass ~15.28 - 2.47 = 12.81 approx. Expected small increase in stresses in member_5 due to smaller area but still below limit.
