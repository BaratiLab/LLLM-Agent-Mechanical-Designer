Member_1 is connected from pinned node_1 (0, 0) to node_3 (2, 0) and has area \'2\'. Nodes 1,2,3 fixed; only node_4 (free node) can be moved. Current node_4 position (2.2,2.0) is low compared to previous (2.3,2.3). Lowering node may increase compressive stress in member_1. Current design mass below limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing node_4 height may better distribute load, reduce member_1 compression. Also, adjusting node_4 x-coordinate slightly right could reduce high stresses. Maintain closed configuration with members linking node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "To reduce max compressive stress on member_1, raise node_4 to reduce load concentration; slightly shifting node_4 right may balance stress distribution. Keep member areas minimal where possible to reduce mass, but member_1 already area \'2\', minimal for compression. Current member_5 area \'3\' seems fine. Maintain member connections unchanged. Consider new node_4 position ~ (2.4, 2.5).",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_3 fixed at (2.0, 0.0), members 1 and 2 from nodes 1 and 2 to node_3 horizontal line. Raising node_4 will increase triangle area, reducing forces in member_1. Checking mass = sum(length * area) with areas fixed, length increase from node_1 to node_4 less than increase impact.

Previously approx sqrt(2.2^2+2^2)=2.97*2=5.94 mass units. Increase slight, total mass still below limit. Expect member_1 compression to drop below current -15.67.
