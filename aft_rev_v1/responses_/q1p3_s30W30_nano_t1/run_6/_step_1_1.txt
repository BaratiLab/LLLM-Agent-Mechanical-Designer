   "preamble":"Optimize truss to reduce max stress under constraints.",
   "scratch_pad_1":"Current max stress is 13.06 well below ±30, total mass 20.81 below 30 max; members mostly area_id 2 or 4; node_3 is load, nodes 1 and 2 fixed supports; can only move node_4 (2.0,3.0).",

   "analysis":"Max stress on member_1 (-13.06) is significant; member_5 (area 4) has low stress (-2.26) but large mass contribution; balance area assignments and nodal position to reduce high stress; member_1 (node_1 to node_3 on bottom chord) is in compression, reducing length or force there helps; node_4 can move vertically/horizontally to redistribute forces in diagonals and vertical members. Currently, node_4 at (2.0,3.0) creates a tall, narrow triangle between nodes 1,3,4 and 2,3,4; spreading node_4 horizontally closer to node_3 (which is at 2.0,0.0) may reduce compression in member_1 and tension in member_3.",

   "scratch_pad_2":"Try moving node_4 slightly right and downward, e.g. (2.5, 2.5) to reduce lever arm and compressive force on member_1; reduce area of member_5 from 4 to 3 or 2 to save mass and check stress; possibly reduce area in members with low stress (member_5), increase where stress is higher. Ensure mass stays under 30.",

   "reasoning":"By moving node_4 closer to node_3 horizontally and reducing vertical height, compression in member_1 might reduce; lowering height reduces bending moment from load at node_3; member_5 diagonally carries less load if triangle flattened; decreasing area in member_5 reduces mass; member_1 still keeps moderate area to avoid buckling; careful area selection from given table to keep stresses ≤30; all loads/supports fixed, node_4 only free parameter.",

   "scratch_pad_3":"Calculate approximate member lengths to update mass: member_1 length ~distance(node_1,node_3)=2.0, member_5 length ~distance(node_3,node_4) reduced from sqrt(3²+0²)=3.0 to smaller value (~sqrt(0.5²+2.5²)=~2.55). Mass=sum(length*area); adjusting area IDs accordingly; keep member_1 at area '2'=0.782, member_5 reduce from '4'=3.128 to '3'=1.759 or '2'=0.782.",

   "calculation":"New node_4 at (2.5, 2.5); recalc lengths: member_1 length=2.0 (fixed), member_5 length=√((2.5-2.0)²+(2.5-0.0)²)=√(0.25+6.25)=2.55; mass member_5=2.55*area (try area 2=0.782) =1.99 (down from 9.384), mass member_1=2.0*0.782=1.564; total mass decreases substantially; expect lower stress in member_1 due to reduced moment; keep members_2,3,4 area at 2 or 3 based on stress profile; increment area for member_3 to 3 if needed to resist tension.",

   "scratch_pad_final":"Verify no duplicates; node_4 moved, load/support nodes unchanged; areas chosen from allowed set; mass under 30; maximum stress likely reduced; stop=False for one more iteration since possible improvement.",
