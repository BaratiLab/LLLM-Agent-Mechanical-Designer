  "preamble": "Optimize node 4 position and member areas for lower max stress and mass under constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints max stress ±30 and mass ≤30; current max stress 7.96, mass 27.24; load at node_3, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller); node_1 and node_2 fixed, node_4 movable.",
  "analysis": "Current max stress is well below limit with balanced tensile/compressive values; mass close but under 30; member_3 area reduced from 3 to 2 lowered stress but member_4 area increased to 3 increased mass; node_4 coordinate shifted between exploration iterations for reduced max stress.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_4 slightly upward and left to better distribute stress between members 3 and 4; consider reducing member_4 area from 3 to 2 to lower mass if stress allows, while keeping member_3 at area 2 or 3 depending on stress distribution.",
  "reasoning": "Node 4 acts as top joint bearing vertical and inclined members; shifting node_4 closer to node_3 vertically redistributes load in member_4; smaller area on highly stressed members reduces mass but increases stress; balance needed by slight reposition plus area tuning within given discrete area set.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Candidate node_4 positions tested previously: (3.1,3.6) good stress but mass 27.24, (3.2,3.4) slightly less mass but higher stress; reducing member_4 from area 3 to 2 reduces mass by ~3 but stress on member_4 may increase from -4.20 to near -9.5; try member_3 area=3, member_4 area=2; move node_4 to (3.0,3.7) to test balance.",
  "calculation": "Try node_4=(3.0,3.7). Member lengths: m3 approx sqrt((3-0)^2 + (3.7-0)^2)=approx 4.73, m4 approx sqrt((3.0-2.0)^2+(3.7-0)^2)=approx 3.77. Mass: m3=4.73 * area(3=1.759)=8.32, m4=3.77 * area(2=0.782)=2.95. Mass reduced ~3.7 for m4 compared to previous iteration while keeping m3 area large to reduce stress. Expected max stress improved possibly below 7. Switching member_1 to area 3 (from 4) saves ~2 mass and small stress increase acceptable as m1 stress is low (-3.55).",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Updated node_4 and reduced member_4 area from 3 to 2, slightly reduced member_1 area; expect max stress <8 and total mass ~25 to 26; all constraints satisfied.",
