Node_4 moved from (3.5,4.0) to (3.2,3.4), reduced mass and stress. Consider fine tuning node_4 near (3.0-3.3, 3.3-3.6) to further reduce member_4 stress. Member areas on most highly stressed members could be optimized by slightly increasing or redistributing.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Potential to reduce member_4 stress by adjusting geometry slightly; slight increase in member_4 area or transfer to more efficient force paths; small nodal moves for improved force distribution; areas range used: member_1 at max (4), member_2 and member_3 moderate, member_5 smaller. Aim to reduce member_4 compression by slight node_4 reposition.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Highest stress is compressive in member_4. Geometrically shortening or changing angle of member_4 can reduce force. Because node_1 and node_2 fixed, only node_4 moves feasible. Increasing member_4 area could reduce stress but increases mass, optimize trade-off by minimal increase and geometry adjustment. Possibly reduce area on less stressed members to compensate mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member forces proportional to axial stiffness EA/L; shorter length or larger area reduces stress. Current area for member_4 is \'2\' (0.782). Slightly increasing this to \'3\' (1.759) doubles axial stiffness, can reduce stress. Compensate by reducing area on member_3 from \'3\' to \'2\'. Adjust node_4 coordinates slightly left and up to reduce leverage forcing compression in member_4.",\n\n  "calculation": "Shift node_4 from (3.2, 3.4) to approx (3.1, 3.6), area changes: member_4 from \'2\' to \'3\' (0.782 → 1.759), member_3 from \'3\' to \'2\' (1.759 → 0.782), member_5 keep at \'2\'. Member_1 and member_2 unchanged. Mass recalculated approximate: member_4 mass ~ 3.34 → 6.7 (approx), member_3 mass 8.21 → 3.66, net mass change ~ +2.4 -4.5 = -2.1, total mass ~ 25.66 under 30. New stress expected reduction in member_4 compressive stress by about half (to ~-4.8).",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Proposed changes reduce max stress below current 9.59 while maintaining mass below 30, respecting constraints.
