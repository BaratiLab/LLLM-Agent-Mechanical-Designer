  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss with minimal stress under given load, supports, max stress ±30, and mass ≤30.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0); load at node_3 (-10 N at -45°); supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Goal: closed truss with all nodes connected, no node movement. Area choices limited and mass constraint is sum of length*area ≤30.",
  
  "analysis": "The initial 3 nodes lie along the x-axis: node_1 at origin, node_2 at (6,0), node_3 at (2,0) under diagonal downward load. Currently colinear nodes lead to a mechanism (no rigidity). A closed truss requires at least a triangle. To close the truss and increase stiffness without moving nodes, add at least one additional node off the x-axis to form a stable triangle or polygon. The new node placement must keep total mass ≤30 and satisfy stress limits. Use member connections forming triangles including the new node.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 above node_3 at y>0 (example at y=3) to form two triangles: (node_1 - node_3 - node_4) and (node_3 - node_2 - node_4). Connect node_4 to node_3, node_2, and node_1 to close the truss. Select member areas prioritizing lower areas to save mass, increase area where stresses expected high. Load at node_3 introduces compression/tension forces, use simple static equilibrium for member force approximations. Aim for symmetric load paths.",
  
  "reasoning": "Adding node_4 at (2,3) forms two triangles sharing node_3, triangulating the truss and increasing stability. Members: (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), (node_1-node_4), (node_4-node_3), (node_4-node_2). Check member lengths, assign areas to limit stress ≤30 with tensile and compressive check. Use approximate axial force calculation from simple static equilibrium and trigonometric relations. Assume linear elastic axial stress: stress = force/(area). Members with longer length must have adequate area to keep stress under limit and preserve mass budget.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: n1-n3=2m, n3-n2=4m, n1-n4=√(2²+3²)=3.6056 m, n3-n4=3 m, n4-n2=√((6-2)²+3²)=5 m.\nSelect area IDs from set {0=1,1=0.195,...}: try low to medium areas to keep mass and stress balanced.\nAssuming load -10N at 45° downward on n3, approximate reaction forces at supports (node_1 pinned, node_2 roller), then member forces from joint equilibrium.\nMass calculation = Σ(length × area). Ensure sum ≤30.",
