  "preamble": "Optimize truss to minimize stress and mass within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 13.5 < 30, mass 17.74 < 30; load at node_3; support at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Node_4 movable; members connect 4 nodes with mixed areas.",

  "analysis": "Max stress is moderate but member_1 is highly stressed (-13.5, compressive). Member_2 low area leading to tension stress (-9.89), member_3 area high but low stress (3.33). Suggest resizing members and repositioning node_4 for stress distribution.", 
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 length ~ distance(node_1-node_3)=2 units; area 2 (0.782) in iteration_7. Member_2 area 1 (0.195) is small; consider increasing area to better handle tension. Node_4 raising Y from 3.7 to 3.85 improved stress, further adjustments may help.",

  "reasoning": "To reduce max compressive stress in member_1, increasing area or reducing length is effective. Cannot move node_3 (load) or support nodes, only node_4 movable. Slightly lowering node_4 reduces member_3 length and mass. Increasing member_2 area to 2 or 3 reduces tension. Member_1 area reduced to 1 (0.195) may cause high stress. Tradeoff between area increase (mass) and stress reduction needed.", 
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: member_1: dist(node_1-node_3)=2m; member_2: dist(node_3-node_2)=4m; member_3: dist(node_1-node_4)=sqrt(2.85²+3.85²)=approx. 4.8m; member_4: dist(node_4-node_3)=approx 2.03m; member_5: dist(node_4-node_2)=approx 3.18m. Member mass = length x area from given table. Try increasing member_2 area to 2 or 3, reduce member_1 area from 2 to 1 or 2; keep member_3 area 3; member_4 and 5 area 2 or 3 for stress balance.",

  "calculation": "Proposed updates: member_1 area 1 (0.195) to reduce mass but carefully check stress; member_2 area 3 (1.759) to reduce tensile stress; member_3 area 3 (1.759) stable; member_4 area 2 (0.782); member_5 area 2 (0.782). Move node_4 slightly down from (2.85,3.85) to (2.8,3.75) to reduce height thus member_3 length and moderate compression in member_1. This should reduce max stress and mass balance.", 
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify final design: max stress <30, total mass <30. Only node_4 moved precisely. No duplicate members, all members connect existing nodes. Area choices respect table. Structure remains closed with 5 members.",
