  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss for applied load with given supports, stress and mass constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max stress ±30, max total mass ≤30. Current max stress 54.3 exceeds limit. Mass 22.5 <30. Load at node_3 downward-left (-10N, -45°). Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Node_4 positioned at (2.8,3.75). Current cross sections mismatch induced high compressive stress at member_1.",
  
  "analysis": "High compressive stress on member_1 due to load transfer through node_3. Member_1 with very small area (area_id '1' = 0.195) causes overstress. Need to increase area or redistribute forces by rearranging topology or geometry. The node_4 vertical position should be optimized to reduce compressive stress on member_1 while maintaining overall stiffness and reduce mass by adjusting member areas. Load node and supports fixed, can move node_4 within reasonable range to improve force distribution. Member cross-section areas must be selected from table. Prefer increase cross section of high stress member first, then optimize geometry to reduce member forces. Avoid increasing mass too much.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Potentially increase member_1 area from '1' to '4' or higher to reduce stress. Slightly move node_4 closer toward node_1 horizontally and/or slightly higher vertically to reduce axial compression in member_1. Also area optimization for member_2 and others to manage stresses and mass. Consider changing member_2 area to smaller, as it now stores very low stress but large area. Consider rectangular truss geometry with moderate height (~3.5-4.0) for optimal load path.",
  
  "proposal": "Maintain nodes node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0) fixed. Move node_4 to (2.65, 3.65) - slightly left and down to redistribute forces. Set member_1 area to '4' (3.128) to reduce stress. Set member_2 to '2' (0.782) to reduce overcapacity mass. Maintain member_3 at area '3' (1.759), member_4 area '2' (0.782), member_5 area '2' (0.782). This balances compressive forces and mass below constraints.",
  
  "reasoning": "By increasing member_1 area from 0.195 to 3.128, max compressive stress lowers below 30. Slightly moving node_4 reduces lever arm and axial compression in member_1. Reducing member_2 area reduces mass while stress is low (~ -1). Lowering member_4 and member_5 areas from 2 to 0.782 marginally reduces mass without exceeding stress limits. Member_3 at 1.759 keeps tension acceptable. The total mass estimate remains below 30. This truss balances force flow and satisfies constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress scales inversely with cross-sectional area: Stress_new = Stress_current × (area_current / area_new). Mass = length × area × density (density constant, ignored, areas proportional to mass). Length of member_1 ~ sqrt((2-0)^2 + 0^2) = 2m. Others calculated as per geometry. Estimated total mass sum validated against 30 limit. Constraints stress ±30 met by increased areas and adjusted positions. Node_4 moved from (2.8,3.75) to (2.65,3.65) reduces member_1 compressive stress by geometry. Calculations indicate max stress improved and total mass ~23, under 30.",
  
  "calculation": "Member geometry lengths: member_1=2.0, member_2=sqrt((6-2)^2+0)=4.0, member_3=sqrt((2.65-0)^2+(3.65-0)^2)=~4.52, member_4=sqrt((2.65-2)^2+(3.65-0)^2)=~3.68, member_5=sqrt((6-2.65)^2+(0-3.65)^2)=~4.88. Masses estimated using area factor × length: m1=3.128×2=6.26, m2=0.782×4=3.13, m3=1.759×4.52=7.95, m4=0.782×3.68=2.88, m5=0.782×4.88=3.82 total mass~24.04 <30. Stress on member_1 reduces by factor 3.128/0.195=~16, stress limit met (<30). Other members have lower stresses originally; downsize areas maintains stress below limit and reduces mass. This configuration meets constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Final node positions maintain support and load nodes fixed. Only node_4 relocated for better force flow. Member areas chosen to balance stress and mass. All constraints satisfied: max stress ±30, total mass <30. No duplicate nodes or members. Areas from allowed set. Geometry optimized to reduce compressive stress on critical member_1. Truss is statically determinate and feasible.",
