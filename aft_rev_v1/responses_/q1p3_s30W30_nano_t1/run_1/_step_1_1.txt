  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to reduce max stress under given constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 20.15 < 30, mass 27.25 < 30. Objective: reduce max stress further, mainly in member_5 (20.15 tensile). Node_1 and Node_2 fixed due to supports/load, Node_3 and Node_4 movable.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_5 (node_4 to node_2) has max tensile stress (20.15). Its length is short (distance ~ sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-3)^2) = 5), area currently 0.195 (area_id=1). To reduce stress: increase area or reduce force in member. Increasing area raises mass; we have limited margin (2.75 mass left). Adjusting node_4 position can better distribute forces and reduce stress in member_5. Consider moving node_4 horizontally towards node_2 or slightly upwards to change geometry and internal forces. Also, member_2 has low compressive stress (-1), possibly its area (4 = 3.128) can be reduced (slight mass saving). Member_4 also low stress (-2.26), area 4 (3.128) could be trimmed and reallocated.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on shifting node_4 right/up preserving the closed truss geometry, reduce cross-section area of low-stress members, slightly increase area of high stress member_5 if needed but limited by mass budget.",
  
  "reasoning": "Max stress reduction obtained by geometry optimization: move node_4 closer or above node_2 to reduce tension in member_5. Decreasing areas in low stress members maintains mass budget. Current shape: triangle + internal members to distribute load. Load at node_3 (-10 at -45°) creates tension in member_5; changing node_4 position redistributes internal forces. Maintain member connections to keep closed truss. Areas selected from given set; improve balance by swapping area of member_5 to area '2' or '3' (to handle tension better).",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Distances: node_4 to node_2: from (2,3) to (6,0) length ~5. Move node_4 -> (4.0, 3.5) to shorten member_5 and change force distribution. Reduce area of member_2 (node_3-node_2) from 4 (3.128) to 2(0.782) because low compressive stress (-1.0). Similarly, member_4 (4 to 3) reduce area from 4 (3.128) to 2 (0.782). member_1 and member_3 remain to maintain stability and load transfer. Ensure no stress exceeds ±30 and total mass < 30.",
  
  "calculation": "Node_4 moved from (2,3) to approx (4.0,3.5) to balance forces. Recalculated lengths and member areas: \n- member_1: length ~2, area 2 (0.782) remains same\n- member_2: length ~ sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 4, area from 4->2 (0.782) reduces mass\n- member_3: (1 to 4.0,3.5), length increased, area 2 (0.782) remains\n- member_4: (4.0,3.5) to (2,0) length ~ about 4.27, area 2 (0.782) reduced from 4\n- member_5: (4.0,3.5) to (6,0), length ~4.03, area increased from 1 (0.195) to 3 (1.759) to reduce stress in tension\nTotal mass reduced still under 30, stress distributed better with max estimated below 18.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify constraints: max stress < 30, mass < 30. Node positions: node_1 (fixed), node_2 (fixed), node_3 (fixed), node_4 moved right and slightly higher. Areas adjusted to reduce mass on low stress members and increased on member_5 tension member. Closed truss ensured with same members. No duplicate nodes or members.",
