Member_1 compressive stress moderate (-6.19). Current areas: member_1,2,3 area=3 (1.759), member_4,5 area=2 (0.782). Node_4 moved mostly vertically. Possible improvements by shifting node_4 slightly (balance shear and bending) and refining member_areas for less critical members to lower area and mass while ensuring stress doesn\'t increase.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Prior iter improved stress by increasing node_4 height from 3.4 to 3.7. Maybe slightly bring node_4 left/up to reduce compression in member_4. Area of member_1 (3) can be decreased if stress allows. Member_3 area can be slightly reduced. Member_2 area maybe small to reduce mass because its stress is low (-1.08).",\n  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 slightly left (reduce length and compression in member_4) and slightly up (balance tension members). Reduce member_1 area from 3 to 2 area (0.782), since stress is -6.19 < allowable -30 and reduce mass. Member_2 area from 3 to 1 (0.195) for mass saving since stress low (-1.08). Member_3 area remains 3 or possibly reduce if stress low. Member_4 area remains 2 because highest compressive stress. Member_5 area keep 2 to keep tension member safe.

Member lengths approx: member_3: ~4.52 to ~4.53, member_4 ~4.15 to ~4.43, member_5 ~3.2 to ~3.3. This small shift should reduce compressive stress in member_4 and keep tension members balanced.
