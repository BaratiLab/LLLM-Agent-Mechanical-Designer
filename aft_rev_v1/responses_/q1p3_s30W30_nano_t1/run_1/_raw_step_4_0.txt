Small vertical shift up or closer to node_3 could reduce compression in member_4. Maintain area 4 in member_1 to avoid stress spike. Maintain or slightly reduce area 3 in member_3 and member_2 to save mass. The truss shape must remain closed with 4 nodes and same connections. Loading and supports are fixed.
