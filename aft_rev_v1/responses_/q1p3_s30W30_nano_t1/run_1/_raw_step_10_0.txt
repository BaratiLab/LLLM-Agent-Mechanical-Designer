Current max stress ~9.18, total mass ~24.09, all members within area options.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The max stress is well below limit, and total mass is comfortably under. The nodal layout keeps supports and loads fixed, node_4 moved slightly to optimize stress distribution. Areas assigned appropriately to balance mass and strength.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Previous iterations varied node_4 positions and areas, driving max stress from unacceptably high values (~68, ~54) down to stable ~9.18 with reasonable mass. No large benefit seen by further movement given plateau reached.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Further nodal displacement risks increasing stresses or mass beyond limits. The structure is symmetric enough with a triangulated arrangement ensuring static determinacy and stiffness. Using high area for heavily stressed member_1 and reduced area for less stressed members optimizes material usage and keeps stress low.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member_4 remains critical stress member (~ -9.18). Attempts to reduce it previously via nodal adjustments or area assignments have converged. Load at node_3 and supports fixed prevent geometry changes there. Additional complexity (adding nodes/members) not allowed. Best trade-off achieved.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Total mass: sum(member length × density factor from area). Max stress within ±9.2 < 30. Mass 24.09 < 30. Rule compliance confirmed. No duplicates or node changes at supports/loads.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Confirm no violation of constraints.
