Its length is short (distance ~ sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-3)^2) = 5), area currently 0.195 (area_id=1). To reduce stress: increase area or reduce force in member. Increasing area raises mass; we have limited margin (2.75 mass left). Adjusting node_4 position can better distribute forces and reduce stress in member_5. Consider moving node_4 horizontally towards node_2 or slightly upwards to change geometry and internal forces. Also, member_2 has low compressive stress (-1), possibly its area (4 = 3.128) can be reduced (slight mass saving). Member_4 also low stress (-2.26), area 4 (3.128) could be trimmed and reallocated.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on shifting node_4 right/up preserving the closed truss geometry, reduce cross-section area of low-stress members, slightly increase area of high stress member_5 if needed but limited by mass budget.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Max stress reduction obtained by geometry optimization: move node_4 closer or above node_2 to reduce tension in member_5. Decreasing areas in low stress members maintains mass budget. Current shape: triangle + internal members to distribute load. Load at node_3 (-10 at -45°) creates tension in member_5; changing node_4 position redistributes internal forces. Maintain member connections to keep closed truss. Areas selected from given set; improve balance by swapping area of member_5 to area \'2\' or \'3\' (to handle tension better).",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Distances: node_4 to node_2: from (2,3) to (6,0) length ~5.

Similarly, member_4 (4 to 3) reduce area from 4 (3.128) to 2 (0.782). member_1 and member_3 remain to maintain stability and load transfer.
