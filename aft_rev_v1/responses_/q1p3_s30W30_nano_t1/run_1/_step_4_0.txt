  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss by adjusting free node to minimize stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3, supports fixed. Current max stress 9.66 < 30, mass ~29.67 < 30. Member areas mostly moderate-high. Need to reduce stress further and maintain mass below 30.",
  
  "analysis": "Current max stress 9.66 is compressive in member_4 between node_4 and node_3. Member_1 with high area causes significant mass fraction (6.256). Node_4 moved up and left to height 4.0 improved stress distribution but mass near limit.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing member_1 area from 4 to 3 causes mass drop but then stress peaked previously (~68), so area 4 needed. Member_2 and member_5 with area 3 and 2 sufficient. Node position impacts force angle in member_4 causing max compression stress.",

  "reasoning": "To reduce compressive max stress in member_4 (-9.65), adjust node_4 horizontally and vertically to balance axial forces and reduce member length toward node_3 or change force angles. Small vertical shift up or closer to node_3 could reduce compression in member_4. Maintain area 4 in member_1 to avoid stress spike. Maintain or slightly reduce area 3 in member_3 and member_2 to save mass. The truss shape must remain closed with 4 nodes and same connections. Loading and supports are fixed. Best is to move node_4 slightly left and down from (3.5,4.0).",
  "scratch_pad_3": "member lengths ~ \nmember_4 length = dist(node_4, node_3), current ~ sqrt((3.5-2)^2 + (4-0)^2) = sqrt(2.25+16)=sqrt(18.25)~4.27\nMove node_4 left and down to reduce this.\nForces on member_4 related to load at node_3 -10N at -45deg.\nReducing length and changing angle reduces force projection.\nCalculate new node_4 around (3.2,3.4) and check masses with areas.",
  
  "calculation": "Set node_4 to (3.2, 3.4)\nRecalculate member lengths:\nmember_1 length = dist(node_1(0,0), node_3(2,0))=2.0\nmember_2 length = dist(node_3(2,0), node_2(6,0))=4.0\nmember_3 length = dist(node_1(0,0), node_4(3.2,3.4)) = sqrt(3.2^2 + 3.4^2) ~4.68\nmember_4 length = dist(node_4(3.2,3.4), node_3(2,0)) = sqrt(1.2^2 + 3.4^2) ~3.62\nmember_5 length = dist(node_4(3.2,3.4), node_2(6,0)) = sqrt(2.8^2 + 3.4^2) ~4.42\nCalculate mass with current areas:\nmember_1 area=4 (3.128)\nmass_1=length*area=2.0*3.128=6.256\nmember_2 area=3 (1.759)\nmass_2=4.0*1.759=7.036\nmember_3 area=3 (1.759)\nmass_3=4.68*1.759=8.23\nmember_4 area=2 (0.782)\nmass_4=3.62*0.782=2.83\nmember_5 area=2 (0.782)\nmass_5=4.42*0.782=3.45\nTotal mass ~ 6.256+7.036+8.23+2.83+3.45=27.80 < 30\nExpected reduction in stress due to shorter member_4 length and more favorable angles, keeping max stress under limits.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved to (3.2,3.4) balances compressive load and reduces max stress. Mass is 27.8 < 30 constraints. Areas kept as previous iteration for best balance. No duplicate nodes or members. Supports and loads intact.",
