Currently colinear nodes lead to a mechanism (no rigidity). A closed truss requires at least a triangle. To close the truss and increase stiffness without moving nodes, add at least one additional node off the x-axis to form a stable triangle or polygon. The new node placement must keep total mass ≤30 and satisfy stress limits. Use member connections forming triangles including the new node.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 above node_3 at y>0 (example at y=3) to form two triangles: (node_1 - node_3 - node_4) and (node_3 - node_2 - node_4). Connect node_4 to node_3, node_2, and node_1 to close the truss. Select member areas prioritizing lower areas to save mass, increase area where stresses expected high. Load at node_3 introduces compression/tension forces, use simple static equilibrium for member force approximations. Aim for symmetric load paths.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_4 at (2,3) forms two triangles sharing node_3, triangulating the truss and increasing stability.
