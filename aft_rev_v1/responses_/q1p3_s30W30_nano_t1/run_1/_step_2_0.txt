  "preamble": "Optimizing node 4 position and area sizes to reduce max stress and maintain mass under 30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current design has max stress ~15.93 < 30 and total mass ~19.1 < 30, good starting point. Member 1 has highest compressive stress (-15.93), member 3 highest tensile (9.15).",
  "analysis": "Load at node_3 downward left (-10N at -45deg) induces high axial compressive stress in member_1 and tension in member_3. Current node_4 is at (4, 3.5) forming a triangle with nodes 1,3,2. Member areas assigned vary from 2 to 3 to reduce mass. Mass below limit gives room to increase areas in some members if needed. Implicitly member_5 with area '3' carries low stress (1.54) so may be reduced to save mass. Member_1 has high compressive stress, may reduce its area slightly or reposition node_4 to reduce its load.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try lowering node_4 y-coordinate to reduce compressive stress in member_1 by changing force distribution, reshape triangular geometry. Adjust member areas to reduce max stress, e.g. increase area on stressed members, reduce on low stress. Check if node_3 can be slightly shifted within load/support constraints (not allowed).",
  "reasoning": "Since load and supports fixed, optimizing node_4 location can redistribute forces. Lowering y of node_4 reduces moment arm Y, reducing stress in member_1 and 4. Maintain closed truss with same members. Try node_4 y ~2.7-3.0. Areas: keep member_1 at '2' or '1' to reduce mass, increase member_3 to '3' to reduce tensile stress, reduce member_5 area from '3' to '2' to save mass. Check total mass and stress balance.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculations: e.g. L_14 = distance(node_1,node_4), L_43 = distance(node_4,node_3), L_42=distance(node_4,node_2). Adjust node_4 y to reduce compressive stress from member_1. Use areas from given set. Validate max stress within ±30, total mass <30.",
  "calculation": "Set node_4=(4.0,3.0). Recalculate lengths: L_14=√((4-0)^2+(3-0)^2)≈5.0, L_43=√((4-2)^2+(3-0)^2)=√(4+9)=3.605, L_42=√((6-4)^2+(0-3)^2)=√(4+9)=3.605. Assign member_1 area '1' (0.195) to reduce area and mass but reallocate stress. Member_3 area '3' (1.759) to reduce tensile stress. Member_5 area '2' (0.782) reduced to save mass. Members 2 and 4 keep area '2' (0.782). Approximate lengths for members 1,2,3,4,5: m1=5.0, m2=4.0 (fixed), m3=5.0, m4=3.605, m5=3.605. Mass ≈ Σ length*area. Estimated mass = 5*0.195 + 4*0.782 + 5*1.759 + 3.605*0.782 + 3.605*0.782 = 0.975 + 3.128 + 8.795 + 2.82 + 2.82 ≈18.54 good margin below 30. Stress should reduce due to increased area on tensile member and decreased compressive member area compensated by node move lowering stress.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node 4 lowered to 3.0 y reduces moment arm, member_1 area reduced to 1 saves mass. Increased area on member_3 reduces tensile stress. Member 5 area reduced to save weight and max stress stays below 30. Nodes 1,2,3 fixed as per restraints. Configuration retains closed truss. These changes likely reduce max stress further to ~12-14 with mass ~18.5. Continue optimization until no further stress decrease is feasible; for now, stop=False.",
