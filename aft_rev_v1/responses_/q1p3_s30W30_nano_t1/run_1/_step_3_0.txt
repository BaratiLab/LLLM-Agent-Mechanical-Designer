  "preamble": "Redesign 2D truss to meet ±30 max stress and mass ≤ 30 constraints under given load/support.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 downward-left; supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller. Current max stress 68.5 > 30 and total mass 17.95 < 30. Goal: reduce max stress by improving geometry and sizing; mass budget allows moderate sizing choices.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design overstressed in member_1 (node_1-node_3) with compressive stress -68.5, area=1 too small for force. Other members under limits. Geometry places node_4 at (4,3) causing uneven load paths. The short members have low areas, causing high stress. Optimizing area distribution and node_4 position may balance force flow, reduce compression in member_1.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing area on critical members or repositioning nodes can reduce stress. Member_1 length=2, small area=1 leads to high stress. Load induces tension/compression; redesign node_4 closer to node_3 to reduce lever arm. Possibly raise node_4 higher for better truss triangulation and redistribute forces. Consider increasing area of member_1 and selection of efficient area IDs from material options.",
  
  "proposal": "Reposition node_4 at (3.5, 4.0) for better load path. Use areas: member_1=4 (3.128), member_2=3 (1.759), member_3=3 (1.759), member_4=2 (0.782), member_5=2 (0.782). Members reconnected same as previous. This reduces stress in member_1 by larger area and improved geometry, keeps mass under 30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Increasing area of highly stressed member_1 from 1 to 4 (3.128) reduces stress approx. 3x. Node_4 higher and slightly left balances vertical load from node_3, lowering stress on member_1. Slightly smaller areas on less critical members reduce mass. Member_2 and member_5 maintain stretch/compression capacity. Member length and mass checked to keep total mass < 30. Keep load and support nodes fixed.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: m1=distance(node_1-node_3)=2m, m2=dist(node_3-node_2)=4m, m3=dist(node_1-node_4)=~5.31m, m4=dist(node_4-node_3)=~1.80m, m5=dist(node_4-node_2)=~2.5m. Calculate mass = sum(length * area). With chosen areas, total mass ≈ 2*3.128 + 4*1.759 + 5.31*1.759 + 1.8*0.782 + 2.5*0.782 ≈ 6.256 + 7.036 + 9.35 + 1.41 + 1.96 = 26.0 (below 30) and stress expectation <30 based on increased area.",
  
  "calculation": "Mass = 2*3.128 + 4*1.759 + 5.31*1.759 + 1.8*0.782 + 2.5*0.782 = ~26 kg. Max stress member_1 halved by area increase. Geometry adjustment reduces load eccentricity and compressive force magnitude on member_1. Other members sized moderate, avoiding excessive mass. Total mass < 30, max stress ≈ ≤ 30.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Final design maintains load/support nodes, adds slight elevation to node_4, upsizes critical member_1, balances others. Expected to meet stress and mass constraints.",
