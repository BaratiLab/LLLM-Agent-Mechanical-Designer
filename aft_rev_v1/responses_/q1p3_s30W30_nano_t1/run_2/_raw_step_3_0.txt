Current max stress reduced to 13.59, mass 22.3 well below limits. Load on node_3; supports pinned node_1 and roller node_2 fixed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has reduced max stress substantially from prior iterations, with node_4 slightly lowered from 3.0 to 2.65 and node_5 shifted outward to 4.3, 3.7. Member areas are chosen mostly small to medium except member_7 and member_3 larger (area 3). Current max stress 13.59 on member_1 in compression, and other stresses well within +/-30 limit. Total mass 22.3 is safe. Load application position and supports cannot be moved. Node_3 and node_5 could be adjusted slightly to relieve member_1 compressive stress. Member connections are all relevant to maintain closed truss. Potential to move node_4 horizontally or vertically to better balance load paths and reduce member_1 stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on adjusting node_4 (2.0, 2.65) to reduce compressive stress on member_1 (\'node_1\' to \'node_3\'). Possibly raise node_4 slightly to increase length and reduce force concentration. Node_5 could be pulled slightly closer to node_2 and node_4 to reduce stresses on members connected to it. Avoid increasing member areas as mass is already significant but under limit.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_1 max compressive stress is high at -13.59, aiming to reduce it further by improving load distribution via nodal relocation. Slightly elevate node_4 from 2.65 towards roughly 2.85 for better geometry to reduce member_1 stress. Move node_5 slightly left and down closer to node_4 and node_2 to reduce high stress on member_5 and member_6. Members with area 3 appear correct but can consider reducing area of member_7 from \'3\' to \'2\' if stress remains low. Keep all member connectivity intact for closure. Relocate node_4 within local constraints (no support/load nodes moved) with precise float positions for optimization. Expect marginal mass impact, stress reduction possible. Recalculate areas only if stress goes below thresholds.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_1 (0,0) and node_2 (6,0) fixed. Node_3 fixed (2,0) load applied. Move node_4 up to y=2.85 (x=2.0). Node_5 move from (4.3,3.7) to approx (4.1,3.5). Member lengths recalculated for new node positions. Stress estimates assume linear relation with length changes. Try reducing member_7 area to \'2\' from \'3\' if stress under limits remain. Verify sum member_length * area <= 30. Member areas currently: 1=0.195, 2=0.782, 3=1.759. Current member_7 area 3 is heavy, slight reduction possible if no stress increase.",\n  \n  "calculation": "New node_dict: node_4 = (2.0, 2.85); node_5 = (4.1, 3.5). Maintain other fixed nodes. Member lengths updated: member_1: node_1 to node_3 (2.0 m), no change. member_3: node_3 to node_4 length increased slightly, reducing force per area, lowering stress. member_5,6 shortened slightly, reducing stress. Area changes: reduce member_7 from \'3\' to \'2\' area 1.759 to 0.782 - will reduce mass by (current length 4.37 * (1.759-0.782) ~ 4.2 mass units), new total mass approx 18.1, well under limit.
