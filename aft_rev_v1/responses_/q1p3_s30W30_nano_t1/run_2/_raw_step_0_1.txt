Load of -10 at 45° on node_3. Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Max stress ±30 and max mass 30. Need closed truss connecting all nodes with added nodes if needed. Areas discrete from given set. First iteration.",\n\n    "analysis": "We have three colinear nodes along the x-axis. To form a closed truss we must add at least one node off the line to create triangular elements. Triangles provide stability and reduce stress. Adding a node above node_3 near (2, y) creates two triangles (node_1, node_3, new_node) and (node_2, node_3, new_node). Supports are at ends of span. Load at node_3 downward at 45°. Members should be sized to keep stress within ±30. Mass is sum of length × area (area from discrete set). Approximate forces in members by static equilibrium, then choose minimal area to keep stress ≤30 without exceeding mass.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Closed truss requires at least one added node off line, preferably between node_1 and node_2 near load node_3. Use simple geometry and equilibrium to estimate member forces. Assume linear elastic, axial members only. Approximate length via distance formula. Stress = force / area (force axial). Use load / area to size areas. Use lower areas where forces are low to minimize mass.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 above node_3 at (2,3) to form triangles (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_2, node_3, node_4). The two triangles share node_3 loaded with a 10N force at -45°. Supports fix displacements at node_1(y,x pinned) and node_2(roller y fixed). Analyze forces: members node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2 (bottom chord), node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4 (vertical diagonal). Reduce stresses by increasing area particularly in diagonals and bottom chord. Select areas from given set ensuring max stress ≤ 30 and total mass ≤30.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Linear axial force transfer, ignoring bending. Load components: Fx = -10*cos45° = -7.07N, Fy = -10*sin45° = -7.07N. Use static equilibrium at node_3 and node_4. Members length via Euclidean distance. Stress = axial force/area ≤ 30.
