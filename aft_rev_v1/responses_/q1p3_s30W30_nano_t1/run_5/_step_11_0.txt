  "preamble": "Optimizing node_4 position to minimize max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 18.08<30 and total mass 23.14<30 meet constraints; aim to reduce max stress further by small node_4 adjustments.",
  "analysis": "Current design uses moderate cross-sectional areas (2 and 3) and node_4 is at (2.25,1.5). Max compressive stress on member_1 (-18.08) still dominates, tensile members have much lower stresses. Load location fixed at node_3. Supports fixed. Adjusting node_4 slightly can balance load paths and reduce peak stress.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Evaluate effect of lowering node_4 slightly to reduce bending effect, or shift node_4 horizontally towards mid-span between node_1 and node_2 to improve force distribution and lower peak stress in member_1.",
  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 slightly towards node_3 horizontal coordinate (2.0) and slightly lower should reduce lever arm of bending force causing high compression in member_1 without increasing mass. Maintain member cross section ids as before since total mass and stress are well below limits. This allows stress lowering without mass penalty.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Try node_4 at (2.1,1.3). Members remain same. Member lengths decrease slightly, mass roughly stable. Expect lower compressive stress on member_1 due to reduced moment arm. Check mass and stresses remain under limits.",
  "calculation": "Node_4 new: x=2.1 (from 2.25), y=1.3 (from 1.5). Calculate lengths: member_1 length sqrt((2-0)^2+(0-0)^2)=2, member_3 length sqrt((2.1-0)^2+(1.3-0)^2)=~2.47. Mass for member_3 minimally reduced due to length and area 3. Total mass: ~23.0-23.1 remain. Stress on member_1 expected to reduce from -18.08 toward -15. Propose no area changes to avoid mass increase. Node and members valid.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "This adjustment likely to reduce max stress while satisfying constraints and mass. Recommend iteration with node_4 = (2.1, 1.3) with same areas and connectivity.",
