Applied load -10 at -45°, causing high tensile/compressive stress on diagonal member.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design results in overstressed member_5 (node_3-node_4) with stress -38, area too small (area_id=1). Other members underutilized or overdesigned. Mass is acceptable but stresses violate constraint. Node_4 placed at (2.6,1.9) causes long diagonal carrying excessive load.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing area of member_5 alone can reduce stress but mass may increase. Alternatively, reposition node_4 to better triangulate, distributing load and reducing stress. Adding an extra node or adjusting connections may improve force paths.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Adjust node_4 to (2.4, 2.1) to shorten diagonal; increase cross-section areas on diagonal members. Use area_id=3 (1.759) or 4 (3.128) on tension-compression members to reduce stress. Maintain existing load/support nodes; no new nodes added to keep design simple.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Shortening diagonal reduces member length, thus stress for same area. Increasing area reduces stress inversely proportionally. Balanced triangulation improves load paths. Keep area small enough for mass <30 but large enough to maintain stress ≤30. Members 1 & 2 carry less load, moderate area suffices. Member 5 critical, increase area to 4. Member 3 & 4 moderate area.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Use formula stress = Force / (Area); increase area lowers stress. With area_id mapping, area_id=4 corresponds to 3.128 cross-sectional area.
