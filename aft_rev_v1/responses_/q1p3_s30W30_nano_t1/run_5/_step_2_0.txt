  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce stress and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 7.67 well below limit 30, total mass 29.35 near max 30. Node_1 and Node_2 fixed by supports, Node_3 fixed by load. Node_4 moved from (2,1.8) to (3,2.2) improved max stress from 36.26 to 7.67 but mass increased from 10.57 to 29.35.",

  "analysis": "The current node_4 position at (3.0, 2.2) results in low max stress but mass is near maximum. The largest member mass contributor is member_3 connecting node_1 and node_4 with area 4 leading to a mass of 11.64. Member areas are relatively large. We aim to reduce mass while maintaining low stress, possibly by adjusting node_4 to reduce member lengths and/or decrease its area.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing node_4's vertical coordinate may shorten members 3 and 4, reducing mass and stress. Decreasing area in members with low stress can reduce mass. Member_3 has positive stress 2.548, member_4 has 5.09, both well within limits; areas might be decreased while keeping stress limits.",

  "reasoning": "Move node_4 slightly towards node_3 horizontally and lower vertically to shorten members connected to node_4. Maintain fixed nodes positions. After repositioning node_4, update area distribution: reduce member_3 area from 4 to 2 or 3, check max stress. Similarly try reducing areas in other low-stress members without raising stresses above limits.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Node positions: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0) fixed. Adjust node_4 from (3,2.2) → (2.6,1.8). Member lengths calculated from new geometry. Area choices from given discrete areas. Target: total mass < 29, max stress < 7.67 or lower.",

  "calculation": "With node_4 at (2.6,1.8):\n- member_3 length ≈ sqrt((2.6-0)^2 + (1.8-0)^2) = 3.15\n- member_4 length ≈ sqrt((6-2.6)^2 + (0-1.8)^2) = 3.78\n- member_5 length ≈ sqrt((2.6-2)^2 + (1.8-0)^2) = 1.81\nReduce member_3 area from 4 to 2 (mass ~3.15*0.782=2.46), half previous mass (11.6), member_4 area kept 2, member_5 area from 3 to 1 (1.81*0.195=0.35). Estimated mass reduces substantially from 29.35 down to near 15-18.\nEstimate stress impact: Lower area in member_3 and 5 raises stress but given current low values, expected max stress still <30.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "New configuration: node_4 at precise (2.6,1.8), member areas adjusted to reduce mass and maintain stresses. Node positions for load/support unchanged. Expected total mass well below 29.35, max stress within limits.",
