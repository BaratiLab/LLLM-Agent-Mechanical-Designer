Node_1 and Node_2 fixed by supports, Node_3 fixed by load. Node_4 moved from (2,1.8) to (3,2.2) improved max stress from 36.26 to 7.67 but mass increased from 10.57 to 29.35.",\n\n  "analysis": "The current node_4 position at (3.0, 2.2) results in low max stress but mass is near maximum. The largest member mass contributor is member_3 connecting node_1 and node_4 with area 4 leading to a mass of 11.64. Member areas are relatively large. We aim to reduce mass while maintaining low stress, possibly by adjusting node_4 to reduce member lengths and/or decrease its area.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing node_4\'s vertical coordinate may shorten members 3 and 4, reducing mass and stress. Decreasing area in members with low stress can reduce mass. Member_3 has positive stress 2.548, member_4 has 5.09, both well within limits; areas might be decreased while keeping stress limits.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Move node_4 slightly towards node_3 horizontally and lower vertically to shorten members connected to node_4. Maintain fixed nodes positions. After repositioning node_4, update area distribution: reduce member_3 area from 4 to 2 or 3, check max stress. Similarly try reducing areas in other low-stress members without raising stresses above limits.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node positions: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0) fixed.
