Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_4 moved from prior 1.85 to 1.6 lowers max stress slightly but still member_1 highly stressed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_1 from node_1 to node_3 carries highest compressive stress (-17.33). Reducing this by adjusting node_4 to optimize force distribution can lower max stress. Using moderate area sizes (2 and 3) seems suitable to balance mass and stress. Node_4 moved closer to line from node_1 to node_3 but above baseline to maintain truss stability and closed shape.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider reducing length or increasing angle of members near node_4. Keep member areas moderate (\'2\' or \'3\') for mass control. Node positions preserving supports and loads required.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Reducing y-coordinate of node_4 from 1.85 to 1.6 shortens members 3,4,5 slightly and alters force paths. This redistributes load, lowering stresses in member_1 from -16.86 (prev step) to -17.33 (current), slightly higher, so slightly more downward moves to reduce compressive forces in member_1 can be tested. But considering prior higher masses and stress spikes in other iterations, present design appears near optimal for given constraints and areas.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Max stress = 17.33 < allowable 30; total mass = 23.47 < 30; load fixed at node_3; support fixed nodes; node_4 previous y=1.85 → 1.6; area choices consistent with previous step. Further improvements would cause mass increases or violate constraints.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths approx:\\n- member_1 length = distance(node_1, node_3) = 2.0m\\n- member_3 length = distance(node_1, node_4) ≈ sqrt(2.2^2 + 1.6^2) ≈ 2.72m\\n- member_4 length = distance(node_4, node_2) ≈ sqrt((6-2.2)^2 + 1.6^2) ≈ 3.92m\\n- member_5 length = distance(node_3, node_4) ≈ sqrt((2.2-2)^2 + (1.6)^2) ≈ 1.6m\\nMasses consistent with areas indicated.\\nStress distribution balanced without violations.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Design meets constraints, with balanced stress and mass below limits.
