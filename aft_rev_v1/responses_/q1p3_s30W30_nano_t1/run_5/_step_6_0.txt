  "preamble": "Optimizing nodal position of free node to reduce stress and mass within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress currently ~15.9 (well below ±30). Mass close to 28.2 (limit 30). Node_3 and node_4 positions fix load/support nodes; only node_4 adjustable. Current design has member_1 with highest compressive stress (-15.9). Loads are at node_3 only. Members use mid to large areas (2-4).",
  
  "analysis": "The biggest compressive stress is on member_1 (node_1 to node_3). Member_5 (diagonal) and members on node_4 are sized larger (area 3,4) producing moderate mass. Since node_4 placement affects stress distribution and mass, slight repositioning can balance force paths and reduce peak stress. Area selections can be fine-tuned to lower mass. Given mass near limit, minimizing stress must not increase mass above 30. Approach: decrease vertical position of node_4 slightly to reduce compressive force in member_1 and distribute load more evenly.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Check member lengths and their influence on mass and stress. Member_1 length is 2.0, compressive stress -15.9. Node_4 at (2.4,2.1) moved slightly down might reduce leverage inducing high stress. Areas could be optimized by lowering some member areas from 3 or 4 to 2 if stress allows. Verify closed truss with 4 nodes and 5 members, no duplicate nodes or connections.",
  
  "reasoning": "Lowering node_4's y-position reduces lever arm for compressive load path in member_1, potentially reducing stress. Also, reducing area of member_5 from 4 to 3 or 2 if possible to lower mass without increasing stress above limits. Member_2 area raised to 3 from 2 helps support load at node_3. We keep supports and load nodes fixed. Precision maintained for node positions. Check that decreasing node_4 y does not increase max stress or mass beyond limits.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_4 (2.4, 2.1), decrease y to around 1.8-1.9. Retain x ~2.4 to not shift load distribution laterally. Member areas: keep member_1 area 2, member_2 area 3, try member_3 and member_4 area 3, and member_5 area 3 to reduce mass.",
  
  "calculation": "Using approx lengths: member_1 length ~2.0, member_2 length ~ (6-2) =4.0, member_3 length ~ sqrt(2.4²+2.1²)~3.19, member_4 length ~ sqrt((6-2.4)² + 2.1²)~4.08, member_5 diagonal ~ sqrt((2.4-2)²+(2.1-0)²)~2.11. Estimated mass = sum(length * area) approx 2*0.782 + 4*1.759 + 3.19*1.759 + 4.08*1.759 + 2.11*1.759 ≈ 1.564 + 7.036 + 5.6 + 7.17 + 3.71 = ~25.1 < 30 mass. Expected max stress reduced by lowering y-coordinate of node_4 approx 1.85. This redraws load flow, reduces member_1 compressive stress without exceeding tensile/compressive limit ±30.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "By slightly lowering free node_4 and optimizing member_5 area down to 3, we keep stresses safely below limits and reduce mass margin for further fine-tuning if needed. No change to load/support nodes or member connections. Precision coordinates provided as floats.",
