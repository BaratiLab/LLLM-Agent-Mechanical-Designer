  "preamble": "Optimize node 4 position within constraints to reduce member_1 stress.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 19.41 < 30 and mass 22.3 < 30 are acceptable. Loads and supports fixed at nodes 3,1,2. Only node_4 movable. Current high stress on member_1 (-19.4).",
  "analysis": "Member_1 has largest compressive stress (-19.4), close to negative bound but still safe. Member_3 tension also moderate (5.33). Mass is well below max 30. Heights of node_4 decreased from prior 1.35 to 1.25 m lowered stress slightly but increased member_1 stress. Position and member areas fixed except minor tuning possible via node movements. Stresses on other members moderate. Optimization can improve stress distribution by raising node_4 position slightly to reduce compressive stress in member_1 and limit tension in member_3.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider small incremental upward adjustment of node_4's y coordinate, keeping x near 2.15, to better resolve force path. Maybe increase node_4 y from 1.25 to ~1.35-1.4. Member cross-section areas mostly at 2 and 3. Possibly consider downgrading member_5 area from 3 to 2 to reduce mass if stress permits. But main focus: node_4 position only.",
  "reasoning": "Higher node_4 elevates member_1 angle and reduces compressive load by changing geometry and force distribution; potentially reduces max compressive stress. Must ensure mass stays under 30. Current areas meet stress limits with margin. Avoid lowering node_4 further; it increased member_1 stress. Keep node_4 x stable as load/support nodes fixed. Fine tune in y direction by ~+0.1 m to reduce member_1 stress. Member areas remain same as in current design for ensured constraints. Closed truss shape preserved. This should reduce max stress while maintaining mass.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_4: (2.15, 1.25)\nTry node_4: (2.15, 1.35) to raise by 0.1 m\nMember lengths change slightly, affecting mass.\nMass estimation:\nmember_1 length ~ sqrt((2.15-0)^2+1.35^2)=~2.54 m\narea id 2 => 0.782\nmass ~ length * area factor * material density constant (given mass summations match)\nApprox mass change negligible, still <30.\nStress expected to reduce in member_1 by better force alignment and angle.\nCheck rest remain within -30 to +30 stress limits.\nUse existing member area mapping from iteration_14. Continue same member connections.",
  "calculation": "Shift node_4 from y=1.25 to y=1.35, keep x=2.15. Member lengths update accordingly. No area changes for members: member_1=2, member_2=3, member_3=3, member_4=3, member_5=3. Estimated max compressive stress on member_1 expected to drop below 19.4, possibly ~17-18. Total mass roughly constant around 22.3. No constraints violated.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved upward 0.1 m to potentially reduce max compressive stress in member_1, maintaining closed truss with fixed load/support nodes and existing member areas. Mass and stress remain well within limits. Next iteration should verify updated stress. Optimization not stopped yet; room for 1-2 more iterations possibly.",
