Load on node_3; supports on node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller).",\n  "analysis": "All members use moderate to high area sections; no member stresses near limits. Node positions fixed at supports and load; node_4 moved over iterations to optimize stress. Minimal stress marginal improvements over iterations.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Area sizes chosen roughly proportional to member forces, reducing overstressed members. Increasing node_4 height beyond current does not reduce stress or mass. Mass is moderate, well below limit.",\n  "reasoning": "Further node movement limited by fixed supports/load nodes. Current node_4 position optimized empirically in previous steps. Modifying areas further would increase mass or stress. Closed truss with 5 members formed correctly.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member areas: member_1 area \'2\' (0.782), member_2,3,4,5 area \'3\' (1.759). Total mass 22.63 within limit.

Structural performance satisfactory.",\n  "calculation": "Stress margins ample; reducing areas or moving node_4 lower increases stress beyond limit or mass.
