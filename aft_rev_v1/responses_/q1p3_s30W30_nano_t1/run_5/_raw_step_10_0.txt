Objective is to minimize stress further, keeping node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Stress is dominated by member_1 with compressive stress close to -18, area=2. Other members have significantly lower stresses. The main load is applied at node_3 (-10 magnitude at -45 degrees), causing high compression on member_1. Node_4 position (2.3,1.55) was tweaked recently. We can try subtle movements around node_4 to reduce stress concentration on member_1 and better distribute stresses.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing vertical height or slightly shifting node_4 horizontally may reduce force on member_1 by altering load paths. Keeping areas mostly same but potentially lowering area for lower stress members can save mass, but we have margin in mass. Focus is on node_4 repositioning.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_1 connects node_1(0,0) to node_3(2,0) horizontal axis; high compression likely due to load transfer. Node_4 influences force distribution via members 3,4,5. Moving node_4 slightly lower and closer toward center might help reduce compression in member_1, slightly increasing shear in diagonals to balance load better. Areas at 2 or 3 seem optimal overall, no need to increase due to mass constraints. ",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Try node_4 positions x in [2.2, 2.4], y in [1.4,1.6]. Test (2.25,1.5). Calculate approximate member lengths and infer stress trends: lowering node_4 reduces vertical force in members 3,4; shifting right slightly redistributes force. Maintain closed truss connectivity.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Shift node_4 from (2.3,1.55) to (2.25,1.5). Member lengths update: \\nmember_3 (node_1-node_4): sqrt(2.25²+1.5²)=~2.7m\\nmember_4 (node_4-node_2): sqrt((6-2.25)²+1.5²)=~3.95m\\nmember_5 (node_3-node_4): sqrt((2.25-2)²+1.5²)=~1.5m\\nSlightly shorter members 3 and 5 reduce internal forces, potentially reducing max compression in member_1. Keep areas same for members 1,2,3,4,5 as 2,3,3,3,3. \\nEstimate mass: lengths × area (area factors given) keeping total mass just below previous 23.3. Stress expected to slightly reduce for member_1 below 17.9. \\nConstraints continue satisfied: max stress < ±30, mass < 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no node duplication, no change of load/support nodes, connectivity unchanged.
