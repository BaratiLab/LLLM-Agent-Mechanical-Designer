Node_1 and node_2 fixed by supports, node_3 fixed by load. Node_4 moved from 1.45 to 1.35 y reducing stress slightly.",\n  "analysis": "Member_1 compressive stress is max (18.64), very close to limit but under constraint. Area and mass reasonable. To further reduce max stress, node_4 could be lowered slightly to reduce compression on member_1 by changing geometry and load paths. Member areas fixed currently at \'2\' and \'3\' mostly; could optimize areas to reduce mass or further lower stress but mass constraint not tight. Node_4 movement is only design freedom. Keeping topology fixed as structure closed with 5 members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Lowering y of node_4 from 1.35 towards 1.2-1.3 range could reduce compression on member_1 and redistribute force. Area sets stable, prefer not to increase; smaller areas risk higher stress but given stresses well below limit, can consider slight area reduction on low-stress members (member_2, member_5) to reduce mass slightly if needed.",\n  "reasoning": "Lower node_4 y coordinate by ~0.1 to 1.25 m to relieve compression on member_1, keep x at 2.15 to maintain geometry near current stable form. Keep member areas same as current iteration as they provide good stress margin and mass is within limit. This small adjustment optimizes stress while respecting constraints and instructions. Stop only when no further stress improvement possible.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and forces depend on node positions. Member_1 connects node_1(0,0) to node_3(2,0) with fixed load at node_3, node_4 position influences member_3 and 5 stresses and indirectly member_1 compressive stress. Keeping members connected among same nodes to avoid topology changes. Careful floating of y4 from 1.35 to 1.25.",\n  "calculation": "Node_4 new position: x=2.15 (fixed), y=1.25. Member_dict same as iteration 13. Expect lowering node_4 slightly to reduce max compressive stress on member_1. Reuse area ids as iteration 13: member_1 area_id \'2\', member_2 \'3\', member_3 \'3\', member_4 \'3\', member_5 \'3\'.
