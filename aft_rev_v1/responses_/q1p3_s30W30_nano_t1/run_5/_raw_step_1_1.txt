Repeated member areas at \'2\' likely lead to inefficient use of material. Load direction suggests tension/compression in diagonal needs better support. Node_4 position at (2.0, 1.8) may be suboptimal in force distribution. Some members\' length and areas create stress concentration. Total mass is within limits, but stresses violate max allowed stress ±30.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing stress in member_5 needs either increasing its area or adjusting geometry so axial force reduces. Increasing area too much raises mass; better to revise node_4 position to obtain better force distribution. Possibly add or reposition nodes to form stable triangulation to carry load and reduce stress peaks.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep nodes for supports/load fixed. Move node_4 higher and slightly laterally to optimize force paths. Increase area of diagonal members to reduce stress. Use area_id=4 (3.128) or 5 (4.887) for critical members. Remove member_5 or increase its area as needed. Revised node_4 at (3.0, 2.2) improves triangulation. Members: member_1 (node_1-node_3, area 3), member_2 (node_3-node_2, area 3), member_3 (node_1-node_4, area 4), member_4 (node_4-node_2, area 4), member_5 (node_3-node_4, area 3).",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing area of load bearing members reduces stress, shifting node_4 upward and right redistributes forces and reduces stress in diagonal members. Member_5\'s stress was tensile and large; increasing area reduces stress. Triangular configurations ensure structural stability. Using moderate areas balances mass and stress. Loading at node_3 angled at -45° induces tension in some members, compression in others—node_4 position affects force paths. Avoid large member lengths with small area to keep stress low.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: member_1 ~2.0; member_2 ~4.0; member_3 ~2.6; member_4 ~3.6; member_5 ~1.3; approximate mass = sum(length × area_id).
