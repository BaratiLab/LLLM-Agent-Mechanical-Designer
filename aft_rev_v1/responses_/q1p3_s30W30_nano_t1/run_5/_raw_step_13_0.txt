Node_4 vertical position influences stresses in members connected to it and node_3. Current node_4 y=1.45 yields low stresses but still highest stress in member_1. Slight decrease in height may help reduce tension/compression in member_1 and balance forces in members 3 and 5.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider lowering node_4 y from 1.45 to ~1.35 to reduce member_1 compressive stress while monitoring member_5 and others.
