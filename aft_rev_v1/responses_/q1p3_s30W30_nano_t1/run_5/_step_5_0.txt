  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under single load at node_3 with fixed supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller).",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max stress ±30, max mass ≤ 30; current max stress ~38 exceeds limits despite low mass (~10.64). Applied load -10 at -45°, causing high tensile/compressive stress on diagonal member.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design results in overstressed member_5 (node_3-node_4) with stress -38, area too small (area_id=1). Other members underutilized or overdesigned. Mass is acceptable but stresses violate constraint. Node_4 placed at (2.6,1.9) causes long diagonal carrying excessive load.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing area of member_5 alone can reduce stress but mass may increase. Alternatively, reposition node_4 to better triangulate, distributing load and reducing stress. Adding an extra node or adjusting connections may improve force paths.",
  
  "proposal": "Adjust node_4 to (2.4, 2.1) to shorten diagonal; increase cross-section areas on diagonal members. Use area_id=3 (1.759) or 4 (3.128) on tension-compression members to reduce stress. Maintain existing load/support nodes; no new nodes added to keep design simple.",
  
  "reasoning": "Shortening diagonal reduces member length, thus stress for same area. Increasing area reduces stress inversely proportionally. Balanced triangulation improves load paths. Keep area small enough for mass <30 but large enough to maintain stress ≤30. Members 1 & 2 carry less load, moderate area suffices. Member 5 critical, increase area to 4. Member 3 & 4 moderate area.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Use formula stress = Force / (Area); increase area lowers stress. With area_id mapping, area_id=4 corresponds to 3.128 cross-sectional area. Member length × area used for mass. Check total mass sum <30 and max stress abs ≤30. \n\nCheck each member length:",
  "calculation": "Member lengths:\nmember_1: dist(node_1-node_3) = sqrt((2-0)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 2.0\nmember_2: dist(node_3-node_2) = sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 4.0\nmember_3: dist(node_1-node_4) = sqrt((2.4-0)^2 + (2.1-0)^2) ≈ 3.20\nmember_4: dist(node_4-node_2) = sqrt((6-2.4)^2 + (0-2.1)^2) ≈ 4.43\nmember_5: dist(node_3-node_4) = sqrt((2.4-2)^2 + (2.1-0)^2) ≈ 2.14\n\nAssign areas:\nmember_1: area_id=2 (0.782)\nmass_1=2.0×0.782=1.564\nmember_2: area_id=3 (1.759)\nmass_2=4.0×1.759=7.036\nmember_3: area_id=3 (1.759)\nmass_3=3.20×1.759=5.63\nmember_4: area_id=3 (1.759)\nmass_4=4.43×1.759=7.79\nmember_5: area_id=4 (3.128)\nmass_5=2.14×3.128=6.70\nTotal mass ≈ 1.56+7.04+5.63+7.79+6.7=28.7 < 30 (ok)\n\nEstimate stress reduction proportional to area increase and shorter length: expected max stress <30.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Reposition node_4 to (2.4, 2.1), increase diagonal member area to 4, side diagonals to 3, base members moderate. This balances stresses under ±30 and mass under 30 constraint without adding nodes.",
