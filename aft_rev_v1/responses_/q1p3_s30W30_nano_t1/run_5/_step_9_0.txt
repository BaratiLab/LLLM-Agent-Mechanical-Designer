  "preamble": "Optimizing node_4 position to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress is 17.33 (well below ±30). Total mass 23.47 also well below max 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved several times in history to reduce stress and mass. Now stable at (2.2,1.6).",

  "analysis": "Max stress located at member_1 (-17.33) connected to node_1 and node_3. Looking at geometry, node_4 is slightly high and left, causing moderate stress in diagonal members. With all stresses well below limits, focus is on further stress reduction possibly by adjusting node_4 downward slightly and/or shifting node_4 right to better balance forces.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing height of node_4 tends to increase stress in member_1. Shifting node_4 slightly right may reduce bending and compressive load in member_1. Mass distribution suggests area ids are mostly 2 and 3; potential to decrease some areas if needed, but currently mass is low enough so prioritizing geometry improvement is better.",

  "reasoning": "Given node_1, node_2, and node_3 are fixed due to support and load constraints, only node_4 can be moved. Maintaining closed truss requires these 5 members. Since max stress is at member_1, optimizing node_4 coordinates impacts internal force distribution. The diagonal member_5 (node_3 to node_4) and vertical members to node_4 transfer loads, adjusting node_4 coordinates affects compressive/tensile response. Slightly lowering node_4 and moving it marginally right may reduce compressive stress in member_1 and balance tension in member_5.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_4: (2.2, 1.6)\nTry: node_4_x = 2.3 (move right by 0.1)\nnode_4_y = 1.55 (down by 0.05)\nAssess effect:\n- Member_1 length increases slightly (increasing lever arm to reduce compression?)\n- Member_5 length changes, potentially distributing stress more evenly.\n\nArea selection remains same with member_1 area=2, member_2=3, member_3=3, member_4=3, member_5=3 as these kept stresses and mass balanced.\n\nEstimate updated lengths:\nmember_1 length = sqrt((2.0-0.0)^2 + (0.0-0.0)^2)=2.0 (unchanged)\nmember_5 length = sqrt((2.0-2.3)^2 + (0.0-1.55)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.09+2.4025)=sqrt(2.4925)=1.578\n(currently ~1.6)\nThis small move should slightly adjust forces reducing max stress.",

  "calculation": "Total mass approximated stable ~23.47\nMax stress expected to reduce from 17.33 toward ~15-16 range by geometry adjustment.\nKeeping same cross sectional area IDs avoids mass increase.\nConstraints will hold.\n",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Apply node_4 move to (2.3,1.55) with same member connectivity and areas.\nExpect max stress drops and no constraint violation.\nStop condition not met because max stress can still be lowered.\nContinue optimizing in next iterations if needed.",
