Loads and supports fixed at nodes 3,1,2. Only node_4 movable. Current high stress on member_1 (-19.4).",\n  "analysis": "Member_1 has largest compressive stress (-19.4), close to negative bound but still safe. Member_3 tension also moderate (5.33). Mass is well below max 30. Heights of node_4 decreased from prior 1.35 to 1.25 m lowered stress slightly but increased member_1 stress. Position and member areas fixed except minor tuning possible via node movements. Stresses on other members moderate. Optimization can improve stress distribution by raising node_4 position slightly to reduce compressive stress in member_1 and limit tension in member_3.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider small incremental upward adjustment of node_4\'s y coordinate, keeping x near 2.15, to better resolve force path. Maybe increase node_4 y from 1.25 to ~1.35-1.4. Member cross-section areas mostly at 2 and 3. Possibly consider downgrading member_5 area from 3 to 2 to reduce mass if stress permits. But main focus: node_4 position only.",\n  "reasoning": "Higher node_4 elevates member_1 angle and reduces compressive load by changing geometry and force distribution; potentially reduces max compressive stress. Must ensure mass stays under 30. Current areas meet stress limits with margin. Avoid lowering node_4 further; it increased member_1 stress. Keep node_4 x stable as load/support nodes fixed. Fine tune in y direction by ~+0.1 m to reduce member_1 stress. Member areas remain same as in current design for ensured constraints. Closed truss shape preserved. This should reduce max stress while maintaining mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_4: (2.15, 1.25)\\nTry node_4: (2.15, 1.35) to raise by 0.1 m\\nMember lengths change slightly, affecting mass.\\nMass estimation:\\nmember_1 length ~ sqrt((2.15-0)^2+1.35^2)=~2.54 m\\narea id 2 => 0.782\\nmass ~ length * area factor * material density constant (given mass summations match)\\nApprox mass change negligible, still <30.\\nStress expected to reduce in member_1 by better force alignment and angle.\\nCheck rest remain within -30 to +30 stress limits.\\nUse existing member area mapping from iteration_14.

No area changes for members: member_1=2, member_2=3, member_3=3, member_4=3, member_5=3. Estimated max compressive stress on member_1 expected to drop below 19.4, possibly ~17-18.
