  "preamble": "Current 4-node truss satisfies constraints; stress is minimized given load/support.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max stress ±30 and total mass <=30 met. Max stress ~18.64 below limit. Mass ~22.63 below 30. Load on node_3; supports on node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller).",
  "analysis": "All members use moderate to high area sections; no member stresses near limits. Node positions fixed at supports and load; node_4 moved over iterations to optimize stress. Minimal stress marginal improvements over iterations.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Area sizes chosen roughly proportional to member forces, reducing overstressed members. Increasing node_4 height beyond current does not reduce stress or mass. Mass is moderate, well below limit.",
  "reasoning": "Further node movement limited by fixed supports/load nodes. Current node_4 position optimized empirically in previous steps. Modifying areas further would increase mass or stress. Closed truss with 5 members formed correctly.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member areas: member_1 area '2' (0.782), member_2,3,4,5 area '3' (1.759). Total mass 22.63 within limit. Max compressive stress member_1: -18.64 within limit ±30. Tensile stresses smaller. Structural performance satisfactory.",
  "calculation": "Stress margins ample; reducing areas or moving node_4 lower increases stress beyond limit or mass. Raising node_4 higher crosses mass limit or does not reduce max stress. Current solution optimal within constraints and given parameters.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "No duplication in nodes/members. All nodal constraints respected. Closed 2D truss structure with required connectivity maintained. Areas selected optimal for mass-stress trade-off.",
