  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress is 16.86, well below Â±30, and total mass 24.38 under 30. Node_4 is only free node. Members use areas between 0.782 and 1.759, suggesting intermediate sizing.",
  "analysis": "Max stress located in member_1 (-16.86). This member is connected between node_1 (fixed) and node_3 (fixed). We cannot move these nodes. To reduce stress in member_1, we can try repositioning node_4 to better distribute loads and decrease stress concentration. Current node_4 at (2.4, 1.85) is near node_3 (2.0,0) and node_2 (6.0,0). Slightly lowering node_4 or shifting it horizontally might reduce tension in member_1 and balance stress.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_5 has moderate compressive stress (-4.11), members 2,3,4 lower tension. Adjusting node_4 lowers member_1 length or modifies angles, possibly reducing max stress. Mass likely to decrease as tension reduces and we can revisit area sizing if needed after node movement.",
  "reasoning": "Node_4 controls geometry of upper triangle. Lowering node_4 slightly (e.g., y=1.6) may decrease stress in member_1 and member_5. Moving node_4 closer horizontally to node_3 (reduce x slightly from 2.4 to 2.2) could reduce lever arm and bending effect, balancing stresses better. Areas remain same or can be slightly adjusted, but initial focus on node location optimization.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and angles approximate: member_1 length ~2.0, member_5 length ~distance node_3(2,0) to node_4. Area codes from 0 to 10 for given sizes, currently member_1 area_id '2' (0.782), member_5 area_id '3' (1.759). Reduce angles or length to reduce stress, keep mass <30. Check effects on member_1 stress mainly, then members 3,4.",
  "calculation": "Adjust node_4 to (2.2,1.6). This reduces height and horizontal distance, shortening member_5 and member_3 lengths slightly. Member_1 remains same length but changes force vector angle, reducing axial load magnitude. Member areas remain as iteration_6. Estimated mass reduces slightly, stress in member_1 expected to drop to ~14-15 from current 16.86. Total mass likely ~23-24, within constraint.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New design: node_4 moved to (2.2,1.6), others fixed per load/support constraints. Member connections as given with area assignments preserved. Expected improvements in max stress, mass well within limit. No new members or nodes added, no duplicates. Refinement possible but step improvement justified. Continue optimization.",
