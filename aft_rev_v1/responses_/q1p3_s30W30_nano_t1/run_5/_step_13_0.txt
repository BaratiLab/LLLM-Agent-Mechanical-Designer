  "preamble": "Refine node_4 position to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress is 17.98 < 30; mass is 22.96 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved previously to 2.15,1.45. Area IDs chosen mostly 2 or 3. Aim to reduce member_1 (max stress compressive) by adjusting node_4 y-position.",
  
  "analysis": "Stress concentrated mostly on member_1 (-17.98) likely due to direct load-paths and geometry causing bending effects. Node_4 vertical position influences stresses in members connected to it and node_3. Current node_4 y=1.45 yields low stresses but still highest stress in member_1. Slight decrease in height may help reduce tension/compression in member_1 and balance forces in members 3 and 5.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider lowering node_4 y from 1.45 to ~1.35 to reduce member_1 compressive stress while monitoring member_5 and others. Maintain existing member areas for mass control.",
  
  "reasoning": "Lowering node_4 reduces leverage arm for bending moment on member_1, thus lowering stress. Avoid too low y-value to prevent increased length/stress in diagonal members. Keep areas stable to keep mass roughly constant. Load/support nodes fixed, no change in node_3 x=2.0, node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0).",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4 y from 1.45 to 1.35, x fixed at 2.15. Members unchanged. Expect slight reduction in max compressive stress from member_1, minimal impact on other members. Mass approx constant ~22.9.",
  
  "calculation": "Node_4: (2.15, 1.35) adjusted from (2.15,1.45). Members same: member_1-5 with areas 2 or 3 as before. Expect member_1 stress drop below 17.98. Mass from member masses combined near 22.9 < 30. Constraints met.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes or members, load/support unchanged, mass and stresses within limits, improvement in max stress. Continue optimization in next iterations if needed.",
