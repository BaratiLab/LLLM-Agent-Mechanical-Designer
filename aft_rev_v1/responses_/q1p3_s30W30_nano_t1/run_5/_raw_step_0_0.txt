Goal: minimally stressed closed structure connecting all 3 nodes.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Three nodes form a line on x-axis at y=0; to make a closed truss, at least one additional node above or below the line is needed to form triangles. Triangles optimize stress distribution and closure. Supports at ends node_1 and node_2 provide reaction forces. Load downward-left at node_3 must be transferred efficiently via truss members.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Adding a 4th node near node_3, elevated on y-axis, will create two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_3, node_2, node_4). This forms a stable closed truss. Area selection can minimize mass while respecting stress constraints.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (2,1.8) (elevated approx. 1.8m above node_3), creating two equilateral-ish triangles. Member connections proposed: (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), (node_1-node_4), (node_4-node_2), (node_3-node_4). Use smaller areas on less stressed members and larger areas on high-force members. Approximate stress using static equilibrium and simple truss method (method of joints). Assume uniform material, axial forces only.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2m, node_3-node_2 = 4m, node_1-node_4 = sqrt(0^2 + 1.8^2 + 2^2) = approx 2.92m, node_4-node_2 = sqrt(4^2 + 1.8^2) = 4.38m, node_3-node_4=1.8m. Select area IDs: larger members with higher stress get ≥3 (1.759), others minimal 1 (0.195). Consider total mass ≤30 (length×area sum).
