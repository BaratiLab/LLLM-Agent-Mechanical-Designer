Node_4 moved upward from 1.75 to 1.9 increased member_5 stress, probably increasing length and tension. Member_3 and member_1 stresses are low and compressive; mass there is moderate and can be optimized. Current member areas: member_1:3 (1.759), member_2:2 (0.782), member_3:5 (4.887), member_4:3 (1.759), member_5:1 (0.195). To reduce max stress, increase area at member_5 and look for a node_4 position decrease in y (lower node_4 slightly) to reduce length and stress in member_5, possibly reduce member_1 area to compensate mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing tensile stress in member_5 by slightly lowering node_4 and increasing area there. Consider to adjust member_1 area from 3->2 or 1 for mass and stress tradeoff. Node_4 around y=1.75 to 1.82 might reduce stress. Member_3 area at 5 looks acceptable, keep or slightly reduce if stress allows.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Member_5 area is too low causing high stress. Increasing from area_id \'1\' (0.195) to possibly \'3\' (1.759) or \'4\' (3.128) to reduce stress in this critical member while relieving node_4 vertical position to shorten member_5 length and reduce tension. We must maintain closed truss and constraints. Moving node_4 down from 1.9 to near 1.75 or slightly higher can help reduce stress. Member_1 mass contribution is large due to area_id 3; lowering this to 2 (0.782) could free mass budget. Member_4 and member_3 areas stable. Member_2 area can stay at 2 (0.782).",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Revised node_4 y approx 1.80; member_5 area from \'1\'(0.195) to \'4\'(3.128); member_1 from 3(1.759) to 2(0.782) to balance mass. Check total mass ~22.5±1 and max stress <30. Load magnitude and direction fixed. Node_1, node_2 fixed.

Lower node_4 y to 1.8 length ≈ sqrt((3.5)^2+1.8^2) = 3.93 similar but area increased to reduce stress. Member_1 length node_1(0,0)-node_3(2,0) =2.0. Area reduction reduces mass from 3.518 to ~1.56. Total mass recalculated approx 22.5. Max stress expected to drop below 20 in member_5 due to area increase.
