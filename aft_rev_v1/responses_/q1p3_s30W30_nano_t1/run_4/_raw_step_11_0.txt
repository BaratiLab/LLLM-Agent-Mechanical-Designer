Areas all same (area_id=\'2\') for all members; stress can minimize by better load path and positioning node_4 to reduce member_1 compressive force. Slight upward & lateral shift of node_4 can reduce bending moment on member_1 and member_4 and reduce stress. Maintain closed truss connectivity with 5 members; area selection can be reassessed but current area \'2\' balances mass and stress well. Avoid increasing areas to reduce stress due to mass constraints. Node_3 and supports fixed; only node_4 can be repositioned. Shape optimization preferred over area increment to reduce stress concentration. Member lengths and angles impact stress distribution and stiffness. Considering slight node_4 movement from (2.7, 1.5) towards higher y and slightly towards node_2 to balance force distribution can reduce stress in member_1 and member_4 compressive and tensile stresses respectively. Verify no member stress extremes or mass limits violated. Current member stresses range -19.89 to +12.41 with mass 11.24, room for improvement. Closed truss shape maintained with 4 nodes and 5 members connecting as given. Overall, strategy: reposition node_4 precisely and retain areas at 2 for minimal total mass and stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on node_4 precise position shift; avoid area upsizing due mass limit; maintain member connections; minimal geometry change can reduce member_1 stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Stress concentrated on member_1 due to load at node_3 and node_4 position. Moving node_4 up and slightly right to 2.85-3.0 x, y 1.6-1.7 should reduce bending on member_1. As node_3 at (2,0), supports at 0,0 and 6,0 fixed, node_4 shift controls force angles in members connected. Keep all areas at \'2\' to maintain mass balance (member mass approx 11.23) and maintain stiffness. Member length and area together affect stress by: stress ~ force / area; force depends on geometry and load. Explicit incremental change in node_4 coordinates consistent with above to minimal stress. No need to add nodes or members; increasing members increases mass and complexity unnecessarily.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths calculated approx by distance formula; adjust node_4 coordinates slightly and recalc length; anticipate stress change proportional to force balance change due to geometry shift; stay within ±30 stress limit; mass from member lengths × area.
