Node_3 load at (-10, -45°), supports fixed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High stress at member_5 (node_2-node_4) suggests load path unbalanced. node_4 moved from 2.5 to 2.0 improved mass and stress, but max stress shifted from member_5 = 20.79 to 24.36. Slightly lowering node_4 from 2.0 may reduce member_5 stress while distributing forces better. Horizontal node positions are fixed for supports and load nodes, only node_4 y can vary.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try lowering node_4 y from 2.0 to ~1.7-1.8 to reduce member_5 stress and balance stresses in member_4 and member_3. Adjust area sizes to reduce mass on low-stress members and increase in highly stressed members but currently chosen areas seem consistent with stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Lower node_4 y reduces tension in member_5, may increase compression in member_4/member_3. Since member_4 and member_3 currently low stress, slightly higher stress acceptable. Area 5 at member_3 is large due to high length and load; area 1 at member_5 smaller, maybe slight increase for member_5 area to 2 or 3 to reduce max stress. To maintain total mass ≤ 30, if member_5 area increased, reduce area of member_4 or member_3. Member_1 and member_2 area 2 seem fine given compression stresses. Member_4 area 3 okay at moderate stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Positions: node_4 y tuned between 1.7-1.8. Areas: member_5 area up to \'2\' (0.782) from \'1\' (0.195) raises mass but may lower stress. Member_3 area \'5\' (4.887) can be slightly reduced to \'4\' (3.128) to compensate mass if stress is within limits.
