Load (-10, -45°) at node_3 is downward-left diagonal force. Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Need a closed truss (all nodes connected in loops) without adding nodes, so must add members connecting these nodes. Area must be chosen from given discrete areas, with total mass ≤30. Stress limit ±30 applies to all members.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The three nodes lie colinearly on the x-axis; a closed triangular truss is not formed without adding a new node out of this line. However, the instructions state no nodes can be moved, but they do not forbid adding supplementary nodes for closure. But since only given nodes are presented, assume closure means connect nodes in a loop using members: node_1-to-node_2, node_2-to-node_3, and node_3-to-node_1. This forms a triangle with zero height (degenerate). To avoid zero height (no area), a new node is necessary off-line. The instructions say do not change existing node positions, but do not prohibit new nodes. To form a stable triangle, add node_4 above x-axis near node_3 (e.g., node_4 at (2.0,1.5)). This makes a rigid triangle with three supports. Nodes and members: node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4; members connecting node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_1, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_2 node_1-node_2. Then check mass and stress. Loads and reactions can be simplified via static analysis assumptions. Use tensile/compressive stress approx from member force = axial force / area, axial force from load distribution, masses from member lengths times area indices. Choose smallest area that keeps stress ≤30 and mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 (2.0,1.5) to make triangle. Member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_4 = 1.5, node_4-node_1 = sqrt(2^2 + 1.5^2) ≈ 2.5, node_4-node_2 = sqrt((6-2)^2 + 1.5^2) = sqrt(16 +2.25)=4.27, node_3-node_2=4.0, node_1-node_2=6.0. Optimize areas for minimum mass and stress constraints with given stress limits ±30 and mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Load at node_3 produces tension/compression in members connected to it. Node_1 is pinned (restrains all motions), node_2 is roller (restrains vertical movement only). The load on node_3 is diagonal downward-left, so force flow attempts to push node_3 towards node_1 and downwards. Members forming a triangular structure distribute load in tension and compression. Choose areas so stresses = force / area ≤ 30, and mass = sum(length_i × area_i) ≤ 30. Prefer smaller areas for less mass, but increase areas for highly stressed members. Use approximate static equilibrium: member force from load resolved along member axis, ignoring bending.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumption: All members carry axial force only.
