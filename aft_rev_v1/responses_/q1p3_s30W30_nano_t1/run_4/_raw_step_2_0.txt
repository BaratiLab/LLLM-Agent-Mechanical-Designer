Load at node_3, supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. Only node_4 movable. Members around node_4 carry varying stresses. Area choices balance stress and mass. Need to reduce mass slightly and max stress by better node_4 position.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_5 (\'node_2\'-\'node_4\') has highest tensile stress (20.8) near limit; member_3 stress is low (-1.48), member_1 and member_4 moderate. Node_4 is 2.5,2.5. Adjust node_4 down while keeping topology same to reduce tension in member_5 and optimize load paths to lower max stress and mass. Avoid increasing area beyond index 5 to control mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Lowering node_4 Y coordinate slightly might shorten long member_3 (currently largest mass contributor) and reduce stress on member_5. Aim node_4 near (2.5, 2.0) to test effect. Check no duplicate members or nodes. Maintain closed truss shape. Keep area same initially to avoid mass increase. Possibly reduce member_3 area if stress low.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Reducing node_4 vertical coordinate shortens members connected to node_4, especially member_3 (which currently dominates mass). This can redistribute stresses reducing peak stress at member_5, permitting reduction in member_5 area if possible to further reduce mass and stress. Keep members and areas stable initially to observe node position effect.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Length member_3 = sqrt((2.5-2)^2 + (2.5-2.5)^2) = 0.5 before, now reduce to ~0.5. Need calculation updated: currently length ~ sqrt((2.5-2)^2 + (2.5-2.5)^2) = 0.5 units? No, actually member_3 connects node_3(2,0) to node_4(2.5,2.5), length = sqrt(0.5^2 + 2.5^2)= ~2.55 - So lowering node_4 Y from 2.5 to 2 reduces length to ~ sqrt(0.5^2 + 2^2) = 2.06 reducing mass ~19% for member_3. Check impact on stress on critical members.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Set node_4 from (2.5,2.5) to (2.5,2.0). Areas remain member_1:2 (0.782), member_2:2 (0.782), member_3:5 (4.887), member_4:3 (1.759), member_5:1 (0.195). Mass of member_3 reduces by ~19% from 12.46 to ~10.1. Total mass reduces by ~2.4 units to ~21.8. Stress expected to reduce on member_5 as shorter member_3 reduces force path. Max stress likely below current 20.8.
