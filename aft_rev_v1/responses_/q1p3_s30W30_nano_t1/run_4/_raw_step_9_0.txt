Nodes for support and load fixed; only node_4 movable. Members have area_id \'2\' (0.782 area).",\n\n  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_1 (-18.46), member_4 (11.18), and member_3 (-9.47). Mass is well below max. Decreasing stress on highly loaded member_1 and member_4 by changing geometry is key. Current node_4 at (2.5,1.6) is relatively low. Increasing node_4 height could help redistribute forces better and reduce compressive stress in member_1 and tensile in member_4. However, prior attempt at node_4 height 2.2 had higher mass (30.74) and all areas at larger sizes, not all area_id 2. Using smaller areas but taller truss might reduce stress without mass spike if we keep areas small. All members have same area now, smaller than previously tested larger areas. ",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider increasing node_4\'s y-coordinate moderately to about 2.0 while keeping all areas at \'2\' to keep mass low. This will alter member lengths and reduce forces in longer horizontal members. Member_4 (node1 to node4) is currently 2-3 area, may handle more load with geometry adjustment rather than area increase. Avoid area increase to stay under mass limit.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Since mass is well below the limit, we have margin to try slight area increase or move node_4 higher to better balance stresses and reduce max stress. Moving node_4 upward increases member_3 length and changes angle, potentially reducing negative stresses. Keep node3 fixed at (2,0) due to loading. Node_4 move only allowed, nodes 1,2,3 fixed at supports and load respectively. Keep areas consistent at \'2\' unless absolutely beneficial to increase a few members. Higher node_4 reduces bending and thus stress. Is the structure stable? It is a simple 4-node truss with all nodes connected. All members connected, no duplicates.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Length(node1-node4) = sqrt((2.5-0)^2 + (y4-0)^2), Length(node2-node4) = sqrt((6-2.5)^2 + (0-y4)^2), Length(node3-node4) = sqrt((2.5-2)^2 + (y4-0)^2). Increasing y4 from 1.6 to near 2.0 increases lengths but can reduce axial stresses by balancing forces better. Member areas keep at \'2\' (0.782). Total mass calculation: sum(member length * area).
