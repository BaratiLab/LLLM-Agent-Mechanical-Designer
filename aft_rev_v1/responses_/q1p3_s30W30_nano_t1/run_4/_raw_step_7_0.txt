Current max stress violates compressive limit (-34.7 > -30) on member_5, mass 11.7 << 30 max. Need stress reduction on member_5 and maintain low mass.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design adds node_5 and members 6,7 but member_5 on node_2-node_4 still overstressed (-34.7). Member_5 area is 1, keeping mass low but stress high. Members 1 and 2 have moderate stress, member_4 moderate tension. The load induces compression on member_5. Current top structure too flexible or load path transfers excessive force on member_5. Need better load path from node_3 to supports with more triangulation or change top geometry.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_5 overstressed: increase cross-section or reduce load share by adding bracing. Top nodes (4,5) too low (1.3, 1.2) limit vertical stiffness. Consider raising top node(s) for better force distribution. Possibly add one new node with higher vertical coordinate. Avoid increasing mass significantly by using optimized cross-section IDs. Also consider introducing diagonal members to share compression load on member_5.",\n\n  "proposal": "Keep support and load nodes fixed. Remove node_5 for simplicity, raise node_4 vertically to ~2.2 for stiffer triangle. Connect node_3 to node_4, and node_4 to nodes 1 & 2. Add diagonal member from node_3 to node_2 for better force path. Use moderate cross-section areas to control stress, especially increase area on critical members under compression/tension (~3 to 4). Remove members 6 and 7.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Raising node_4 increases height of the truss for better axial force distribution. Removing redundant node_5 simplifies load paths and reduces risk of low stressed members. Adding diagonal member_2-3 improves load transfer and reduces compressive stress on member_5 equivalent. Increasing section on main loaded members reduces stress. Limiting to 5 members protects mass limit. Estimated mass below 25. Areas chosen from mid-range to control both mass and stresses while keeping axial stresses balanced and under ±30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Areas: Use area 3 (1.759) or 4 (3.128) for high load members, 2 (0.782) for others.
