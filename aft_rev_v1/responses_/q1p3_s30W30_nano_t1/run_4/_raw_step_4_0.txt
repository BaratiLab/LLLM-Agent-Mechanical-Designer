Objective is to reduce max stress further.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_1 under highest compressive stress. Members between node_3 and node_4 (member_3) and node_2-node_4 (member_5) have lower stresses. Node_4 moved downward (1.75) from prior 2.0 and 2.5 to reduce mass and stress. Area reductions observed (member_3 from 5 to 4, member_5 from 1 to 2). Supports and loads fixed, only node_4 can be refined.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_4 can move vertically between ~1.5 and 2.0. Potential to slightly increase vertical coordinate to redistribute forces, possibly reduce compressive stress on member_1. Area assignments can be adjusted to balance mass and stress.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Increasing node_4 y-coordinate slightly could reduce bending effect on node_3 to node_1 member, reducing its compressive stress. Member areas can be adjusted: increase member_3 area to reduce stress, possibly decrease member_4 or 5 areas to save mass.

Current areas: member_1(2:0.782), member_2(2), member_3(4), member_4(3), member_5(2). Try member_1 from 2 to 3 to reduce compressive stress by increasing area; increase member_3 to 5 or 6 if mass permits; decrease member_5 from 2 to 1 (0.195) as it\'s low stressed.

Member_3 increased area from 3.128 to 4.887 (from 4 to 5 area id) reduces stress similarly. Member_5 reduced from 0.782 to 0.195 area id (2 to 1) reduces mass by ~75%. Node_4 y increased from 1.75 to 1.90 to better equilibrate forces, reduce load path through member_1. Total mass recalculated roughly sums to ~20, under 30. Expected max stress < 15.
