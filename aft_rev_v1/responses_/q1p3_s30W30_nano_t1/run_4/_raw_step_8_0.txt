Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Current design mass 30.74 exceeds max 30. Max stress 7.06 < 30 allowed. Node_4 at (2.5, 2.2). Areas currently high leading to mass excess.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure is light on stress but exceeds mass slightly due to large cross-section areas (area id 3 and 4 mostly). Nodes fixed at node_1,2,3. Node_4 optimally placed but height possibly too high causing longer members and mass excess. No additional nodes except node_4 can be added/moved to reduce weight. Also member areas can be reduced to lower mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Mass excess mainly from members connecting node_4 (longer). Options: reduce node_4 height to shorten members and reduce area ids. Member 2 and 5 with largest mass and moderate low stress can have reduced area. Member_3 currently area 4 can reduce to 3 or 2, member_4 from 3 to 2, and maybe member 5 to 2 to reduce mass.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Lower node_4 from y=2.2 to about y=1.6 for less member length, keep nodes 1,2,3 fixed. Reduce member areas: member_1,2 area 2; member_3,4,5 area 2. Connections the same.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Reducing node_4 height reduces length and member mass. Lowering cross-sectional areas on members still under max stress limits from previous results since stresses were much below 30. This keeps mass under 30 while satisfying strength.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Length(node_1-node_4) ~ sqrt(2.5^2+1.6^2)=2.94; length(node_2-node_4) ~ sqrt((6-2.5)^2 + 1.6^2)=3.73; length(node_3-node_4) ~ sqrt((2.5-2)^2+1.6^2)=~1.61. Areas 2 = 0.782 from table, multiplying lengths and areas: mass~ sum(length*area) < 30 feasible. Stresses previously under 7 allow reducing from areas 3, 4 to 2 safely.",\n  \n  "calculation": "mass approx = member_1: length~2, area 0.782 mass~1.56; member_2 length~4, area 0.782 mass~3.13; member_3 length~1.61 area 0.782 mass~1.26; member_4 length~2.94 area 0.782 ~2.30; member_5 length~3.73 area 0.782 ~2.92; sum ~11.17 << 30.
