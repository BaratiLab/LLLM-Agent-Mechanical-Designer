Node_4 position possibly causes stress concentration. Current design is stable but stress can be further balanced by adjusting node_4.

Shift node_4 slightly upwards and right to reduce compressive load in member_1 and member_3. Keep members area at 2 to control mass; increasing area of highest stress members will increase mass.
