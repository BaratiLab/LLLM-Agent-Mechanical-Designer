  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 y-coordinate to reduce max stress under constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 24.36 < 30, total mass 21.18 < 30. Members near max stress are member_5 (24.36) and member_1 (-16.57). Node_3 load at (-10, -45°), supports fixed.",
  
  "analysis": "High stress at member_5 (node_2-node_4) suggests load path unbalanced. node_4 moved from 2.5 to 2.0 improved mass and stress, but max stress shifted from member_5 = 20.79 to 24.36. Slightly lowering node_4 from 2.0 may reduce member_5 stress while distributing forces better. Horizontal node positions are fixed for supports and load nodes, only node_4 y can vary.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try lowering node_4 y from 2.0 to ~1.7-1.8 to reduce member_5 stress and balance stresses in member_4 and member_3. Adjust area sizes to reduce mass on low-stress members and increase in highly stressed members but currently chosen areas seem consistent with stress.",
  
  "reasoning": "Lower node_4 y reduces tension in member_5, may increase compression in member_4/member_3. Since member_4 and member_3 currently low stress, slightly higher stress acceptable. Area 5 at member_3 is large due to high length and load; area 1 at member_5 smaller, maybe slight increase for member_5 area to 2 or 3 to reduce max stress. To maintain total mass ≤ 30, if member_5 area increased, reduce area of member_4 or member_3. Member_1 and member_2 area 2 seem fine given compression stresses. Member_4 area 3 okay at moderate stress.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Positions: node_4 y tuned between 1.7-1.8. Areas: member_5 area up to '2' (0.782) from '1' (0.195) raises mass but may lower stress. Member_3 area '5' (4.887) can be slightly reduced to '4' (3.128) to compensate mass if stress is within limits. Total length and mass must be computed accordingly to verify total_mass < 30",
  
  "calculation": "Node positions: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0) fixed. Propose node_4 = (2.5,1.75) to reduce max tension at member_5. Change member_5 area from '1' to '2' to reduce stress. Reduce member_3 area from '5' to '4' to offset mass. Member_4 area maintained at '3'. Calculate rough member lengths and masses:\n- member_1 length ~2 (0,0)-(2,0) area 2 -> mass ~2*0.782=1.564\n- member_2 length ~4 (6,0)-(2,0) area 2 -> 4*0.782=3.128\n- member_3 length ~sqrt((2.5-2)^2+(1.75-0)^2)=sqrt(0.25+3.0625)=~1.83 area 4-> ~1.83*3.128=5.72\n- member_4 length ~sqrt((2.5-0)^2+(1.75-0)^2)=~3.06 area 3-> ~3.06*1.759=5.38\n- member_5 length ~sqrt((6-2.5)^2+(0-1.75)^2)=~4.08 area 2-> 4.08*0.782=3.19\nTotal mass approx:1.56+3.13+5.72+5.38+3.19=18.98 <30 stress expected reduced under 24.36 by the larger area on member_5 and node_4 lowered, balancing load path.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 lowered to 1.75 reduces max stress member_5 and total mass safely under 30. Increasing member_5 area decreases its stress. Reducing member_3 area compensates mass. Member_4 and others unchanged for stability. Stops only if next iteration confirms no further reduction. Current proposal to continue optimization.",
