Load/support nodes fixed. Node4 moved from previous 2.7,1.5 to 2.85,1.65. All members area set to 2 (0.782 area).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress is still relatively high on member_1 (-19.45 compressive) and member_3 (-10.17 compressive). Mass is well below allowable max, so slight area increase or geometry refinement could reduce stress. Since load node_3 and support nodes fixed, optimize free node_4 position to better equilibrate forces and reduce max stress. Member areas uniform; potentially uneven area sizing based on stress needed. But current instructions limit only nodal position movements.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Slightly raising node_4 vertically or moving horizontally near node_3 may redistribute forces to reduce max compressive stress in member_1 and 3. Areas kept constant at 2 for uniformity and minimal mass increase risk.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "To minimize max stress while respecting constraints and fixed nodes, vary node_4 position precisely near current (2.85,1.65). Elevating node_4 more might relieve compressive force in member_1 and member_3 by redirecting tension paths. Avoid moving nodes 1,2,3. Trial small incremental moves of node_4 upward and slightly closer to node_3 horizontally. Uniform area 2 maintains mass low. This also assures structure remains closed and stable with 5 members.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "No duplicate nodes or members, geometry maintained. Areas fixed at 2 for all members: area = 0.782 from input lookup. Member length calculated from node positions. Mass computed as sum(length * area) assuming constant density unit. Stress roughly proportional to force/area and affected by geometry. Vary node_4 to reduce max compressive member_1 stress from ~-19.45MPa to lower.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node_4 current position (2.85,1.65). Try increasing y-coordinate by ~0.15 to 1.8 and decrease x slightly towards 2.7 for better load path: new node_4 = (2.7, 1.8). Expect reduced stress by decreasing lever arm in member_1 compression and shortening member_3 compressed length. Mass expected slightly less than 12 due to geometry change, well below 30 limit.
