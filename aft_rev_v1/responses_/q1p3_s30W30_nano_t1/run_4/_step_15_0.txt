  "preamble": "Optimizing node_4 position to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress ~18.3 < 30, mass ~11.6 < 30. Members all with area '2' (0.782) except supports/load nodes fixed; aim to reduce stress further.",
  "analysis": "Max stress attributed mainly to member_1 with -18.34 compressive and member_4 with 11.08 tensile. Slight repositioning of node_4 y-coordinate while keeping load/support fixed could improve stress distribution and reduce peak stress. No mass increment allowed as current mass is low; maintain area ids.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_4 y was 1.75; try slight decrease to reduce bending moment and compressive stress on member_1. Test y=1.6 or 1.65 range to reduce max stress and maintain mass. Keep node_x fixed at 2.7 to avoid large disturbance.",
  "reasoning": "Node_4 displacement downward reduces tension on member_4 and compression on member_1 by changing force path. Smaller vertical height reduces member_3 length, potentially affecting stress. Avoid increasing member areas as mass is allowable low.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: m1 ~ sqrt((2.0)^2 +0) = 2.0, m4 length ~ sqrt(2.7^2 + y^2).\nStress scales with axial force and inversely area, area constant. Slight y decrease reduces tensile force via geometry. Ensure closed structure by keeping all members and areas same.",
  "calculation": "Set node_4 to (2.7, 1.62), reduce from 1.75 to 1.62: expect small drop in member_1 compressive stress and member_4 tensile stress. Mass should remain ~11.6 (unchanged areas).\nVerify no constraint violation and monotonic reduction of max stress. Approximate max stress drop from 18.3 to ~16-17 plausible.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 reposition to optimize stress, keep members and areas consistent to satisfy mass and constraints. Stop only if max stress approaches a minimum; else continue iterations.",
