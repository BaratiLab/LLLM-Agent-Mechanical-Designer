Supports fixed at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Existing max stress 40.29 > 30. Mass 5.13 < 30. Need stress reduction. Consider stronger members or geometric improvement. Allowed to add/move nodes except load/support nodes.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current design over-stressed on member_5 (node_4-node_1) and member_4 (node_3-node_4). Member sizes too small for stresses. Triangular bracing with node_4 is insufficient. Node_4 placed at (2,1.5) close to node_3 (2,0) causing high stress in short members. Need better geometry to distribute forces and optimize member areas. Considering moving node_4 upward and slightly toward center to balance stresses; increase cross-sectional areas of high stress members; remove redundant or low-stress members to save mass.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try elevating node_4 higher than 2.0, maybe at (2.5, 2.5). Remove member_6 (node_4-node_2) as it carries large stress and adds mass. Use members forming two triangles: (node_1-node_3-node_4) and (node_2-node_3-node_4). Areas assigned from {0:1,1:0.195,...} with emphasis on increasing area for high load carrying members. Keep member lengths short for less mass, but optimize geometry for load path.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add node_4 at (2.5, 2.5). Connect members: node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4. Remove member_1 (node_1-node_2) to avoid redundant long tension member. Assign member areas: node_3-node_4 and node_1-node_4 with larger area (4.887 or 3.128) to reduce stress. Use mid-size area for node_1-node_3 and node_2-node_3 to reduce mass. This will balance forces and reduce max stress below 30.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Removing the long base member reduces redundant load path and high mass. Adding upper node at (2.5,2.5) provides better force distribution and reduces bending moments. Using larger cross-sections on members supporting load paths reduces stress significantly. Avoid overly large areas to keep mass ≤30. Member lengths computed and areas assigned to keep mass low and stress within allowable range.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2, node_2-node_3 = 4, node_3-node_4 ≈ sqrt((2.5-2)^2 + (2.5-0)^2)=~2.51, node_1-node_4 ≈ sqrt((2.5-0)^2 + (2.5-0)^2)=~3.54, node_2-node_4 ≈ sqrt((6-2.5)^2 + (0-2.5)^2)=~4.72. Mass = sum(length * area_id_value). Max stress limited by using higher areas on node_3-node_4 and node_1-node_4 members (area_id=5=>4.887) and moderate for others. Check mass: sum of (length × area_value) <30.",\n\n  "calculation": "Mass: mem_1(node_1-node_3): length=2 × area=0.782=1.564, mem_2(node_2-node_3): length=4 × area=0.782=3.128, mem_3(node_3-node_4): length=2.51 × area=4.887=12.27, mem_4(node_1-node_4): length=3.54 × area=4.887=17.29, mem_5(node_2-node_4): length=4.72 × area=0.195=0.92. Total=1.564+3.128+12.27+17.29+0.92=~35.17 too high. Reduce mem_4 area to 3.128: 3.54×3.128=11.07. Total=1.564+3.128+12.27+11.07+0.92=~28.95 <30. Good.
