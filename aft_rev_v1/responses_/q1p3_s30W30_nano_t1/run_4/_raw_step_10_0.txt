Members use area_id=2, moderate area.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress is 16.58, dominated in member_1 (-16.58) and member_3 (-9.32), compressive. Member_3 is short (node_3 to node_4), member_1 medium length. Stress may be reduced by repositioning node_4 to better distribute forces and possibly adjusting areas. Current member_areas are uniform (all 2), can consider increasing some areas to reduce stress or reposition node_4 for improved geometry and internal force balance. Mass left to ~12, room for slight increase if yields stress reduction.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member lengths: mem1( node_1-node_3): length=2, mem3(node_3-node_4): approx. sqrt((2.5-2)^2 + (2-0)^2)=approx 2.06. These two highly stressed in compression. Potentially lowering compression by reducing node_4 height or shifting horizontally to reduce bending effects and force concentration.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Keep node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0) fixed. Move node_4 to reduce member_1 and member_3 compressive stresses. Lower node_4 height slightly from 2.0 to about 1.5 to reduce length and compressive load in member_3 and member_1. Shift node_4 right slightly (+0.2m) to redistribute load from member_1 to member_5. Maintain closed truss with same members. Keep area_id=2 for all members (balanced mass and strength). This should reduce peak compressive stresses and maintain mass within limits. Member mass impact checked for length changes.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Length member_3 at y=1.5: sqrt((2.7-2)^2 + (1.5-0)^2)= sqrt(0.49 + 2.25)= approx 1.79, shorter than before, reduces axial force. Member_1 unchanged length (node_1 to node_3). Shifting node_4 right reduces moment arm of force at node_3 hence reduces compression in member_1. Mass expected to remain ~12.
