Members all with area \'2\' (0.782) except supports/load nodes fixed; aim to reduce stress further.",\n  "analysis": "Max stress attributed mainly to member_1 with -18.34 compressive and member_4 with 11.08 tensile. Slight repositioning of node_4 y-coordinate while keeping load/support fixed could improve stress distribution and reduce peak stress. No mass increment allowed as current mass is low; maintain area ids.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_4 y was 1.75; try slight decrease to reduce bending moment and compressive stress on member_1. Test y=1.6 or 1.65 range to reduce max stress and maintain mass. Keep node_x fixed at 2.7 to avoid large disturbance.",\n  "reasoning": "Node_4 displacement downward reduces tension on member_4 and compression on member_1 by changing force path. Smaller vertical height reduces member_3 length, potentially affecting stress. Avoid increasing member areas as mass is allowable low.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: m1 ~ sqrt((2.0)^2 +0) = 2.0, m4 length ~ sqrt(2.7^2 + y^2).\\nStress scales with axial force and inversely area, area constant. Slight y decrease reduces tensile force via geometry. Ensure closed structure by keeping all members and areas same.",\n  "calculation": "Set node_4 to (2.7, 1.62), reduce from 1.75 to 1.62: expect small drop in member_1 compressive stress and member_4 tensile stress.
