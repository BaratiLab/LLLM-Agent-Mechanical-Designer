Current at iter 5 mass=31.55 (>30), stress max 17.41 (<30). Loads: -10 at node_3 diagonally down left. Supports at nodes 1(pinned), 2(roller). Node_4 height lowered from 1.9 to 1.8 previously. Member_5 area high (4=3.128) causing mass increase.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Mass exceeds limit mainly due to member_5 large area and length. Stresses are within limits. Members 1 and 2 with area 2 (0.782) seem sufficient. Member_3 large area 5 (4.887) for vertical, member_4 at 3 (1.759). Member_5 area 4 (3.128), quite heavy for longest member (node_2 to node_4). Aim to reduce mass by optimizing areas on longer members and possibly reposition node_4 to reduce member lengths and area requirements.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce member_5 area or reduce length by relocating node_4 closer to node_2 horizontally. Maintain node_4 y above zero for efficient load transfer. Possibly add a new node to form triangular bracing to better spread forces. Use smaller areas where stresses are low. Check if member_3 area 5 can be reduced; stress on it is low (-1.5), so area can be decreased. Member_4 area 3 with moderate stress can also be decreased if geometry supports.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep nodes 1, 2, 3 fixed. Move node_4 to (2.5, 1.3) to reduce height; add node_5 near node_2 for better bracing at (4.0, 1.2). Members: connect node_1-node_3 area 2, node_2-node_3 area 2, node_3-node_4 area 3 (reduce from 5), node_1-node_4 area 2 (reduce from 3), node_2-node_4 area 1 (reduce from 4), add member_2-node_5 area 1, member_5-node_5 area 2. This creates a secondary truss segment to redistribute load and reduce member stress and areas.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "By lowering node_4, reduce member_5 length and load. Adding node_5 near node_2 creates shorter members which help distribute the load from node_4 and node_3 to node_2 and support more evenly, allowing smaller cross sections. Reduced areas on members with low stresses optimize mass. Triangular bracing structure improves stiffness and reduces bending effects, ensuring stress remains under limits. This reduces total mass <30 by trimming oversized members and redistributing force paths.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Mass calculation: lengths approx (node_2 to node_4) ~ sqrt((6-2.5)^2 + (0-1.3)^2)= approx 3.9, reduced from ~4.2; member_5 area reduced from 4 to 1 (3.128 to 0.195); member_3 area from 5 to 3 (4.887 to 1.759); additional members short (~1.5 length) at small area. Recalculate total mass verifies sum <30 with these changes. Stress low on members that are reduced in area, safe margin maintained.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node positions: node_4: (2.5,1.3), node_5: (4.0,1.2).
