  "preamble": "Optimized structure with stress near limit and low mass achieved.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Keep load/support nodes fixed; node_3 and node_4 positions adjustable. Current max stress 29.05 near limit 30. Mass 8.716 well below 30. Stress mainly in member_3 (tensile 29.05).",
  "analysis": "Member_3 connecting node_1 to node_4 has max tensile stress near limit, member_4 also moderately stressed. Increasing areas can reduce stress but increases mass; here, mass margin large. Moving node_4 slightly affects member lengths and stress distribution, but node_3 bearings the load and connect to load node and supports. Distance of node_4 and node_3 controls geometry stiffness and hence member stresses. Current geometry is compact and closed truss.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Considering small relocation of node_4 upwards or laterally increases member_3 length, reduces stress therein by distributing load more evenly. Increasing area of member_3 may reduce stress but no need as stress already <30. Using smallest area for member_3 obs. Member areas currently: member_1 and member_2: '2'=0.782, member_3 and member_4: '1'=0.195, member_5: '2'=0.782. ",
  "reasoning": "Since the max stress is close to but under limit and mass is well under max, tweaking node_4 coordinates can reduce stress slightly for better balance but benefit limited. Area selection for members is already balancing stress vs mass well. Movement of node_3 disallowed. Node_4 posture can shift diagonally up-right to marginally reduce critical tensile stress in member_3. Members connected to node_3 and node_4 distribute stresses; minimal geometry change preferred to maintain symmetry.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current member lengths: member_3 (node_1 to node_4) length=3.0, member_5 (node_3 to node_4) length=3.0. By moving node_4 to (2.2, 3.2), member_3 length increase ≈3.35, member_5 length ≈3.06 which reduces concentrated tensile stress. Area of member_3 remains 0.195 for lowest stress agent. Member cross section remain same for lower mass. Mass recalculates remain below 9. Adjust to avoid duplicate members and maintain closed truss.",
  "calculation": "Area selections: member_1: 0.782, member_2: 0.782, member_3: 0.195, member_4: 0.195, member_5: 0.782. Calculate changes in length and expected stress reduction by slight movement of node_4 from (2.0,3.0) to (2.2,3.2). Estimated length member_3: from 3.0 to 3.35 (11% increase), reducing stress from 29.05 to ~26 max. Mass: stays approximately 8.716 + small area length gain negligible <9. Constraint met.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "No duplicate nodes or members. Node_3 and support nodes fixed. Closed truss maintained. Stress under 30. Mass under 30. Optimization marginal beyond - stopping iteration.",
