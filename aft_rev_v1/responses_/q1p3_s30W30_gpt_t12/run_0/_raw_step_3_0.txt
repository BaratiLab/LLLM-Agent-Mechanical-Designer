Loads and supports fixed. Node_5 moved slightly higher improving stress distribution.",\n  "analysis": "Current layout yields significantly reduced max stress and lower mass than initial designs. Members carry stresses well within Â±30, with no excessive concentration. Node placement variations have led to marginal improvements diminishing returns are noticed.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Attempting further node_5 adjustments unlikely to massively impact stress as member forces relatively balanced. Mass and stress well within limits; reallocation of area may not improve max stress meaningfully.",\n  "reasoning": "To minimize stress, heightening node_5 separated compression/tension members for balance with low area for lightly stressed members. Current design strikes effective compromise between strength and weight. Incremental nodal shifts yield smaller gains at expense of complexity.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress limited by geometry and support placement. Since load/support nodes immutable, fine node_5 position close to 3.0,3.75 optimal. Areas appropriate per member stress magnitude and length; requires large area (3) for joint diagonal (node_3-node_5) carrying compression.",\n  "calculation": "Member stresses confirmed speaking mainly via rough proportional relation to geometry and load path.
