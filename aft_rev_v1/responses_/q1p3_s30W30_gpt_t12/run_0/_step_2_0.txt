  "preamble": "Optimize node_5 position to reduce max stress and maintain constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 11.92 well below ±30; total mass 20.6969 below 30 max. Load on node_3 fixed at (2,0). Support nodes 1 and 2 fixed. Movable node: node_5 at (2.9,4.0).",
  
  "analysis": "The structure shows balanced stresses with sizing. Largest compressive stress is in member_1 (-11.9153). Majority stresses < 12, safety margin present. Moving node_5 vertically or slightly horizontally may improve force distribution and member forces. Member areas mostly small to moderate (1,2,3).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Shifting node_5 slightly closer to node_4 and node_3 can better triangulate, reduce stress amplitude. Decreasing vertical y of node_5 toward 3.75 and x slightly toward 3.0 considered.",
  
  "reasoning": "Node_3 load at (-10,-45°) implies diagonal force. Supporting nodes constrained. Better alignment of node_5 can stabilize geometry, low stress member_1 especially. Member connectivity is good, no changes recommended. Areas adequate.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Reduce node_5 y from 4.0 to 3.75, x from 2.9 to 3.0. This geometrically shortens member_6 and redistributes forces across members 7 and 8, lowering max compressive stress.",
  
  "calculation": "Change node_5 pos to (3.0, 3.75). Compute member lengths and estimate stress: Expected lower max stress around 10-11. Total mass approx same or slightly less with similar areas. Constraints still met.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node positions adjusted for optimal member force balance; no member reconnect or area change done to keep design stable. Supports and load nodes fixed.",
