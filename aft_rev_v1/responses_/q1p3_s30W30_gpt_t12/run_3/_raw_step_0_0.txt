Nodes provided are colinear; adding an internal node above the baseline will allow a closed polygon while reducing member length. Minimal triangle at nodes (0,0), (6,0), (2,h) with h>0. Use node_4 at (2, h) to complete uplift. Truss sides: node_1->node_4, node_2->node_4, node_3-node_4 to close. Load on node_3 suggests vertical support effective via truss. Members chosen to transfer load minimizing induced high stresses. Select areas balancing mass and stress capacity from the area database.

Approximate member length and calculate mass as sum(length * area).",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Select node_4 ≈ (2.0, 3.0).
