  "preamble": "Optimize stress by adjusting node_4 position to reduce peak member stress.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current truss satisfies constraints; max stress 20.15 < 30; total mass 19.82 < 30. Goal is to reduce max stress, currently on member_4 (node_2-node_4) at 20.15. node_1 and node_2 fixed due to supports; load at node_3 fixed. node_4 is free to move.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_4 (node_2 to node_4) has the highest tensile stress 20.145, close to limit. length short (from mass data mass 0.975 with area_id=1 area=0.195, length roughly mass/area=~5.0). Moving node_4 closer horizontally to node_2 reduces member_4 length/stress. Adjust node_4 vertical coordinate to maintain structural stiffness and preserve shape, maintaining or increasing diagonal members force balance (member_5, member_3). Current node_4 at (2.0,3.0). Moving node_4 toward (3.5,2.5) can balance truss better, reduce axial load on member_4 and redistribute to diagonal members.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Key factor to reduce stress in member_4 is reposition node_4. Mass in member_4 is low due to smallest area ('1'). After position modification, shift area assignments to re-balance mass-stress tradeoff. Likely member_4 area can remain same or change if beneficial. Member_5 with high mass and negative stress should keep moderate area to aid force transfer. Overall mass budget allows moderate adjustment.",

  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 closer to node_2 reduces tension in member_4. Slight lowering y-coordinate of node_4 reduces vertical load path too. X_y position around (3.3, 2.3) balances stress reduction and structure shape preserving. Detailing member area assignment to redistribute stresses: keep member_4 area_id=1 (lowest) to minimize weight, increase member_5 from 4 (3.128 area) to 5 (4.887) to improve diagonal compression capacity, optionally keep member_3 and others same or minor tweaks. Stress reduction most effective by node shift and area increase in main compressive diagonal (member_5). Models satisfy constraints with mass under 30 and max stress under ±30.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4 shifted from (2.0,3.0) to (3.3,2.3): distance node_2 to node_4 increases ~ from sqrt((6-2)^2+(0-3)^2)=5 to sqrt((6-3.3)^2+(0-2.3)^2)=~4.04, reducing tension and stresses. Node movement within stability and no overlaps. Update member areas: member_4 area='1' unchanged; member_5 from '4' -> '5' to increase capacity, mass slightly raised but total mass tolerable. Others remain area ids {3,2,2} respectively for members 1,2,3.",
  "calculation": "Mass recalculated approximately. Member lengths: m4 approx 4.04; area 0.195; mass ~0.79 vs prior 0.975. So mass reduction in member_4 aids overall mass. member_5 slightly larger cross section increases mass from approx 9.384 previously by 4.887/3.128 * 9.384 = ~14.67 mass (a rough estimate; may slightly raise total mass but acceptable), bringing total approx to 24 within 30 margin. Stresses distribute better due to node position changed. Max stress expected lower than current 20.15.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Constraints satisfied: max stress < ±30; total mass <30. Nodes at fixed supports and load unchanged. Single node moved node_4 (free to move). Members unique and consistent.",
