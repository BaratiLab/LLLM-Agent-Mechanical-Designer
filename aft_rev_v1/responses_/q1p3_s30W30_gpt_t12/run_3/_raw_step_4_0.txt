Load node_3 fixed, support nodes fixed. Node_4 shifted upwards and right improving stress distribution. Members maintain valid closed trigonal form.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress on member_3 is highest (10.92 tensile), others lower. Mass concentrated mostly in joint-to-node_4 members and member_5. Previous designs had stress closer to 20 and higher mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Further node_4 displacement likely increases member length and mass, possibly negligible stress reduction. Current stresses are well within allowable limits with margin; member cross-sections are balanced to support loads with some safety factor.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member areas 2,3,4 correspond to realistic cross-sectional areas; member lengths from nodal coords already yield mass <=30. Load/support nodes cannot move, node_3 fixed at (2.0,0.0). Node_4 locations from (3.0,2.0) to (3.4,2.25) improved stress; further changes risk overextension or shape instability.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths roughly: [m1] ~2.0, [m2] ~4.0, [m3] ~4.3, [m4] ~3.3, [m5] ~2.7 units.
