  "preamble": "Current 4-node truss meets constraints with low stress.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective to minimize stress <= 30 and mass <=30 with fixed supports and load at node_3.",
  
  "analysis": "Current iteration shows max stress ~10.92 well below limit 30, total mass ~20.8 below max 30. Load node_3 fixed, support nodes fixed. Node_4 shifted upwards and right improving stress distribution. Members maintain valid closed trigonal form.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress on member_3 is highest (10.92 tensile), others lower. Mass concentrated mostly in joint-to-node_4 members and member_5. Previous designs had stress closer to 20 and higher mass.",
  
  "reasoning": "Further node_4 displacement likely increases member length and mass, possibly negligible stress reduction. Current stresses are well within allowable limits with margin; member cross-sections are balanced to support loads with some safety factor.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member areas 2,3,4 correspond to realistic cross-sectional areas; member lengths from nodal coords already yield mass <=30. Load/support nodes cannot move, node_3 fixed at (2.0,0.0). Node_4 locations from (3.0,2.0) to (3.4,2.25) improved stress; further changes risk overextension or shape instability.",
  
  "calculation": "Member lengths roughly: [m1] ~2.0, [m2] ~4.0, [m3] ~4.3, [m4] ~3.3, [m5] ~2.7 units. Mass sums checked below 30. Stress checks on max 10.92 < 30 and min below -8 acceptable. No constraint threatened. Any node shifts tested reduced performance or increased mass.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Validated no duplication or invalid node/member. No better feasible alternative detected given instructions and constraints. Optimization converged on low stress, compliant mass design.",
