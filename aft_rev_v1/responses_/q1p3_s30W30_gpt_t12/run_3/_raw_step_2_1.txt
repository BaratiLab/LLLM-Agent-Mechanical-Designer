Objective: reduce max stress below current 18.64 by adjusting node_4 location and member areas, without exceeding mass and stress limits.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress concentrated on member_4 connecting node_2 to node_4 (18.64); can reduce this by moving node_4 closer to node_2 horizontally or lowering its vertical position, reducing internal force in member_4. Additionally, area assignments currently include area \'1\' on member_4, smallest but stress near limit, possible to redistribute areas to balance stresses. Moving node_4 more vertically down and slightly left will reduce tension/compression forces, aiding stress reduction without increasing mass significantly. Members forming the closed truss are sufficient; no need for additional nodes or members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on node_4_x < 3.3 and node_4_y ~ 1.8-2.1 to reduce length and stress in member_4; adjust member_5 to area 4 or 3 to reduce mass and stress. Areas for members with low stress can be reduced for mass management.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member stresses depend on geometry and member areas. Shifting node_4 closer to node_2 along x-axis (from current 3.3 to ~2.7-3.0) and slightly down y (from 2.3 to ~2.0) reduces force in member_4, which has highest stress. Member lengths and layout maintain close integrity. Assign area 1 to heavily stressed member_4 to minimize mass and keep stress within bounds. Increase area on member_3 and member_5 moderately to control their stresses. Member_1 and 2 areas remain same or slightly reduced if stress low enough. Result should approach lower max stress and keep mass <30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths with new node_4; estimate stress proportionally to internal forces inversely proportional to area; reduce stress by area increase and geometry change; check mass sum from member length × area. Adjust node to balance forces and minimize stress peaks.",\n  \n  "calculation": "New node_4 at (3.0, 2.0): lengths updated. Member_4 length reduces, stress in member_4 expected to reduce from 18.64 toward 15-17 range. Areas selected: member_1: \'3\'=1.759, member_2: \'2\'=0.782, member_3: \'3\'=1.759 (raised slightly), member_4: \'1\'=0.195 (small, stressed member), member_5: \'4\'=3.128 (reduced from \'5\' 4.887). Mass roughly estimated as sum(length×area), remain <30. Stress expected max ~16 <18.64 previous, improved.
