  "preamble": "Optimize nodal placement and areas to minimize max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current structure meets constraints but max compressive stress is 21.79 close to 30 limit. Load at node_3 combined with constraints can allow repositioning node_4 to better balance forces and reduce max stress. Node_1 and node_2 fixed.",
  
  "analysis": "The highest stress member_4 (node_2-node_4) at 21.79 is compressive and stress should be lowered. Adjusting node_4 vertical position and member areas can redistribute stresses. Currently node_4 at (3.0, 2.0) yields total mass 20.6857, below max 30. The main challenge is reducing compressive stress near support without excessively increasing mass or tensile stress. Member areas can be optimized alongside node_4 placement within given discrete areas.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing distance of node_4 to node_2 or sideways move likely reduces stress in member_4. Increasing cross-section on compressive member with area 1 might not fully reduce stress; area 3 or 4 would be better. Balancing node_4 higher may help reduce tensile stress on member_3 and compressive on member_4 by converting force distribution.",

  "reasoning": "Keep node_1 (support pinned) at (0.0,0.0) and node_2 (roller support) at (6.0,0.0). Node_3 fixed by constraints at (2.0,0.0) since loaded. Move node_4 slightly more right and possibly higher, e.g., from (3.0, 2.0) to about (3.4, 2.25) to reduce force on member_4 by lengthening member_5 and shifting force paths. Then select areas to reduce max stress: increase member_4 area from '1' (0.195) to '2' (0.782) or '3' (1.759) to compensate compressive stress. Slightly reduce member_3 area as its stress is lower. Area id selections should keep total mass < 30.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member_4 length ~ sqrt((6-3.4)^2 + (0-2.25)^2) ~ sqrt(2.56+5.06)= sqrt(7.62)=2.76 units. With area 2=0.782 mass ~ 2.16 (less than current 0.7 mass with area 1 but should lower stress). Member_5 length increases, so larger area needed. Keep member_1 area 3 (1.759), member_2 area 2(0.782) to reduce mass. Tentative areas: member_1:3, member_2:2, member_3:2, member_4:2, member_5:4.",
  
  "calculation": "Proposed node_4 move to (3.4, 2.25). Areas updated: member_4 area '2' to increase cross-section and reduce stress. Member_3 and 5 to maintain or slightly adjust. Mass estimate remains below 30, and expected max stress reduced below 21. Note no members exceed 30 stress limit. ",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify final node positions fixed for supports, node_4 repositioned fine. Member connections unchanged maintain closed truss. Estimated stresses lower than previous max 21.79 on member_4 with stronger cross-section. Total mass under 30 constraint. No duplicate nodes/connections. Structure refined for load path balance to minimize stress.",
