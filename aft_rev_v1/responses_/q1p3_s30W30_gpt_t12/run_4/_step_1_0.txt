  "preamble": "Current 2D truss design is feasible with low max stress and mass constraints met.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress is 7.24, well below ±30 limit. Total mass 22.56 < 30 max. Load at node_3, supports node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Movable node is only node_4.",
  "analysis": "Current structure is a trapezoidal shape with a diagonal brace, stress distribution shows member_3 is the highest tensile stress but only 7.245 (well below ±30). Load is downward-left; current geometry distributes forces with no overstressed members. Mass is well within limit. Given load/support constraints, changes in node_4 position will marginally affect stresses. Optimization limited by fixed nodes at loading and supports. No duplicate members. Areas consistent with stress levels.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Moving node_4 along y or slight lateral could reduce member_3 stress further or balance stresses in members 3,4,5. Current cross-section areas reasonable (areas '3', '2', '3'). System stable and statically determinate. Further optimization would yield minimal improvements compared to effort.",
  "reasoning": "Avoid large movement of node_4 to not increase member length and mass significantly. Member stresses evenly distributed except member_3 highest. Compact shape and triangulation suffices for stability and load transfer. Larger cross-section would add mass. Smaller sections risk exceed stress limit. Considering no boundary conditions were violated and mass well below max allowable, current design near optimal.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Length(member_3) ≈ sqrt((2-0)^2 + (3-0)^2) = sqrt(4+9)=3.605. Stress=7.245 < ∓30. Area=0.782 (area '2'). Increasing area reduces stress but adds mass. Lower area risks failure. Decreasing y-node_4 reduces length and stress but may increase stress elsewhere. Very small improvement expected. Mass sum: 3.518+7.036+2.8195+3.91+5.277=22.56 < 30.",
  "calculation": "Using current geometry and member areas, maximum stress within safe limits; total mass moderate. Any changes in node_4 y-coordinate from 3.0 to 2.5 decrease length member_3, but likely redistribute stress leading to new peak stresses nearby. Hence, optimization marginal and not sure worth it.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Confirm constraints (stress < ±30 and mass < 30) satisfied with current layout. Load and supports unchanged, no duplicate nodes or members, areas valid. Current solution near optimal given constraints and design space limitations.",
