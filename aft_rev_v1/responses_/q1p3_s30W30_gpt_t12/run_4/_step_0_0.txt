  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss with given nodes to minimize stress and mass within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Load -10 at 45° down-left on node_3. Supports: pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Constraints: max stress ±30, max mass 30 (area from catalogue). Structure closed, all nodes connected.",
  
  "analysis": "Three colinear nodes initially form a line. To close the structure, add a node creating vertical offset forming a triangle with existing nodes to avoid zero area or purely axial members that can create stress peaks. The load on node_3 will induce tension/compression in members connecting nodes. Optimal is triangle with base nodes_1&2 and elevated node_4 above node_3 for stiffness and distributing stress. Use areas from catalogue ensuring mass ≤ 30 and stresses ≤ ±30.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at x=2.0, y=y4>0 for a triangle. Members: (node_1, node_4), (node_4, node_2), (node_1, node_3), (node_3, node_4), (node_3,node_2) to close. Calculate lengths and areas to optimize stress/mass.",
  
  "reasoning": "Adding one node above node_3 creates triangle for closed truss: it avoids collinearity, increases stiffness. Distribute load into several members lowering stress. Choose areas based on member length and estimated axial force approx by static equilibrium on nodes. Simplify ignoring bending, assume axial forces only. Use sum of forces at node_3 to estimate member forces. Calculate stress = Force / (Area×Assumed unit stress). Use length×area sum for mass. Balance area and force to keep stress ≤ 30 and mass ≤ 30.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: \n- All members axial loading only.\n- Load angles converted into horizontal and vertical components.\n- Use static equilibrium at loaded node_3 and supports.\n- Member lengths computed via Euclidean distance.\n- Areas picked from given discrete catalogue.\n- Stress = axial force / area.\n- Mass = Sum(length * area).\n\nNeed to identify area_id per member, length, forces approx, flex target area managing stress and minimizing mass below max 30.",
  
  "calculation": "Step 1: Place node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) (a moderate vertical offset).\nDistances:\n- node_1 to node_4: sqrt((2-0)^2+(3-0)^2)=sqrt(4+9)=3.6056\n- node_4 to node_2: sqrt((6-2)^2+(0-3)^2)= sqrt(16+9)=5.0\n- node_1 to node_3: 2.0\n- node_3 to node_4: sqrt((2-2)^2+(3-0)^2)=3.0\n- node_3 to node_2: 4.0\n\nAssuming external load (-10, -45°): Fx= -10*cos(45)= -7.07N, Fy= -7.07N at node_3.\nSupport at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller handle reaction forces.\n\nEstimate load path approximation:\n- Members to node_3 (to node_1, node_2, node_4) carry the main load components.\nEstimate axial force magnitudes ~5~10 N max for members near load.\n\nAssign areas:\n- High force members (node_3-node_1, node_3-node_2): area 3 (1.759)\n- Diagonal members node_1-node_4 and node_4-node_2 with moderate length and force: area 2 (0.782)\n- Vertical node_3-node_4 carries significant vertical shear: area 3 (1.759)\n\nCalculate mass:\n=3.6056*0.782 + 5.0*0.782 + 2.0*1.759 + 3.0*1.759 + 4.0*1.759\n=2.82 + 3.91 + 3.52 + 5.28 + 7.04 = 22.57 < 30 (ok)\n\nEstimate stresses:\nMember length / area fine for stress, assumed max force ~10 N, so stress ≈ 10 / area.\nFor area 1.759 => stress = 5.68 (well within 30), for 0.782 => stress = ~12.8 (within 30).\n\nThus safe margins on max stress.\n",
  "scratch_pad_final": "The additions yield a closed triangular structure with reasonable mass and low stress under the given load and boundary supports, meeting constraints. Areas minimize mass but keep stress safe.\nNode 4 placement chosen to provide vertical stiffness loader dispersal. Areas picked logically matching assumed load force magnitudes and lengths.\nNo node position changes for nodes 1-3, closed structure ensured. Members connected closed between all nodes with no duplicates.",
