Reducing stress in member_4 will enhance minimal stress objective. Node_5 may be optimized to reduce member_4 stress. Also area sizing to smaller values for lightly stressed members might reduce mass while allowing stress redistribution and further stress minimization.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_4 connects node_4(2.0,4.0) to node_5(4.3,3.3). Shifting node_5 slightly closer vertically or horizontally may reduce member_4 stress.

Member_3 area \'3\'=1.759 is high, possibly reduce if stress low.",\n  "reasoning": "To minimize maximum member stress, node_5 can be moved to reduce bending and elongation in member_4, possibly by shifting down or left methodically, keeping other nodes fixed due to loads/supports constraints. Re-evaluate area sizes: members with low stress can use smaller cross-section to reduce mass and allow increasing section in severely stressed members.
