  "preamble": "Refine node 5 position and adjust area sizing to reduce peak member_4 stress within limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Currently max stress is high in member_4 (23.48 close to limit 30) and member_3 is -15.2 with member_6 at 6.3. Total mass (20.3) is well below max 30.",
  "analysis": "The structure is within mass and max stress constraints, but member_4 is highly stressed and dominant contributor. Reducing stress in member_4 will enhance minimal stress objective. Node_5 may be optimized to reduce member_4 stress. Also area sizing to smaller values for lightly stressed members might reduce mass while allowing stress redistribution and further stress minimization.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_4 connects node_4(2.0,4.0) to node_5(4.3,3.3). Shifting node_5 slightly closer vertically or horizontally may reduce member_4 stress. Area of member_4 is currently '1'=0.195; consider changing to '0'=1 or '2'=0.782 carefully to balance stress and mass. Member_3 area '3'=1.759 is high, possibly reduce if stress low.",
  "reasoning": "To minimize maximum member stress, node_5 can be moved to reduce bending and elongation in member_4, possibly by shifting down or left methodically, keeping other nodes fixed due to loads/supports constraints. Re-evaluate area sizes: members with low stress can use smaller cross-section to reduce mass and allow increasing section in severely stressed members. Investigate minor node modification effects on member lengths, which influence mass and stress distribution. Aim is smooth stress distribution without exceeding Â±30 limits, preserve closed 2D truss configuration.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Check length calculations and area adaptation as:\nMember length = distance between nodes\nMass_member = length * area_value\nCurrently:\nmember_4 mass low (0.4688), area=0.195\nmember_6 area=0.782 (mass=3.4972), member_5=0.782 (3.128) relatively heavy\nMax stress member_4 positive close to limit 23.48; reduction here crucial\nShifting node_5 from (4.3,3.3) to approximately (4.1,3.0) possibly beneficial\nReduce member_4 area if stress permits, else keep or increase if needed\nPossibility: reduce member_6 and member_5 areas to release mass budget for member_4 or shift node_5 accordingly.",
  "calculation": "Adjust node_5 x from 4.3 to 4.12, y from 3.3 to 3.05\nCalculate new member_4 length:\nOriginal length ~ sqrt((4.3-2)^2+(3.3-4)^2)=~2.4\nNew length ~ sqrt((4.12-2)^2+(3.05-4)^2)=~2.15 (shorter, potentially less member 4 stress)\nArea selection:\nmember_1=3(1.759), member_2=2(0.782), member_3=3(1.759), member_4=1(0.195), member_5=1(0.195) reduce from 2(0.782) to 1, member_6=1 (0.195) reduce from 2 to 1 since member_6 stress modest (6.3)\nRe-estimate mass decrease or balance with length changes.\nExpected decrease in total mass and lower stress in member_4 due to shorter length and reduced area in member_5 and member_6.\nRetain nodes 1,2,3,4 fixed (support/load fixed).",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Final optimization state should lower max stress below current ~23.48, total mass under 20 maintained or slightly lower. Closed 2D truss preserved. No duplicate nodes or members. Positions precise floats.\nAreas adjusted to better utilize mass budget across members, emphasizing minimizing max stress.",
