Constraints: max stress ±30, max mass ≤30, area discrete from given set. Must keep nodes fixed. Single triangle must be closed truss (all connected).",\n  \n  "analysis": "The geometry is almost collinear (nodes along x-axis); to form a closed truss with minimal stress, add a new node above x-axis for bracing to create two triangles (a classic truss with vertical load). Positions of node unchanged. So add node_4 above node_3 to form a triangle with node_1 and node_2 separately or combined, ensuring closed. Truss members will be edges connecting these four nodes. The support condition (pinned at node_1, roller at node_2) restricts reactions. Min stress suggests bracing to avoid high bending/stresses. Mass sum based on length × area, constrain areas choosing from discrete levels.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 roughly at (2.0, 4.0) above node_3 optimally to reduce overall stress due to angled force on node_3. Connect new member node_3-node_4, also node_4-node_1, node_4-node_2. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2 (existing direct base), plus new vertical and diagonals from node_4. Calculate length to estimate mass; assign areas from low to moderate values as iteration 1. Estimate member forces assuming static equilibrium - simplify by resolving forces on members aligned with load, set low area for compression members, higher areas for tensile if needed. Aim mass sum ≤30 from table, impose stress ≤30 by member force/area.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_4 at (2.0, 4.0) enables distributing load from node_3, which experiences oblique load -10N at 45°, to supports via multiple shorter members. Short members reduce member lengths, lowering total mass. Choosing areas: Start from moderate values like area_id:3 (1.759) for main tension members. Compression members/slightly loaded members can use lower area area_id:1 (0.195) or area_id:2 (0.782). Keep mass ≤30 by summing l*area over members. Estimate member forces by statics principle: vertical reaction mainly at pinned node_1; diagonal members share shear and axial forces, approximated by geometry and inverse axial spring analogy. We avoid columns in pure compression mode exceeding ±30 stress limit by redistributing load.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: members axially loaded only, pin joints means no moments. Approximating force in members by resolving equilibrium at loaded nodes. Mass = Σ(length × area_id with factor 1). Use Euclidean length between nodes. Stress estimate = Force/Area where force estimated from static reaction influenced by load vector resolution. Using member area as factor in calculation (approx) mass units consistent. Pinned support allows reaction force along x,y axis; roller support allows single directional reaction.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node positions: node_1(0.0, 0.0), node_2(6.0, 0.0), node_3(2.0, 0.0), new node_4(2.0, 4.0).

Mass = sum of length x area = (2×0.195)+(4×0.195)+(4.472×0.782)+(5.657×0.782)+(4×1.759) = 0.39+0.78+3.5+4.43+7.036=16.136 < 30 satisfied.
