Current max stress at member_5 (-21.6) and member_6 (18.1), well below limit. Mass 16.08 also well under 30.",\n  "analysis": "Current design achieves large margin on stress and mass. Largest compressive stress on member_5 and tensile on member_6 are significant but within allowed. Member_4 is zero stress, representing inefficiency. Node_5 allows distributing force but could be better positioned. Some members use smaller areas. Objective to reduce max stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_5 has high compression magnitude near limit but less than 30. Member_6 with tensile 18 might be reduced via geometry or area. Member_4 zero stress suggests reducing area to lower mass, freeing mass quota to increase other areas for stress reduction.",\n  "reasoning": "Move node_5 slightly to redistribute forces to reduce peak stress on members 5 and 6. Keep node_3 and supports fixed. Member_4 currently with zero stress and area \'2\' can reduce area to \'1\'(0.195) to save mass. Increase areas of members 5 and 6 to reduce stress (currently 1) - raise member_5 from area 1 (0.195) to 2 (0.782) and member_6 from 1 (0.195) to 2 (0.782). Adjust node_5 y-coordinate slightly upwards and x-coordinate slightly right to improve geometry, about +0.1 y and +0.1 x . Ensure no loss of structural closure.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Updating areas: member_4 area 2 to 1 saves mass ~ (1 length × (0.782 - 0.195) coeff). Members 5&6 increase area from 0.195 to 0.782 add mass ~ (length × (0.782-0.195)) each. Overall minimal net mass change but improved strength. Moving node_5 from (4, 3) to (4.1, 3.1) for better force distribution given load on node_3 at (-10, -45 deg).",\n  "calculation": "Node positions: keep node_1 (0.0,0.0), node_2 (6.0,0.0), node_3 (2.0,0.0), node_4 (2.0,4.0); update node_5 = (4.1, 3.1). Members updated with areas: member_1 = 3, member_2 = 2, member_3 = 3, member_4 = 1 (reduce area), member_5 = 2 (increase), member_6 = 2 (increase). Expect reduction in stresses on contentious members by area and improved geometry. Mass stays roughly <16.5, well below 30 max. All member connections valid and no duplicates.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Adjusted areas reduce zero stress member\'s area and strengthen stressed members with minimal mass impact. Nodally moving node_5 balances geometry. This should reduce max stress further safely under 30 with mass within limits while maintaining closed structure.
