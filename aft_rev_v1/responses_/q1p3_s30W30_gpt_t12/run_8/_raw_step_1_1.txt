Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Current max stress 48.35 > allowable 30. Total mass 16.13 < 30 allowed. Need to reduce max stress and maintain total mass within 30.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current design max compressive stress on member_1 (-48.35) exceeds limit. Member_1 area (0.195) too small for high compressive load. Members from node_1 and node_2 to node_4 large areas, contributing major mass but with low stress. Area distribution and geometry can be improved to reduce stresses and mass. Additional node to improve force path to reduce high stress possibility is considered.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce compressive stress in member_1, increase its area or reduce length or redistribute load path by placing an intermediate node to create more triangulation, lowering member forces. Current geometry with 1 intermediate node not sufficient, propagating large compression on member_1.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Propose adding a new node_5 at (4.0, 3.0) to create better triangulated structure. Use members connecting node_1-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_3-node_5, node_3-node_4, and node_1-node_3, node_5-node_3. Reset member areas, increasing members directly under high load to area 3 (1.759) or 4 (3.128) and keeping low stress members smaller.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Adding node_5 provides improved load path and triangulation reducing high compressive forces on member_1. Connecting node_5 to node_2, node_3, and node_4 provide multiple load paths. Areas chosen from catalog to keep max stress ≤30 and minimize mass. Member lengths rebalanced for efficient load transfer. Areas assigned based on expected force from load path and observed FEM stress distribution.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths computed for new geometry; assign areas prioritizing members under high compression/tension. Verify member stresses by approximating load transfer and checking member forces ≈ ≤30 allowable.
