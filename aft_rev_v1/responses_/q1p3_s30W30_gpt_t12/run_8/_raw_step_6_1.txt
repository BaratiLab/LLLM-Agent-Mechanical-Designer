Current max stress = 6.93, total_mass = 25.14, both within constraints. Nodes load/support fixed: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), loads at node_3 (2,0).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure refined from earlier iterations, mass close to but below 30, stresses well below limits providing good safety margin. Trends show added member_6, _7, _8 improved force distribution and stress reduction relative to iteration 4\'s very high stresses. Areas mostly 2 or 3, relatively large, maintain stress low and mass manageable.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further node repositioning might reduce stress marginally but risk minor instability or complexity due to added node_6 connection. Current distribution with 6 nodes and 8 members forms a stable closed truss moving load paths delicately balanced.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Given loads/support constraints and node_3 fixed position, node_4 raised to 4.2 from 4.0, node_5 and 6 positions provide triangulated support for load transfer. Member areas 2 or 3 sufficed to keep stresses low. Further reducing member areas risks stress increase. Moving optimization outside load/support fixed nodes risks structure damage or constraints violation.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Members with max tension/compression: member_6 (-6.93), member_7 (6.35), other stresses lower. All comfortably below Â±30 limit. Total mass 25.14 below 30 maximum. Area choices consistent with strengths so far. Connection topology stable and closed, no duplicates.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Recalculate member forces confirms max stress ~7 < 30. Total member lengths with given area factors produce mass ~25.14 < 30. Nodal adjustments to reduce stresses by small amounts not warranted as current design works well. Conclude near-optimal balance given constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Meets all criteria: low stress, allowable mass, stable geometry, fixed nodes for load/support unchanged.
