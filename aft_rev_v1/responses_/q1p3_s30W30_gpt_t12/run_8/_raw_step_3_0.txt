Node_5 position changed slightly in iteration 2 to reduce stress. Members areas mostly moderate.",\n  "analysis": "Member_4 has highest stress (~12.35), area_id=1 (lowest density). Nodes at load and supports fixed. Minor movement of node_5 to reduce stress concentration and balance load paths is effective. Member masses well distributed with heavier members on main chords. Areas can be kept or slight adjusted. Mass is safe, stress far from limits, so primary objective is further smooth stress distribution and minimal max stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_4 area is minimal, but stress is still highest. Reposition node_5 slightly closer to node_4 and node_2 to elongate member_4 and distribute stresses better. Member_5 and 6 have close moderate stresses; minimal incremental benefit moving them might destabilize overall force balance. Maintain topology with members linking \'node_1\' and \'node_4\', \'node_3\' and \'node_4\', \'node_3\' and \'node_5\', etc., to keep closed polygon and load transfer.",\n  "reasoning": "Nodal position of node_5 can be adjusted slightly outward and upward (increase x and y) to make member_4 less steep, increasing length and reducing stress concentration. Adjust in small increments ensuring no major geometry distortion and no overlap or member crosses. Maintain areas as is or reduce area for members with low stress underutilization to slightly reduce mass but priority is stress reduction here.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Propose move node_5 from (4.1,3.1) to (4.3,3.3). Check impact: Length of member_4 (node_4 to node_5) increases, stress reduces as force can distribute over longer member and slightly adjusted angles improve stress flow. Verify stress in members_2 and 3 to ensure no overload.",\n  "calculation": "Current member_4 length ~ sqrt((4.1-2)^2+(3.1-4)^2)= sqrt(2.1^2+(-0.9)^2)= sqrt(4.41+0.81)= sqrt(5.22)=2.29 units approx. Moving to (4.3,3.3), length becomes sqrt((4.3-2)^2+(3.3-4)^2)= sqrt(2.3^2+(-0.7)^2)= sqrt(5.29+0.49)= sqrt(5.78)=2.41 units ~5% increase length reducing stress by roughly 5%. Mixed effect on connected members but expect lower max stress under capacity., Updating member dict with areas: keep current areas for members. Total mass remains ~19.9, much under 30 limit.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no load or support nodes moved, topology closed, no duplicates, and areas from set used.
