  "preamble": "Optimize truss nodes to reduce max stress while within mass and stress limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 13.31 < 30, mass 19.87 < 30. Nodes allowed to move except supports/loads. Members mostly area 2; some area 1 and 0. Member_7 low stress and mass. Stiffness likely controlled by node_4, node_5 positioning.",
  "analysis": "Max stress safe margin, but improving further desirable for longevity and efficiency. Node_4 and node_5 movable, repositioning to reduce critical compressive stresses on members 1 and 6 (high negative stress ~-13 and -6). Areas are mid-range, optimization by geometric rearrangement reducing tensile/compressive member stresses will help. Reducing member_4 area from 2 to 1 seems effective (lowering its stress). Member 7 almost zero area, negligible effect. Observing history: spacing of node_4 vertically around 2.8-2.9, node_5 near (2.1-2.2, 3.0). Shift node_5 slightly left/down to better distribute force path and reduce stress in members 1 and 6 (hot spots). Slight upward shift to node_4 increases vertical support. member_5 area at 1 reduces mass but keeps stress low.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try increasing node_4 y position slightly (2.85 -> 2.9) and move node_5 closer to node_4 along diagonal line (e.g., (2.12, 2.92)) to maintain stiff triangle. Lowering node_5 x may reduce horizontal components. Set member_4 to area 1 to reduce mass without buckling. Areas mostly as is with attention on compressive members1 and 6 stress balance.",
  "reasoning": "Shifting node_5 slightly closer to node_4 reduces member_6 length, reducing its stress. Also better load path from node_3 to supports. Increasing node_4 y moderately improves stiffness, lowering deflections and stress. Member 4 from area 2 to 1 lowers mass, safely as stress is moderate. Member 7 area remains 0 (1) for stability. Member_8 area elevated to 2 favorable for stress transfer. Changing member areas must keep stresses within 30, so moderate cross sections preferred. This optimized position mix reduces stress concentrations while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Length(member_6) reduces by ~sqrt((2.15-2.12)^2+(3.0-2.92)^2)= approx 0.081. Reduced length x constant area lowers axial load stress. Member 1 compression (-13.31) could reduce by shorter leverage through node_5 shift. Member_4 stress reduction planned by area from 2->1 with small stiffness trade-off at node_4 y=2.9 is reasonable. Mass recalculated with member lengths x areas from ID map. Structure remains statically determinate. ",
  "calculation": "Update node_4 (2.0, 2.9), node_5 (2.12, 2.92). Keep load/support nodes fixed. Members: 1,2,3,6,8,9 area 2; members 4,5 area 1; member 7 area 0 (1). Estimate total mass ~19 but some reduction possible by shortened member_6 and area lowering member_4 mass. Expected max stress < previous 13.31. Verify no duplicate members and closed truss form maintained.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Positions and areas within constraint, slight node moves simplify stress flow, mass effect small but positive. Stop flag False to allow further iterations given room for small stress improvement.",
