Current max stress 13.36, mass 17.64 under limits. Load at node_3, supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 needs node relocations excluding load/support nodes.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design iteration 6 has max stress 13.36, well below limit 30, mass 17.64 less than 30. All member stresses acceptable. Minor positional adjustment of non-support/load nodes can further reduce stresses but improvements likely marginal due to already low max stress. Node_5 position adjustment near node_4 shows limit of improvements. Stress distribution balancing optimal with current topology.",  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Non-support/load nodes to move: node_3 and node_4 and node_5 candidates. Node_3 fixed due to load, nodes 4 & 5 adjustable. Member areas chosen adequately (mostly area 1-2). Already in optimized range.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 or node_5 slightly to reduce compressive stress in member_1 (highest -13.36) possible but risks increasing other stresses or requiring mass increase. Current areas and topology provide balanced stress and low mass. Remember constraint to keep structure closed. Iterative improvements in mass under 20 feasible but tradeoff with stability and stress. Given already satisfying constraints, no substantial improvements expected. Minimal movement will have marginal effect compared to computational effort and complexity. Best to stop optimization here.",  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Max stress 13.36 well within bounds. Member area adjustments could reduce mass but member areas chosen keep stresses low. Overall topology with diagonals symmetric controlling stress. Further nodal moves likely only minor benefit with risk. Stop optimization.",\n\n  "calculation": "Confirmed current max stresses and masses within limits verified from FEM results. Position moves for nodes_4 at y=2.9 and node_5 at about (2.12,2.92) optimal given constraints.
