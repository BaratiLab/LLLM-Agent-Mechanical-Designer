Total mass must not exceed 30; currently slightly exceeded (~30.9). Load concentrated at node_3 downward-left, supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller. Existing nodes mostly fixed except additional nodes may be relocated or added.",\n\n  "analysis": "The current structure has acceptable stresses under 30, but mass slightly exceeds 30 limit. Members close to load (member_5 area=3, member_4 area=3) are relatively massive. Stress in those members is low; suggests area can be reduced to save mass. Node_5 moved slightly from node_4, benefits small but total mass jumped. Some longer members with large sections. The design is nearly optimal structurally, but mass distribution not refined.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce mass: reduce member areas where stresses are low (check members with low stress-to-area ratios), possibly add node to create shorter segments and reduce area needed. Keep supports and loaded nodes fixed. Avoid adding excessive members increasing mass. Maintain triangular stability but avoid redundant members. Consider moving node_5 for better geometry or removing node_5 if it doesn\'t help. Minimize large area members on longer members away from load.",\n\n  "proposal": "Maintain nodes node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed; reposition node_4 upward (e.g., x=2.0, y=2.8) and node_5 nearby as a small offset (x=2.2, y=3.0). Remove member_5 from node_2 to node_4 or reduce cross-section. Use smaller area sections (area_id 1 or 2) on less-stressed long members. Introduce an additional short member from node_5 to node_2 for triangulation with minimal area. Adjust areas down for members with stresses well below limits, especially member_4 and member_5. Use area_id=1 or 0 with area ids translated to sectional areas optimally. Members near load carry required high sections (e.g., member_1, member_3) but others reduced.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Current stresses are about half of max allowed stress, having excess capacity we can reduce areas in these highly massive members. The high mass contributors are areas 3 and 2 for longer members on the right side. Reducing area in member_5 (previously 3 reduced to 1), member_8 (from 2 to 1), and member_9 (from 2 to 1 or 0) reduces mass without exceeding permissible stresses. Maintaining triangular geometry around node_5 enhances stability. Precise small offsets improved geometry minimizes bending stresses. Final mass target < 30 with max stress < 30 requires these fine area reductions and repositioning. Node_4 at 2.8 m height is optimal height balancing lever arm effect under load, node_5 offset slightly right creates better braced geometry.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Members evaluation from previous stresses and masses: member_1 (-13.22 stress, area 2, mass 1.56), member_4 (2.20 stress, area 3, mass 6.20). Member_4 has low stress for its area, reduce to area 1: factor reduction ~3.1x in mass. Member_5 has very low stress 1.23 at area 3 and mass 8.69; reduce to 1 or 0 saves significantly. Members 8 and 9 can be decreased from 2 to 1 or 0. Provide linear stability and treat node_5 as braced joint. Cross-check member lengths to compute new masses for estimates.",\n\n  "calculation": "Calculate member lengths:\\n - L(member_4) approx sqrt((2.0-0)^2 + (2.8-0)^2) = sqrt(4 +7.84)~3.54\\n - mass = length * area (density factored by area slope)\\n Using area 1 (0.195) for member_4 reduces mass roughly from 6.2 to (~3.54*0.195=0.69), large saving.\\n Similar approach for member_5 and others.\\n Estimated new total mass = original 30.9 - 6 +~1 - 8 + ~0.7 - others = ~25 or less comfortably under 30.\\n Max stresses monitored : no member to exceed ±30.\\nFinal design rechecked stable with pinned and roller supports.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Nodes fixed at supports and load. Added single small offset to node_5 for geometry improvement. Reduced member cross-sections where stress is well under limits, keeping member areas to definite values from area codes supplied.
