  "preamble": "Optimize truss by relocating non-load/support nodes to reduce stress and mass within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max stress ±30, mass ≤ 30. Current design max stress 12.92 and mass 25.07. Load at node_3, supports pinned at node_1 그리고 roller at node_2; node_4 and node_5 moveable.",
  
  "analysis": "Current max stress 12.92 well below limit. Mass at 25.07 near but below 30 max. Members with smaller area (1 or 2) carry moderate stresses. Member_4 (node_1-node_4) with area 3 carries low stress (2.45) but large mass (6.34). Adjusting node_4 vertically higher increased mass but lowered stress --> node_5 helps stabilize. Potential to slightly reduce node_4 and node_5 height to reduce mass and rebalance internal force distribution to minimize peak stress further.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Higher verticals help redistribute stress but increase mass. Lowering node_5 and node_4 might reduce mass while keeping stress tolerable. Check if node_5 can be close to node_4 to reduce some longer members like node_1-node_5 and node_2-node_5 lengths.",
  
  "reasoning": "Keep node_1 and node_2 fixed per constraint. Load at node_3 is fixed; only node_4 and node_5 can move. Move node_4 down from y=3.0 to about y=2.6~2.8 and node_5 closer to node_4 but maintain truss closure and adequate geometry. This reduces member lengths of node_4 and node_5 connections to node_1 and node_2, thus reducing mass and stress. Also, minimize area sizes on low-stress members that allow downscale (like members with area=1) to reduce mass.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate new positions for node_4 and node_5 with node_4 at (2.0, 2.7) and node_5 at (2.0, 3.1). Check member lengths: node_3-node_5, node_4-node_5 can shorten slightly. Use areas: maintain same to ensure stress within limits but can reduce member_5 or member_9 areas from 2 to 1 if stressed low enough after position changes.",

  "calculation": "New coordinates node_4 (2.0, 2.7), node_5 (2.0, 3.1). Member lengths decreased moderately: length(node_1-node_5) decreases from 3.5 to 3.1, length(node_2-node_5) decreases similarly. Estimated mass reduction from length decrease, member_stress expected not to increase beyond max 13. Perform areas adjustment: change member_7 area to '1' remains (lowest stress member involved), member_8 area kept at '1'; consider reducing member_5 and member_9 from '2' to '1' to save mass - member_5 stress is 3.827 and member_9 stress 1.09 suitable for lowering area to '1'. Stress margin ample. Final total mass estimate ~22.5 < 30.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node placement changes and areas choices respect instructions, nodes with loads/supports fixed, closed 2D truss preserved with no duplicate members. Estimated stresses, mass well within constraints. Optimization continues to reduce stress margin and total mass.",
