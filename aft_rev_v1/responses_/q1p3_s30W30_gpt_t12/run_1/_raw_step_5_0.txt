Load on node_3, supports fixed nodes. Members with area 2 and 1 mostly; lowest areas causing some high stress.",\n  "analysis": "Member_4 has high tensile stress at 15.68 nearly max stress and carries low cross-section \'1\'. Increasing area wisely can reduce stress while not adding excessive mass. Node_4 lowered to 2.8 causes member geometry shifting. Node_5 moved slightly away (x=2.2) may cause stress increase in member_8 and 9. Member_7 with area \'0\' is very small area, stress near zero, minimal contribution to mass. Relocating node_5 slightly toward x=2.0 may balance forces better; adjusting node_4 upward slightly to 2.85 might reduce stress on member_4 and retain geometry. Reduce/avoid larger area members for mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce member_4 stress, increasing its cross-section from area \'1\' (0.195) to \'2\' (0.782) moderately increases mass but yields stress reduction. Also increasing member_8 and 9’s region could reduce their stress. Keep node_3 x=2.0 for load and support constraints. Small modifications on node_4 and node_5 vertical position can optimize stress flow. Maintaining closed structure needs full connections.",\n  "reasoning": "High tensile stress on member_4 requires increased cross-section; reducing node_4 y-coordinate slightly from 2.8 -> 2.85 affects member lengths and load path smoothing, reducing peak stress. Moving node_5 back closer to node_4 (x=2.1->2.15) reduces stress on members 8 and 9 but maintaining equilibrium necessitates small nodal shifts only. Areas for members 4,8,9 changed to \'2\' to reduce tensile stresses effectively. Members attached to node_3 held at \'2\' area to ensure load transfer capability. Member_7 kept minimal to save mass while slightly maintaining stiffness.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Cross-section area mapping: 0: 1.0, 1:0.195, 2:0.782, 3:1.759 and higher. Member length mass = length * area_cost_area. Checking max mass 30 always. Update node_4 from (2, 2.8) to (2, 2.85) increases length members linked to it by ~0.05m. node_5 moves (2.2,3) to (2.15,3.0). This reduces areas of high stress without big geometry change. Stress limit ±30 ok. Total mass estimated <15 from previous 12.8 due to area increments but well under 30.",\n  "calculation": "Member_4: increased area from \'1\'(0.195) to \'2\'(0.782) to reduce tensile stress ~15.7. Node_4 adjusted (2, 2.85) to tighten geometry, helping redistribute forces, length increment ~0.05m adds minor mass. Members 8 and 9 areas up from \'1\'(0.195) to \'2\'(0.782) to reduce their stresses (~14, 10-> less). Node_5 moved x 2.2->2.15 keeps geometry compact, slightly increasing force paths. Mass remains below max 30 with updated areas. Estimated max stress should reduce to approx 13-14 due to these changes.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Current design under constraints but approaching higher stress on some members still. Incremental nodal shifts and area boosts on critical members can reduce stress effectively while keeping mass low. Node_4 (2,2.85), node_5(2.15,3), member_4,8,9 areas 2. Other members keep areas same to limit mass increase. This design refinement can continue if large stress reductions appear, else stop. Next iteration to re-check FEM output.
