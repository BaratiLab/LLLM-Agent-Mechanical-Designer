Total mass 10.96 < 30, so mass not the main limit. Load at node_3 with downward-left force (-10N, 45°). Supports fixed at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_4 (\'node_1\' to \'node_4\') is overstressed. Cross member at small area leads to high stress. Members connecting load node 3 insufficient. Geometry not optimal causing stress concentration in member_4. Member areas may be too small for load paths. Current truss is asymmetric with node_4 above node_3.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress on member_4: increase area, redistribute forces by adding direct diagonal braces from load node to supports, add intermediate nodes or change node_4 position to optimize force flow, keep supports fixed as required, raise node_4 vertically slightly or slightly shift horizontally to improve stiffness. Area selection can increase member_4 area. Also, consider adding member from node_2 to node_3 or node_1 to node_4 with different area to balance forces better.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node (node_5) above node_3 to better distribute forces from the load at node_3. Connect node_5 to node_3, node_4, node_1, and node_2 with optimized member areas. Keep existing nodes for load and supports the same, adjust node_4 higher to 3.0 y-coordinate for better clearance. Redesign members such that diagonal braces are stiffened. Increase area for member_4 to \'3\' or higher. Retain simple topology with newly added node for load path optimization.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 above load node_3 allows alternative load path, reducing stress concentration on existing members, especially member_4. Better triangulation increases stiffness and reduces member stresses. Increasing cross-sectional areas on critical members reduces stress to within ±30. The mass remains controlled; increase restricted to essential members. Geometry changes respect constraints for supports and loads unchanged. Load transfer paths clearer and direct to supports with intermediate node.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths of new/delta members. Assign areas to keep stresses within ±30, assess mass sum to be under 30. Member lengths calculated by Euclidean distance between nodes, use areas from available discrete set. Estimate stresses roughly by load / (area * allowable stress), adjust node_5 position or areas iteratively if marginal failure persists.",\n  \n  "calculation": "node_5 positioned at x=2.0 (same as node_3) and y=3.5 (above node_4 at 3.0). Lengths: node_3 to node_5 = 1.5, node_4 to node_5 = 0.5. Existing node_4 shifted up to y=3.0. Update member areas: member_4 increased from \'1\'=0.195 to \'3\'=1.759 for reduced stress. Add members: member_6 (node_3-node_5) area \'2\'=0.782, member_7 (node_4-node_5) area \'1\'=0.195, member_8 (node_1-node_5) area \'1\'=0.195, member_9 (node_2-node_5) area \'2\'=0.782.
