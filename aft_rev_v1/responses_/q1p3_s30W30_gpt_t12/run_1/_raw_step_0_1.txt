Max stress ±30, max mass 30 with given sectional area choices. Nodes fixed, need closed structure. The goal: connect nodes with members to form closed truss and assign areas minimizing stress and mass.",\n\n  "analysis": "Nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Load at node_3 directed down-left (10N at -45°). To form closed truss, minimize members and mass while maintaining connectivity and shear force transfer. Ideal shape: triangle connecting all 3 nodes and possibly an internal node to increase triangulation and stability, improve stress distribution. Since node_1 and node_2 are on ground (supports), node_3 at midspan, but all colinear in x-axis (0,6,2,0). As is, no vertical component for stable triangle. Introducing a new node above node_3 creates a triangle for stability and load transfer.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add a new node near node_3 vertically to form a triangle with nodes 1 and 2. Position new node (node_4) at approximately (2.0, 2.5) to give vertical height, enabling area and stress distribution. Connect members to form closed polygon: 1-4, 2-4, 3-4, 1-3, 2-3 (connecting all to distribute load). Area selection based on member length and approximate force splitting to keep stress in ±30. Use longest member length near ~3 to 4 units, so select area accordingly. Focus on short length members getting smaller area, long members get bigger area to keep stress under limits.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Load at node_3 is diagonal downward-left, transmitted via node_4 to supports. Members connected: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_1, node_2-node_4, node_2-node_3 will form a stable, closed truss. Member lengths estimated; use tension/compression stress formula σ = F/(A), F from static equilibrium; estimate forces proportionally to lengths and directions. To limit stress ±30, calculate force distribution with assumption load divides equally among nodes connected horizontally and diagonally. Use mass sum = Σ(length_i * area_i) ≤30 to adjust areas. Pick areas as integers \'1\' to \'10\' as necessary for each member.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Truss members carry axial forces only; connections pinned. Ignoring dynamic effects and self-weight. Use approximate static equilibrium at node_3 and 4. Force at node_3: 10N at -45°; approximate reactions at supports by balance.
