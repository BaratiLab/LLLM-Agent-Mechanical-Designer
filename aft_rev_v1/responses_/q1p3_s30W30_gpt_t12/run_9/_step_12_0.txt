  "preamble": "Optimize truss at iteration 11/25 to reduce max stress below 30 and mass below 30.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max_stress slightly above limit at 30.53 (>30). Total_mass 11.71 well below max 30. Support nodes fixed: node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller), load at node_3 downward-left (-10N @ 45°). Node_4 at (2.7,3.5) high stress on member_3 (node_4-node_1, area 1). Area selections in [0-10] range. Need to reduce stress on member_3 or redistribute forces.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_3 carrying tensile max stress 30.53 with smallest area (1). Increasing area here would reduce stress, but would also increase mass. Better to possibly move node_4 slightly, to reduce length L_(4-1) or force in member_3. Forces in member_1 and member_2 are compressive and moderate. Areas on members 1 and 4 can be adjusted. Member_5 has low area but also moderate stress. The problem is member_3 is stressed above limit due to geometry and load path.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try raising node_4 higher to reduce tensile force in member_3. Increasing y_4 from 3.5 to something like 4.0 with slight x_4 shift may help. Keep members similar but adjust area of member_3 from 1 to 2 or 3 for safety. Check if mass remains under 30.",
  
  "proposal": "Modify node_4 position to (2.75, 4.0). Keep nodes 1,2,3 fixed. Member connections unchanged from iteration 11. Set member_3 to area '2' (0.782) from '1' to reduce tensile stress. Check member_1 and member_2 areas remain optimized at 3 and 2, member_4 and member_5 same. This should balance stress under 30 while keeping mass low.",
  
  "reasoning": "Increasing y-coordinate of node_4 reduces angle of member_3 from node_4 to node_1, effectively increasing length slightly but reducing force demand by geometry, reducing tensile stress. Increasing area on member_3 reduces stress by inverse proportion to area. Member_1 remains at area 3 where compressive stress is moderate, member_2 adequate at area 2, element mass changes modest. Member_4 and member_5 sizes accommodate reactions. Total mass estimated well below max.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approx: L_{4-1} increases slightly pushing stress drop at higher y_4. Member_3 area increased from 1 (0.195) to 2 (0.782) quadruples area which will quarter stress if force constant. Mass increment calculated as length × density. Expected max_stress <30 and total_mass < 15.",
  
  "calculation": "Old member_3 stress ~30.53 at area 1 → new stress estimate = 30.53 × (0.195 / 0.782) ≈ 7.6, well below limit. Length change negligible. Mass of member_3 increases from 0.862 to approx 3.44 (old mass × (0.782/0.195)). Old mass 11.7129 to ~14.3 total mass still under 30. Member_1 mass = length × 1.759 unchanged. Constraints met.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Final structure has reduced max stress to below 30 by increasing member_3 area and raising node_4 slightly, all loads and supports fixed, no duplicates. Member areas chosen to not exceed mass constraint.",
