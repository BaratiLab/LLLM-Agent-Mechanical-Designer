  "preamble": "Optimize the existing 2D truss to reduce max stress while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress is 20.15 < 30 and total mass 17.2862 < 30. Node_1 and node_2 fixed due to support, node_3 fixed due to load. Node_4 at (2,3) can be moved.",
  
  "analysis": "Max compressive stress is member_4 at 20.1455 with small area 0.195. High stress indicates either need to increase cross sectional area or adjust geometry. Total mass margin ~12.7 units available. Adjust node_4 vertically or horizontally to redistribute loads and reduce high stress. Member cross sections can be shuffled to thicker at critical members. Maintain closed truss shape. Members lengths to be recalculated after node shift. Area change to limit mass <30 and stress < ±30 is feasible.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Move node_4 slightly right and up to decrease force on member_4. Increase member_4 area from '1': 0.195 to '2': 0.782 to reduce stress and member_3 area can be reduced to balance mass. Members_1 and 5 can remain area '2' for stability. Recalculate member length and estimate stress improvements.",
  
  "reasoning": "Node_4 move to (2.6,3.2) to increase length member_4 and angle to dispel load to other members. Area increase of member_4 to 0.782 triples capacity lowering stress below limit. Reduce member_3 area from '3' = 1.759 to '1' = 0.195 cutting mass by 3 units and decrease stress margin since member_3 is compressive low stress origin (3.22). Members_1 and 5 remain area '2' as their stresses are moderate and reducing their areas may increase stress.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Length member_4 new-length ~ sqrt((6-2.6)^2 + (0-3.2)^2) = sqrt(11.56 + 10.24) = sqrt(21.8)=4.67; With area 0.782, stress ~ previous/(area_new/area_old) = 20.15 ×0.195/0.782= ~5.0 < 30. Mass roughly area*length recalculated for member_4 ~4.67*0.782=3.65 < old 0.975*3 (approx 2.93) slightly mass increase but balanced by reducing member_3 area thrice molecular. Total mass likely still below limit. Member_3 length ~ sqrt((2-2)^2 + (3.2-3)^2)=0.2 small reposition may need to consider reducing to same or similar position.",
  
  "calculation": "Member length after node shift: m4=4.67, m3 ~ sqrt((2 - 0)^2 + (3.2 - 0)^2) = sqrt(4+10.24)=3.5, smaller than older 3 calculating correct offset. Choosing node_4 at (2.6,3.2) improves moment distribution lowering stress in member_4 with area boost. Swap member_3 to area '1' mass reduction ~3× previously huge mass. Net total mass ~ indoor balance near 17 retained safely well under 30.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Design is improved with load redistribution and optimized areas to yield tensile and compressive stress below 20 consistently. Mass well below limit. Node3 and supports fixed. Node4 displaced precisely as allowed with membres updated. No duplicate nodes or members. Validate constraints satisfied before next iteration. Likely near optimal but allow 1-2 runs more.",
