Mass is 14.54, well under 30. Increase position height of node_4 to better align load path may reduce member_3 stress. Current areas: member_1 (id 4) large area due to negative stress, member_3 (id 1) small area with high tension. Areas do not correlate perfectly with stresses; better sizing may improve stress. Node_3 vertical position fixed on x=2 on baseline. Only node_4 can move (x=2.4, y=3.5).</p> Constraints enforced: no moving load/support nodes, member connectivity unchanged, areas selected from given list. Reflect on history—previous tries lowering node_4 height reduce stress but max stress hovered around 14, current iter increased height but stress rose too. Modal about area: reduce superfluous excess area of member_1 might relieve connection force for member_3 tension, but careful to keep max stress below 30 tensile/compressive. Probably reducing area member_1 slightly but raising node_4 vertically may balance stress better.</p>",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress in member_3 controlled by node_4 vertical position and sizing. Member_1 large area (4) results in low compressive stress in -3 range, high mass. Member_3 low area (1) close to tensile limit 29.3. Symmetric stress reduction strategy: decrease member_1 area from 4 to 3, raise node_4 up slightly (3.7~3.8) to reduce tensile stress on member_3. Slightly higher fiber vertical coordinate reduces bending moments induced quick tension peaks. Maintain other members\' areas or reduce where not heavily stressed (members 4 and 5).",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Decrease largest area (4) in member_1, where compressive stress is small (-3.294 MPa), to 3 (from 4) reduces mass without risking high compressive stress. Also, increasing y coordinate of node_4 from 3.5 to ~3.8 gives longer member lengths to distribute load and strain energy more evenly, expecting tension in member_3 to reduce. Member areas for others kept fixed except possibly reduce area in lightly stressed member_5 from 1 to 0 (area 1 code is 0.195, 0 is full 1.0; safer to keep area consistent). Will keep member_5 at area 1 for lighter edge. Member_2 and member_4 areas maintained for continuity in load distribution and support.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_4: (2.4,3.5).

Mass reduces by ~2.7 but tension stabilizes. Member_3: node_4 to node_1 changes length from sqrt(2.4^2+3.5^2)=~4.205 to sqrt(2.4^2+3.8^2)=~4.47; length increase improves stress distrib. Member_3 area kept at 1 (0.195). Checking max mass sum: Member1(3.518)+member2(2.75)+member3(0.78)+member4(3.93)+member5(0.78)=~11.75 well under 30.
