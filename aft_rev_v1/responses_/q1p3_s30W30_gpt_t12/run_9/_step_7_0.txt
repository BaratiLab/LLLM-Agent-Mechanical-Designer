  "preamble": "Optimize node 4 position and fine-tune member areas for stress reduction.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints max stress ±30, max mass 30; all load/support nodes fixed; current max stress ~13.9 within limits, mass ~13.9 well below limits.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design is feasible; no stress or mass constraints violated. Member stresses are moderate but range from -13.9 to +7.7. Mass is low enough to reallocate member areas if needed to reduce max stress, especially member_1 (-13.9) under compression is highest stress magnitude. Node_4 moved upward in last step; further vertical adjustment may reduce stress in critical members. Area assignments are uniform (all area '2'), potentially suboptimal.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 high compressive stress - may reduce stress by increasing height strategically. Member_5 has lowest stress (-3.4) and might sustain lower area (area=1) for mass savings and area reallocation. Potentially increase area of member_1 to reduce stress; decrease less stressed member areas for mass efficiency.",

  "reasoning": "To reduce max compressive stress on member_1, increasing vertical distance of node_4 is helpful; upper node should be balanced to distribute load and reduce eccentricities. Areas can be adjusted: increase area of member_1 from '2'(0.782) to '3'(1.759) to halve stress, reduce member_5 area from '2' to '1'(0.195), and slightly reduce member_3 from '2' to '1' given modest tensile stress (7.7), to manage overall mass. Keep other members at area 2 to preserve stiffness and min overall stress.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assume stress approximately inversely proportional to cross-sectional area, linear relation: doubling area halves stress. Member lengths from node position vectors. Node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4 currently (2.5, 3.1): length m1 ~ dist(0,0)-(2,0) = 2m; m2 dist(2,0)-(2.5,3.1) ~3.144m; verify these for fine calibration.",

  "calculation": "Current areas all '2', total mass 13.918. Propose area upgrades: m1: 2→3 increases area from 0.782→1.759, expected stress halves from ~-13.9 to ~-7.0; mass approx doubles for m1 mass 1.564 → ~3.5. Decrease m5 area 2→1 reduces very low stress -3.4 stress safely; mass from 3.128 → 0.61 mass savings ~2.5. Decrease m3 area 2→1 reduces 3.1 mass to ~1.5 to compensate m1 increase. Net mass change negligible, stress reduced. Shift node_4 slightly up and left to (2.4, 3.2) to reduce moment inducing member_1 stress further while keeping structure stable and closed. Run brief heuristic: raising node_4 approx 0.1 up and 0.1 left balances moments, may reduce compressive stress on member_1.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Proposed node4: (2.4, 3.2), member areas m1=3, m2=2, m3=1, m4=2, m5=1. Confirm no duplicate connection, all loads/support nodes fixed. Expect max stress <13.9 improved to ~7.0 and total mass around current 13.9 sustainable.",
