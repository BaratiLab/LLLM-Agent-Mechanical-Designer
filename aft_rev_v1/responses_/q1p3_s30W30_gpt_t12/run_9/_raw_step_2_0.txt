Max stress ±30, mass ≤ 30. Current max stress violates limit at members 2 and 3.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has stress -36.89 and +31.15 in critical members exceeding ±30. Mass reduced from previous 17.29 to 9.78, well below 30 limit. Node_4 shifted to (2.6,3.2) decreased mass but increased stress on member_2 (to -36.89). Member areas for critical members are relatively small, possibly causing high stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce high stress, consider increasing cross-sectional area of stressed members or repositioning node_4 to achieve better force distribution. Avoid small area for member_2; possibly increase to area ID \'2\' or higher. Ensure stable triangulated structure preventing high tension/compression spikes.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Relocate node_4 to a slightly more central vertical position (2.4, 3.0). Increase area of member_2 and member_3 to \'2\' (0.782) to increase capacity. Keep areas of other members as before or adapt as needed. Maintain original nodes for support and load. Member connections preserved. This gives a stiffer structure preventing excessive stresses > ±30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_2 currently has area \'1\' (0.195), very small, leading to high stress: increasing area reduces stress for same load. Moving node_4 slightly down reduces force leverage and stress on diagonal members. Member_3 is several times stressed positively at 31.15, area increase helps bring it below 30. Other members less critical. Mass remains under limit by moderate area increases.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Areas: member_1=2 (0.782), member_2=2 (0.782), member_3=2 (0.782), member_4=2 (0.782), member_5=2 (0.782).
