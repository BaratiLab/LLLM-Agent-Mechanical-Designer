We need to add nodes and members connecting all to form a stable closed geometry like a triangle or includes vertical/horizontal members to resist given load and constraints.",\n\n    "analysis": "The initial nodes are colinear; this is statically unstable and cannot form a closed truss. We must add at least one node above x-axis to form a triangle, ensuring geometric stability and closure. The load (magnitude -10, direction -45°) acts diagonally down-left at node_3, which indicates tension/compression in members near node_3. To resist, members connected must form triangles. We\'ll add node_4 above node_3 for closure.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Node_4 will be at (2.0, h) where h>0. Lengths and cross-sectional areas must balance stress and mass. Given constraint max stress ±30 and mass <= 30. Areas chosen from discrete sets 0 to 10. Member lengths calculated from coordinates. Stress approximated by force/member cross-sectional area ratio, considering load equilibrium. Chose the smallest h making the triangle stable and minimizes member lengths thus mass.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Added node_4 at (2.0, 3.0). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_1, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_2 so the truss is closed. Lengths used to estimate mass. Heights create tension/compression force around applied load. Assume static equilibrium to distribute load stresses in members. Area selections balance stress and mass constraints. Use smaller area for longer members to reduce mass but ensure stress within limits.
