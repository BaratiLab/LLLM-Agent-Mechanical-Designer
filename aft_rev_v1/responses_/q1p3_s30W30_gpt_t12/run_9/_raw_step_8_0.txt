Current stresses near limit at member_3. Slight mass inefficiency detected. Load at node_3 is 10N down-left (-45°). Supports fixed at nodes 1 and 2 on the ground line.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The highest tensile stress is in member_3 (30.22) and is just over the allowable limit. The mass is acceptable but could be reduced with better area distribution. Members_3 and 5 use smaller areas \'1\' which keep mass low but do not allow stress margin. Existing layout of 4-node truss is largely effective. Load is applied between supports, generating high stress in the diagonal members connected to node_4.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on stress reduction in member_3 and improving load paths by optimizing areas. Keep node_4 height and horizontal position aimed at balancing load transfer and length of members to reduce mass and stress. Check possibility of slight nodal position refinement to decrease stresses and align force flow.",\n\n  "proposal": "Maintain current node positions except move node_4 slightly closer to node_3 horizontally and slightly higher vertically for stress relief and optimize cross-sectional areas: increase area of member_3 and member_5 for extra capacity, reduce area of member_1 if possible to save mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_3 is highly stressed in tension, upgrading its cross section along with adjacent member_5 will strengthen tension load path. Member_1 in compression has low stress; reduce its area to save mass. Members connecting node_4 adjusted slightly to improve geometry and load transfer conditions.
