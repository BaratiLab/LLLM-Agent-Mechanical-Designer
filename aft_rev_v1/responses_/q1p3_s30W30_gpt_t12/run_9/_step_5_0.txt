  "preamble": "Optimizing truss to reduce max stress, maintain constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress currently 14.5 < 30, mass 12.89 < 30 remaining satisfied. Load node_3 fixed at (2.0,0.0), supports fixed. Node_4 moved progressively downward and right from 3.2 to 2.75, resulting in marginal change in max stress (~14.5).",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress mainly in member_5 (-14.5), potentially prone to high tension/compression from load at node_3. Members around node_4 show moderate tensile and compressive stress values. Geometry shows somewhat skewed quad approximated by node_1, node_3, node_4, node_2. Member_5 has smallest area 0.195 (id '1'), could be adjusted or node_4 position altered to reduce stress concentration. Slight increase of height of node_4 previously helped reduce max stress (~20 → 14), but recent shift lowered height and increased stress slightly.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on repositioning node_4 slightly upward and slightly left to balance the internal force paths and reduce max stress. Potential increasing of area of highest stressed members for reducing stress while keeping mass under limit. Examine member areas — majority at area=2 or 3; member_5 smallest (area=1), consider increasing it but balanced with length and mass constraints.",

  "reasoning": "Positioning node_4 influences lever arm and force distribution. Increasing node_4 y coordinate can shift force paths to reduce max stress in member_5. Nodes_1 and 2 fixed. Members connected to node_4 sized mostly with area 2; member_1 with area 3 (node_1-node_3 length approx 2, was kept at higher area). Member_5 area currently 1 (0.195). Increasing member_5 area might reduce stress but mass penalty could be offset by reducing area on others, particularly member_1 which is large (area 3). Try increasing member_5 area to 2 and decreasing member_1 area to 2. Save mass to keep total below 30. Node_4 position to be adjusted to approximately (2.5, 2.9) to improve stiffness.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculations: member lengths approximate from given coords. Member_1 length ~2 (node_1 to node_3 at x=0 to 2), Member_2 length sqrt((2.7-2)^2+(2.75-0)^2) ~ sqrt(0.7^2+2.75^2)=~2.84. Member_3 length similar approximate ~3.2, member_4 length longer from (2.7,2.75) to (6,0), approx sqrt(3.3^2+2.75^2) ~ 4.3. Member_5 length from (2, 0) to (6,0) = 4.0.",
  "calculation": "Set member_5 area to '2' (0.782) from '1' (0.195), expecting stress reduction roughly proportional by increasing cross-section area. Decrease member_1 area to '2' from '3' and reposition node_4 to (2.5, 2.9) to achieve better load distribution and stiffness, preventing excessive tensile stresses in member_5. Estimated mass: member_5 mass: 4m x 0.782 = 3.128, up from 0.78; member_1 mass: 2m x 0.782=1.564, down from 3.518. Net increase ~ -3.518 +1.564 + 0.78 -3.128 = -4.3 nets mass reduction potential untaken by node geometry optimization. Total mass anticipated < current 12.89, safely under 30 constraint.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Check stress reduction by area increase in member_5 and relocating node_4 upward expected to redistribute forces favorably. Maintain existing member connections. Constraints of max stress ±30 and mass below 30 satisfied with changes. Node_4 movable since neither load nor support, changed precisely as allowed.",
