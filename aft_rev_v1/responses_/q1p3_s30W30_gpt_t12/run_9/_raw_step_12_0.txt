Increasing area here would reduce stress, but would also increase mass. Better to possibly move node_4 slightly, to reduce length L_(4-1) or force in member_3. Forces in member_1 and member_2 are compressive and moderate. Areas on members 1 and 4 can be adjusted. Member_5 has low area but also moderate stress. The problem is member_3 is stressed above limit due to geometry and load path.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try raising node_4 higher to reduce tensile force in member_3. Increasing y_4 from 3.5 to something like 4.0 with slight x_4 shift may help. Keep members similar but adjust area of member_3 from 1 to 2 or 3 for safety. Check if mass remains under 30.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Modify node_4 position to (2.75, 4.0). Keep nodes 1,2,3 fixed. Member connections unchanged from iteration 11. Set member_3 to area \'2\' (0.782) from \'1\' to reduce tensile stress. Check member_1 and member_2 areas remain optimized at 3 and 2, member_4 and member_5 same. This should balance stress under 30 while keeping mass low.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing y-coordinate of node_4 reduces angle of member_3 from node_4 to node_1, effectively increasing length slightly but reducing force demand by geometry, reducing tensile stress. Increasing area on member_3 reduces stress by inverse proportion to area. Member_1 remains at area 3 where compressive stress is moderate, member_2 adequate at area 2, element mass changes modest.
