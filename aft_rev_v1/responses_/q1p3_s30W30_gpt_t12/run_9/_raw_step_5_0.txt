Load node_3 fixed at (2.0,0.0), supports fixed. Node_4 moved progressively downward and right from 3.2 to 2.75, resulting in marginal change in max stress (~14.5).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress mainly in member_5 (-14.5), potentially prone to high tension/compression from load at node_3. Members around node_4 show moderate tensile and compressive stress values. Geometry shows somewhat skewed quad approximated by node_1, node_3, node_4, node_2. Member_5 has smallest area 0.195 (id \'1\'), could be adjusted or node_4 position altered to reduce stress concentration. Slight increase of height of node_4 previously helped reduce max stress (~20 → 14), but recent shift lowered height and increased stress slightly.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on repositioning node_4 slightly upward and slightly left to balance the internal force paths and reduce max stress. Potential increasing of area of highest stressed members for reducing stress while keeping mass under limit. Examine member areas — majority at area=2 or 3; member_5 smallest (area=1), consider increasing it but balanced with length and mass constraints.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Positioning node_4 influences lever arm and force distribution. Increasing node_4 y coordinate can shift force paths to reduce max stress in member_5. Nodes_1 and 2 fixed. Members connected to node_4 sized mostly with area 2; member_1 with area 3 (node_1-node_3 length approx 2, was kept at higher area). Member_5 area currently 1 (0.195). Increasing member_5 area might reduce stress but mass penalty could be offset by reducing area on others, particularly member_1 which is large (area 3). Try increasing member_5 area to 2 and decreasing member_1 area to 2. Save mass to keep total below 30.

Member_3 length similar approximate ~3.2, member_4 length longer from (2.7,2.75) to (6,0), approx sqrt(3.3^2+2.75^2) ~ 4.3.
