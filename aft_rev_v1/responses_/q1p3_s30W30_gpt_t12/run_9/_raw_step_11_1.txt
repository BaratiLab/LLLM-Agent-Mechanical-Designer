Mass is 12.2558 well under max 30. Nodes for load/support fixed, can adjust node_4 only. Member areas selected from given set.",\n  "analysis": "Member_3 (\'node_4\'-\'node_1\') has highest stress ~28.59 (tensile). To reduce stress, reduce axial force or increase member strength (area). But increasing area increases mass. Better strategy could be to adjust node_4 position to favor load path and reduce force in member_3.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_4 moved up in past iterations to reduce compressive stresses. Current at (2.4,3.8). If node_4 shifted slightly right and downward to balance forces, might reduce stress on member_3 while member_2 & member_4 still handle load.",\n  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 closer to node_3 horizontally distributes load more evenly between members connected to node_3, decreases tension in member_3 (\'node_4\'-\'node_1\'), reducing max stress. Keep node_4 above node_3 to maintain structure shape and member orientations.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate changes: shift node_4 from (2.4,3.8) to approx (2.7, 3.5) to enhance load path; keep known areas from last iteration for mass control. Validate mass remains < 30, anticipate slight mass increase but within limit.",\n  "calculation": "New node_4: x=2.7, y=3.5. Member lengths approx; compute lengths: member_3 length ~ sqrt((2.7-0)^2 + (3.5-0)^2) ≈ 4.4; member_1 ((2 - 0),0)=2; others updated accordingly. Keep member_3 area=1 to keep mass small, rest of areas last iteration: member_1 area=3, member_2=2, member_4=2, member_5=1. Expect max stress reduced below 28.59 by better load path.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Check mass after changes expected around ~13-14 max, below 30.
