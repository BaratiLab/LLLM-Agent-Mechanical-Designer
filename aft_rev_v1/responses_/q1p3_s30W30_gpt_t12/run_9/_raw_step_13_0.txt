Current max stress is 9.82, well below limits, mass 15.31 below max. Nodes for load/support fixed. Allowed to move only node_4.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has members mostly area IDs 1 to 3. Max compressive/tensile stresses are about ±10 MPa, well below ±30 MPa constraint with good margin. Mass is about half the max allowed. Moving the free node (node_4) within limits hasn\'t improved stress substantially in previous steps, max stress significantly reduced already from early iterations. Member_5 carrying only smallest area to keep mass low, stress below limit. Design is balanced and stable.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress margins are large, no member near the limit. Mass has room but sizes have increased reasonably. Load at node_3 and supports at node_1 and node_2 are fixed, restricting geometry change. Slightly moving node_4 upward increased stresses previously, but now max stress is near minimum possible with current member layout. Changing member areas was optimized as well in history.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Refining node_4 positioning in small increments won\'t significantly lower already low max stress 9.82 MPa. Member size/area distribution is efficient: larger areas for longer compression members, smaller areas for tensile members with lower force. Load transfer path is lateral from node_3 diagonally to supports, minimal bending due to pin/roller supports. Further refinement will have diminishing returns.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Formulae: Stress = Force / Area, Area indexed by {0:1,...,10:19.548}. Mass scales with member length x area index. Members with high stress have larger areas prudently chosen. Member forces normalized very acceptable levels. Highest stress is well under limit, indicating no need to increase area or change geometry further.",\n  \n  "calculation": "No further node_4 movement adjustments needed. All areas well placed matching required stress levels. Total mass 15.31 below max 30. Max stress 9.82 significantly safer than threshold 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "No benefits from further optimization, the design complies fully with constraints creditably.
