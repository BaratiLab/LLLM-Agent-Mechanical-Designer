Move node_4 slightly to achieve better geometry (raise y to increase truss height), adjust member areas to reduce max stress. Use area ids {member_1:4 (~3.128), member_2:2 (~0.782), member_3:1 (~0.195), member_4:2 (~0.782), member_5:1 (~0.195)} to reduce mass and stress.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Higher area in member_1 to reduce high stress tension/compression due to direct load transfer. Smaller areas on members farther from load/all under less stress to save mass. Reposition node_4 upward to form better force triangle, spreading forces more evenly and lowering peak stress.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Length(member_1) ~ sqrt(2^2+0^2) =2; larger area lowers stress inversely proportional to area*length.
