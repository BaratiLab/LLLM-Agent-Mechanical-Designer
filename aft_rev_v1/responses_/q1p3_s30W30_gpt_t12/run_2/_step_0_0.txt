    "preamble": "Optimize a closed 2D truss with 3 fixed nodes under load, minimizing stress within ±30 and mass ≤30, area from preset discrete values.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given 3 nodes: node_1(0,0 pinned), node_2(6,0 roller), node_3(2,0) with -10 N @ -45° at node_3. Need closed truss means all nodes interconnected forming at least one triangle for stability.",

    "analysis": "Nodes are colinear initially (all y=0), so to form a closed stable truss triangle, need to add a vertical displacement on one node. Cannot move load/support nodes, but can add a new node to enable a triangular closed structure or adjust node_3 slightly in feasible manner. But instruction #5 forbids changing node positions. So add a new node_4 above node_3 to form a triangle node_1-node_2-node_4 and closed links. The load is at node_3 on the baseline. Connect node_3 to node_4 and nodes 1,2; create members for closed loop designs (like a truss with nodal quadrilateral). Then assign areas from given list considering length*area sum ≤30 and stresses ≤30. Use simple axial stress = force / (area) (force calculated via equilibrium of vertical and horizontal forces).",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Must keep maximum length*area sum to ≤30; try small areas for members under lower stress and bigger for high stress assuming ternary force distribution. Use approximate static equilibrium and Pythagoras for length calculations. Length is Euclidean distance between nodes for mass calculation.",

    "reasoning": "To form closed truss: Add 'node_4' at (2.0, 3.0) (3 units above node_3). Members: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, plus baseline members node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2. This creates two triangles sharing node_4. Load at node_3 translates partly vertical/horizontal force to node_4 and others. Assume linear truss members in tension or compression. Areas selected to control stress (Force = stress × area) with max stress 30. Basic calculation: use force components balance as approximate axial forces. Mass approximation: sum over members length × area_id from given dictionary, with total ≤30.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2,3). Member lengths calculated by 2D distance. Areas selected in range 0.195 to 3.128 initially to keep mass ≤30. Stress approximated by |F|/(Area). Use simple static equilibrium: At node_3 loaded with force of 10 N at -45° (Fx = -7.07 N, Fy = -7.07 N). Member forces distribute load from node_3 to connected nodes. Approximating member force proportional to member length and member angle on load components.",
