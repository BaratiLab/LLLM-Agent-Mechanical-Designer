  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max member stress while keeping constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 9.76 under ±30 is good; total mass 19.2556 < 30 is within limit. Load at node_3 and support nodes fixed. Areas assigned moderate to high. Member_5 has highest stress (-9.7639).",
  
  "analysis": "Stress mainly concentrated in the diagonal member_5 (node_3-node_4). Length of members and cross-sectional areas heavily influence stress. By adjusting node_4 position, can change geometry to better distribute stress and reduce member_5 stress. Load and supports fixed; only node_4 can move. Keep the truss closed and statically stable.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing vertical component of node_4 from 2.7 towards a slightly lower height might generate more balanced axial forces and longer members that reduce stresses. Also moving node_4 slightly horizontally affects angles and reduces high compressive stress on member_5.",

  "reasoning": "Member_5 has highest compressive stress; decreasing length or changing orientation of member_5 reduces this. Trade-off: changing node_4 affects member_3 and member_4 stresses slightly, but can stay within bounds. To better distribute forces, move node_4 closer to node_3 horizontally (reduce from 3.1 to ~2.8) and slightly lower vertically (to ~2.3), lessening extreme forces on member_5 while keeping truss closed and stable.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current lengths approx:\n member_1 (n1-n3): 2.0,\n member_2 (n3-n2): 4.0,\n member_3 (n1-n4): sqrt((3.1)^2 + (2.7)^2)~4.11,\n member_4 (n4-n2): sqrt((6-3.1)^2 + 2.7^2)~3.40,\n member_5 (n3-n4): sqrt((3.1-2.0)^2 + 2.7^2)~2.93\nBy decreasing node_4 x to 2.8 and y to 2.3: member_5 length goes to sqrt((2.8-2)^2 + 2.3^2)= approx 2.42 (shorter), expected to reduce compression stress. Member_3 and member_4 lengths will slightly decrease; reinforcing member_4 area or redistributing areas can help keep mass low and stresses balanced.",
  
  "calculation": "Update node_4: (2.8, 2.3)\nMember areas from previous suggestions mostly balanced. Keep member_5 area = 2 (0.782) or slightly reduce area since length reduces stress effect. Use member_1:3, member_3:3 to maintain strength on inclined members.\nTotal mass estimated slightly reduced due to smaller lengths. Max stress expected to drop below current 9.76, aiming for ~7-8 range.\nMember mass recalculated with {length × area} sums under 30.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "No change to load/support nodes ensures constraints hold. Geometry change small and improves stress. Design is still a closed truss with no redundant members. The design accounts for member forces calculated from geometric changes and should minimize max stress further. Continue optimization in next iteration for any finer tuning.",
