Areas fixed, so only reposition node_4 allowed. Load on node_3, supports on node_1 and node_2 fixed.",\n  "analysis": "Max stresses concentrated on member_5 (-9.51) and member_1 (-6.95). Member lengths influence mass; aim to reduce stress on member_5 by altering node_4 upward/backward for better force distribution. Previous iterations show slightly lower max stresses near (2.8-3.0, 2.3-2.8). Slight further repositioning of node_4 to better balance tension/compression expected to help.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_5 links node_3 to node_4; shortening/stabilizing this diagonal and adjusting vertical position can reduce bending stress. Maintaining loading node_3 at (2,0) and fixed supports at (0,0) and (6,0). Avoid excessive lengthening increasing mass.",\n  "reasoning": "Currently, the stress magnitudes favor tension in member_5. By slightly increasing the height of node_4, the truss triangle becomes more equilateral, improving load path. However, too high y makes inertia large. Slight translation of node_4 leftward from 2.85 to ~2.75 while increasing y slightly from 2.6 to ~2.75 can improve force paths to reduce member_5 stress without increasing mass significantly. Member areas kept constant as changes had minor mass impact.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Keep node_1 at (0,0), node_2 at (6,0), node_3 at (2,0). Adjust node_4 near (2.75, 2.75). Check approximate member lengths and mass: member_1 length ~ sqrt((2.75)^2+(2.75)^2)=3.89, assign area 3 => mass = length*1.759=6.84; member_5 length ~ sqrt((2-2.75)^2+(0-2.75)^2)=2.85*0.782=2.23 mass reduced; this keeps total mass roughly under 19. Adjust should not exceed max stress constraint (Â±30), prior max was ~9.5.",\n  "calculation": "New node_4 at (2.75, 2.75) leaves nodes fixed per constraints. Member areas unchanged.
