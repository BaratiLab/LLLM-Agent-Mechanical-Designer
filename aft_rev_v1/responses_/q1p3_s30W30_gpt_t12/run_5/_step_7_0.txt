  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to further reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress approximately 9.29, well below ±30; mass 18.42 < 30 allowed. Loaded node_3 (-10 at -45°), supports fixed.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress member_5 (-9.2892) is still near 9.3 and seems critical. Member areas mostly fixed with member_1 and member_3 area 3, others mostly 2. Node_4 moved around in previous iterations within range (2.6, 2.55) to (3.5, 3.5) in history. Current position reduces stress from prior higher values. Further fine adjustment of node_4 can balance member forces to lower peak stress.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Members connected form a closed 4-noded truss with member_5 diagonal critical. Possibly shifting node_4 closer to node_3 vertically lower the stress on member_5 tension. Keep supports fixed: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Try reducing node_4's y from 2.55 slightly, x close to 2.6.",
  
  "reasoning": "Lowering y of node_4 slightly reduces diagonal member_5 length and forces, while trying to maintain truss closure and stable load path. Member lengths and areas unchanged to avoid mass increase. Member_5 stresses are tension; slight geometric adjustment can reduce stress concentration. Areas remain the same: member_1 & 3 at 3, members 2,4,5 at 2 per input.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Estimate member lengths: node_4 at (2.55,2.4) range. member_5 length ∼ sqrt((2.0-2.6)^2 + (0-2.4)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.36+5.76) = sqrt(6.12) = 2.47, less than previous ~2.65. Reduced length => reduced stress for same force. Mass stays similar or slightly less.",
  
  "calculation": "Change node_4 to (2.65, 2.45) approx (x+0.05, y-0.1). Length member_5 shorter, expect stress reduction close to 8.8-9 range. Areas kept from iteration_6 unchanged: member_1(3), member_2(2), member_3(3), member_4(2), member_5(2). Mass expected slightly less or same below 19, well under 30. Verify constraints all met.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Optimized node_4 position slightly to reduce diagonal tension stress while maintaining existing members and areas. Further lowering of max stress near 9.0 from 9.29 expected without violating constraints or support node positions. Continue optimization in next steps.",
