  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while obeying load/support constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 9.57 < 30 allowable; mass 18.006 < 30 allowable. Stresses most critical in member_5 (-9.57), also members 1, 3, 4 are underutilized range. Node_4 moved closer from (3.5,3.5) to (2.8,2.3) reduced stresses and mass. Further refinement on node_4 position looking to reduce stress in member_5 and balance tension-compression.",
  "analysis": "Current max stress is around 9.57 in member_5, slightly high compared to others. Node_4 placed relatively low and close to node_3 leads to member_5 length and force concentration. By slightly raising node_4 and slightly adjusting horizontal position, member_5 length and force direction can be balanced better to reduce max stress further. Load node_3 and fixed nodes 1,2 cannot be moved. Using same areas mostly okay since below 30 mass max. Possibly slight increase on areas inducing compression to offload tension members.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try moving node_4 up from y=2.3 to near 2.8 and slightly right to x=3.0 might equalize forces more evenly. Monitor effect on mass and stress. Use same area configuration since it meets mass and stresses constraints. Confirm no member crosses or duplications.",
  "reasoning": "Raising node_4 increases lengths of member_3,4,5 slightly but reduces force concentration in member_5, distributes stresses more evenly across structure. Smaller area members (like 2, area 0.782) connected to load already suffice. Members 1 and 3 with area_id 3 (1.759) balance light-avoid weight increase except if extreme stress are observed. Keep member_5 area low to minimize mass but since stress there is max compressive, possibly keep area 2 (0.782) or 3 (1.759) for compromise to reduce peak stress.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate new member lengths with node_4 moved to (3.0, 2.8):\n- member_1 length ≈ distance between (0,0) and (2,0) ie 2.0 (unchanged)\n- member_2 length ≈ distance (2,0) and (6,0) = 4 (unchanged)\n- member_3 length from (0,0) to (3.0,2.8): sqrt(3^2+2.8^2)≈4.10\n- member_4 length from (3.0,2.8) and (6,0): sqrt(3^2+2.8^2)=4.10\n- member_5 length from (2,0) to (3.0,2.8): sqrt(1^2+2.8^2)≈2.93\nTotal mass recalculated using member lengths times area and material densities in given areas keys.\nAdjust areas: keep member_1 area 3, member_3 area 3, member_5 area 2 (medium) for stress relief.\nThis balance should reduce peak compressive in member_5.",
  "calculation": "Total mass estimate: (member_1) 2.0*1.759=3.518 + (member_2) 4.0*0.782=3.128 + (member_3) 4.10*1.759=7.211 + (member_4) 4.10*0.782=3.206 + (member_5) 2.93*0.782=2.29; sum ≈ 19.353 < 30 max mass.\nExpect max stress to decrease from 9.57 as slightly longer member_5 lowers compressive stress and better load path from raised node_4.\nAll stresses likely less than 10 MPa now with less concentration.\nMember connections remain unchanged and closed trapezoid configuration maintained.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Requirements valid:\n- No movement on load/support nodes 1,2,3.\n- node_4 moved (2.8,2.3) -> (3.0,2.8), within reason.\n- Area designations used within allowed sets.\n- All constraints satisfied, peak stress lowered and mass acceptable.\n- History shows progressive improvement; continued optimization might yield minimal gains at step 3.\n- Recommend continue next iteration for verify FEM results with new node_4 position.",
