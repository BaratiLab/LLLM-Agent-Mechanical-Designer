Load at node_3 and support nodes fixed. Areas assigned moderate to high. Member_5 has highest stress (-9.7639).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Stress mainly concentrated in the diagonal member_5 (node_3-node_4). Length of members and cross-sectional areas heavily influence stress. By adjusting node_4 position, can change geometry to better distribute stress and reduce member_5 stress. Load and supports fixed; only node_4 can move. Keep the truss closed and statically stable.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing vertical component of node_4 from 2.7 towards a slightly lower height might generate more balanced axial forces and longer members that reduce stresses. Also moving node_4 slightly horizontally affects angles and reduces high compressive stress on member_5.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Member_5 has highest compressive stress; decreasing length or changing orientation of member_5 reduces this. Trade-off: changing node_4 affects member_3 and member_4 stresses slightly, but can stay within bounds. To better distribute forces, move node_4 closer to node_3 horizontally (reduce from 3.1 to ~2.8) and slightly lower vertically (to ~2.3), lessening extreme forces on member_5 while keeping truss closed and stable.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Current lengths approx:\\n member_1 (n1-n3): 2.0,\\n member_2 (n3-n2): 4.0,\\n member_3 (n1-n4): sqrt((3.1)^2 + (2.7)^2)~4.11,\\n member_4 (n4-n2): sqrt((6-3.1)^2 + 2.7^2)~3.40,\\n member_5 (n3-n4): sqrt((3.1-2.0)^2 + 2.7^2)~2.93\\nBy decreasing node_4 x to 2.8 and y to 2.3: member_5 length goes to sqrt((2.8-2)^2 + 2.3^2)= approx 2.42 (shorter), expected to reduce compression stress. Member_3 and member_4 lengths will slightly decrease; reinforcing member_4 area or redistributing areas can help keep mass low and stresses balanced.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Update node_4: (2.8, 2.3)\\nMember areas from previous suggestions mostly balanced. Keep member_5 area = 2 (0.782) or slightly reduce area since length reduces stress effect. Use member_1:3, member_3:3 to maintain strength on inclined members.\\nTotal mass estimated slightly reduced due to smaller lengths. Max stress expected to drop below current 9.76, aiming for ~7-8 range.\\nMember mass recalculated with {length × area} sums under 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "No change to load/support nodes ensures constraints hold.
