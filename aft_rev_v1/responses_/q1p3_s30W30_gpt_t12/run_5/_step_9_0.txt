  "preamble": "Current structure satisfies constraints with minimized stress.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max |stress| ≤ 30, total mass ≤ 30. Current max stress ~9.3, total mass ~17.78 well within constraints. Key nodes on load/support fixed: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), load at node_3(2,0). Node_4 position adjustable; members connect these nodes with assigned areas.",
  "analysis": "Max stress is low compared to limit (9.3 vs 30), total mass is also safely below max (17.78 vs 30). Prior iterations show stress plateauing near ~9.3 with node_4 close between y=2.3 to 2.75. Reducing node_4 height or moving it laterally increased mass or stress. Member areas are reasonably assigned with higher areas to longer or higher stress members.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress reduction below 9 may require major redesign or adding nodes/members but is limited by constraint to four nodes and keep closed truss. Current truss stays simple and uses moderate section areas (member_1 and member_3 use area '3'), others '2'.",
  "reasoning": "Given constraints and node/fixed supports/loads, current member sections are balanced. Attempts to adjust node_4 height and lateral position mostly lead to either mass increase or stress worsening in past iterations. The stress distribution is fairly uniform and all stress magnitudes are well below allowed limit. Shear internal forces would be balanced in current design. Since no mass limit benefit is to reduce member section size further - increased stress or loss of structure integrity occurs.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Members length with current nodes roughly: member_1 ~ distance(0,0)-(2,0)=2, member_2 ~(2,0)-(6,0)=4, member_3 ~(0,0)-(2.55,2.3)~3.47, member_4 ~(2.55,2.3)-(6,0)~4.27, member_5 ~(2,0)-(2.55,2.3)~2.52. Selected areas: member_1 area 3=1.759, member_2 area 2=0.782 etc., total mass respects limits.",
  "calculation": "Cross-check total mass: sum member lengths*area approx equals reported total mass 17.778. Max stress 9.3 < constraint 30, stresses balanced (-6.99 to 5.43 indicative of structure under balanced multi-axial load). To reduce stress further would require reducing load or major structural changes, currently no violates constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Given step-by-step optimization, this state best trade-off between mass and stress minimizing max stress while respecting constraints. Node_1, node_2 fixed. Node_3 fixed due to load. Node_4 optimally placed for best stress distribution.",
