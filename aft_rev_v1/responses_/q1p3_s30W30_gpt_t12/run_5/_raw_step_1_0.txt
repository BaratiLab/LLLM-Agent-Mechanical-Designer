Current max stress ~15.07 within ±30 allowed. Current total mass 14.904 < 30. Load applied at node_3, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Node_3 movable on x since fixed load placement, node_4 can move freely. Members size 2 area for all; consider resizing critical high-stress members.",\n\n  "analysis": "Stress is highest at member_1 (-15.07 negative, compression). Members closest to load (connected at node_3 and node_4) show moderate stresses around ±10. The structure forms a basic quadrilateral with diagonals. Moving node_4 can better align force flow. Possibly increase area of most stressed member and rebalance node_4 location to reduce high compression in member_1 and moderate tension in member_3.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 is too compressed; moving node_4 closer to node_3 may reduce length of highest stressed members. Increase area from 2(0.782) to maybe 3(1.759) for member_1 and member_3 to reduce stress. Members_2,4,5 can retain area 2 for mass savings. Node_4 currently at (3.5,3.5), can bring slightly lower y or shift x to shift triangular forces. Maintain closed truss, no node changes to load/support.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Reducing stress on member_1 (compression) can be done by decreasing its axial load or increasing area. Since load fixed at node_3, shifting node_4 closer to node_3 (x=2) and lowering y reduces moment arm and redistributes forces. Enlarging member_1 and member_3 cross section area reduces stress by increased capacity. Member areas chosen from table allowed to increase mass but remain below max. Members 2,4,5 unaltered for mass control. Closed truss kept by maintaining diagonals and four-node polygon.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate length of members with modified node_4: if node_4 = (3.1,2.7), recalculates lengths and mass. Recalculate member masses = length × area. Stress proportional inversely to area assumed. Total mass = sum of lengths×areas; expect increase but remain <30. Max stress expected to shrink from scaled area increase. Forces distributed more favorably with adjusted geometry. No load/support shifted.",\n\n  "calculation": "Set node_4 to (3.1, 2.7). Lengths: m1 = |(0,0)-(2,0)|=2, m3= sqrt((3.1)^2+(2.7)^2)= approx 4.101; adjust member_1 and member_3 area from 2 (0.782) to 3 (1.759). Member_1 mass = 2*1.759=3.518; member_3 mass=4.101*1.759=7.211, member_2=4*0.782=3.128 (length node_3-node_2=4), member_4=sqrt((6-3.1)^2+(0-2.7)^2)=3.8 approx, mass 3.8*0.782=2.97, member_5=sqrt((3.1-2)^2+(2.7-0)^2)=2.82*0.782=2.205; total mass ~3.518+7.211+3.128+2.97+2.205= approx 19.03 < 30 limit. This increases mass moderately but doubles cross-section area in critical members reducing max stress from -15.07 to near -7. To confirm max stress reduction consistent with area increase of ~2.25x, stress expected to drop proportionally if load roughly constant. Node_4 moved as above to advect forces and reduce bending moments. ",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Modified geometry and member areas maintain constraints with expected improved stress distribution.
