Node_4 y-position was increased to 2.8 in last step from 2.3 improving stress but stress on member_5 remains close to 9.6. Total mass near 19.4 with moderate area sizes (3 and 2). Areas are fixed by previous step. Optimization option: slight node_4 horizontal and vertical movement to balance axial forces, possibly shortening or tuning member_5 length to reduce max stress, within constraint to keep closed truss and load/support nodes fixed.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Check if reducing y of node_4 from 2.8 closer to 2.5 or moving x towards 2.5 helps decrease member_5 tension and max compressive stress.

Slight node_4 movement left/down may reduce load on member_5 or transfer stress evenly. Stresses in members_1 and 5 dominate.
