  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while staying within mass and stress constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress ~9.36 < 30 and total mass ~18.22 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_1 and Node_2 positions fixed, only node_4 movable.",
  
  "analysis": "The structure forms a closed 2D truss with 4 nodes. Max stress found primarily on member_5 (-9.3551) and member_1 (~-6.9). Mass margin present to possibly change cross-sectional areas or geometry. Node_4 controls upper part, affecting stress distribution in diagonals. Previous iterations show shifting node_4 vertically and horizontally near 2.6-3.0 x and 2.3-2.8 y. Slight movement of node_4 closer to the middle and slightly lower may reduce stress in member_5 by decreasing angle between top chord and diagonal.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Current areas mostly 3 for members from node_1, 2 for node_3 to node_2 and diagonals; trying to keep area pattern same for stability. Member_5 carries largest compressive stress (-9.36), close but safe. Potential horizontal shift node_4 left (~2.5-2.6) and drop vertical slightly (~2.3-2.4) to even loads and reduce compressive stress in member_5. Slight mass reduction possible by lowering areas but not yet needed as total mass is low.",
  
  "reasoning": "Move node_4 position slightly left and downward to balance compressive stresses better in diagonal (member_5) and top chords. This should alleviate peak compressive stresses without adding mass or changing member areas, respecting constraints. Keep member areas same. Node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed due to supports and load locations.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length and angle approximations for node_4 at (2.65, 2.45) vs potential (2.55, 2.3). Shorter diagonal length reduces member_5 compressive stress. Stress roughly proportional to force/cross-sectional area; geometry affects force distribution. Moving node_4 ~0.1-0.15 left and ~0.15 down expected to improve load path.",
  
  "calculation": "Proposed new node_4: x=2.55, y=2.30. Member areas unchanged. Estimated slight reduction in max stress from ~9.36 down to ~9.0 or below. Mass expected ~18.2, stress limits respected.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Design with node_4@(2.55,2.30), same member connections and areas. Anticipate stress reduction in diagonal and member_1. Constraints satisfied. Further improvements may be limited by fixed supports and load position. Can continue if desired, but approaching diminishing returns.",
