Stresses most critical in member_5 (-9.57), also members 1, 3, 4 are underutilized range. Node_4 moved closer from (3.5,3.5) to (2.8,2.3) reduced stresses and mass. Further refinement on node_4 position looking to reduce stress in member_5 and balance tension-compression.",\n  "analysis": "Current max stress is around 9.57 in member_5, slightly high compared to others. Node_4 placed relatively low and close to node_3 leads to member_5 length and force concentration. By slightly raising node_4 and slightly adjusting horizontal position, member_5 length and force direction can be balanced better to reduce max stress further. Load node_3 and fixed nodes 1,2 cannot be moved. Using same areas mostly okay since below 30 mass max. Possibly slight increase on areas inducing compression to offload tension members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try moving node_4 up from y=2.3 to near 2.8 and slightly right to x=3.0 might equalize forces more evenly. Monitor effect on mass and stress. Use same area configuration since it meets mass and stresses constraints. Confirm no member crosses or duplications.",\n  "reasoning": "Raising node_4 increases lengths of member_3,4,5 slightly but reduces force concentration in member_5, distributes stresses more evenly across structure. Smaller area members (like 2, area 0.782) connected to load already suffice. Members 1 and 3 with area_id 3 (1.759) balance light-avoid weight increase except if extreme stress are observed.
