Loaded node_3 (-10 at -45°), supports fixed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress member_5 (-9.2892) is still near 9.3 and seems critical. Member areas mostly fixed with member_1 and member_3 area 3, others mostly 2. Node_4 moved around in previous iterations within range (2.6, 2.55) to (3.5, 3.5) in history. Current position reduces stress from prior higher values. Further fine adjustment of node_4 can balance member forces to lower peak stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Members connected form a closed 4-noded truss with member_5 diagonal critical. Possibly shifting node_4 closer to node_3 vertically lower the stress on member_5 tension. Keep supports fixed: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Try reducing node_4\'s y from 2.55 slightly, x close to 2.6.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Lowering y of node_4 slightly reduces diagonal member_5 length and forces, while trying to maintain truss closure and stable load path. Member lengths and areas unchanged to avoid mass increase. Member_5 stresses are tension; slight geometric adjustment can reduce stress concentration. Areas remain the same: member_1 & 3 at 3, members 2,4,5 at 2 per input.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Estimate member lengths: node_4 at (2.55,2.4) range. member_5 length ∼ sqrt((2.0-2.6)^2 + (0-2.4)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.36+5.76) = sqrt(6.12) = 2.47, less than previous ~2.65. Reduced length => reduced stress for same force. Mass stays similar or slightly less.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Change node_4 to (2.65, 2.45) approx (x+0.05, y-0.1). Length member_5 shorter, expect stress reduction close to 8.8-9 range. Areas kept from iteration_6 unchanged: member_1(3), member_2(2), member_3(3), member_4(2), member_5(2).
