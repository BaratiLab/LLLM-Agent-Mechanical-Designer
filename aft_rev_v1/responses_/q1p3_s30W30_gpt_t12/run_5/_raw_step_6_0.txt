Adjusting node_4 to influence lengths and force distribution in members 3, 4, 5 may reduce stress. Current node_4 (2.75, 2.75) produces moderate stress; moving it slightly lower and closer to node_3 may lower tension/compression peaks. Avoid large member length increases to keep mass acceptable.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Shrink height y of node_4 from 2.75 to ~2.50-2.60; move x slightly left to reduce uneven load; maintain triangular geometry for stability and closed structure.",\n  "reasoning": "Reducing y and moving node_4 closer horizontally to node_3 reduces length and force in member_5 (which has highest compressive stress), potentially lowering stress there. Also balances forces in members 3 and 4. This movement keeps constraints satisfied without increasing mass significantly.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and areas based on node positions; select areas to ensure max stress < 30; total mass within limit.
