  "preamble": "Continuing optimization to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 9.6 < 30, total mass 19.4 < 30. Nodes fixed: node_1 and node_2. Load at node_3. Focus: optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress especially in member_5 (-9.6) and balance member area sizes.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_5 experiences highest compressive stress magnitude (-9.6017). Node_4 y-position was increased to 2.8 in last step from 2.3 improving stress but stress on member_5 remains close to 9.6. Total mass near 19.4 with moderate area sizes (3 and 2). Areas are fixed by previous step. Optimization option: slight node_4 horizontal and vertical movement to balance axial forces, possibly shortening or tuning member_5 length to reduce max stress, within constraint to keep closed truss and load/support nodes fixed.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Check if reducing y of node_4 from 2.8 closer to 2.5 or moving x towards 2.5 helps decrease member_5 tension and max compressive stress. Maintain edge connection (node_1, node_4) and (node_4, node_2). Minimum area of member_5 to stay at '2' to avoid mass increase.",
  
  "reasoning": "Node_4 controls internal triangle shape, affecting member_5 length and direction hence stress. Slight node_4 movement left/down may reduce load on member_5 or transfer stress evenly. Stresses in members_1 and 5 dominate. Ensuring all members balanced stress by nodal position adjustment recommended. Area sizes currently: member_1 area_id 3, member_2 area_id 2, member_3 area_id 3, member_4 area_id 2, member_5 area_id 2. Increasing areas will add mass, decreasing can invalidate member strength.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "member_1 length~3.6056 formula: node_1(0,0) to node_3(2,0) length=2 units? Actually 2 units. Area 3. Member_5 length calculation with coords node_3(2,0), node_4(3,2.8) length~sqrt(1^2 + 2.8^2)~2.95. Shorter length or less angle might reduce tension. Observe net length change when node_4 moves slightly towards node_3 or down.",
  
  "calculation": "Try node_4 = (2.85, 2.6) to shorten member_5 length slightly, reduce tension. Keep all area assignments as previous. Based on approximate trigonometry, decrease member_5 length: new length sqrt((2.85-2)^2 + (2.6 - 0)^2)=sqrt(0.7225 +6.76)=sqrt(7.4825)=2.736 less than 2.95. Expect reduced stress magnitude in member_5 and member_1 or member_3. Total mass impact minimal as areas unchanged. Verify new geometry keeps closed truss with same 5 members and connections. Check if y reduction reasonable and does not violate load support conditions.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New node_4 pos (2.85, 2.6) reduces length member_5 and tensile stress there. Areas unchanged to avoid mass increase. Expected max stress drops below 9.6. Will continue iterations if results improve. Load and support fixed nodes not changed. Geometry no duplication.",
