  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress is 9.37 < 30; total_mass 19.0452 < 30; nodes at load/support fixed; only node_4 movable.",
  "analysis": "Member_5 has highest absolute stress (~9.37). Adjusting node_4 to influence lengths and force distribution in members 3, 4, 5 may reduce stress. Current node_4 (2.75, 2.75) produces moderate stress; moving it slightly lower and closer to node_3 may lower tension/compression peaks. Avoid large member length increases to keep mass acceptable.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Shrink height y of node_4 from 2.75 to ~2.50-2.60; move x slightly left to reduce uneven load; maintain triangular geometry for stability and closed structure.",
  "reasoning": "Reducing y and moving node_4 closer horizontally to node_3 reduces length and force in member_5 (which has highest compressive stress), potentially lowering stress there. Also balances forces in members 3 and 4. This movement keeps constraints satisfied without increasing mass significantly.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and areas based on node positions; select areas to ensure max stress < 30; total mass within limit. Initial area choices retained as all are within constraints.",
  "calculation": "Propose new node_4 at (2.6, 2.55). Retain member connections and area choices. Recalculate member lengths and estimate stress relief due to geometry. Expect drop in max stress ~9.37 to ~8.5-9.0 post adjustment due to better load path and shorter most stressed member.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no support/load node moved; no duplicate connections; closed truss still formed; areas remain selected from given discrete set; total mass expected near previous but possibly slightly less due to some member shortening. Ready for next FEM evaluation.",
