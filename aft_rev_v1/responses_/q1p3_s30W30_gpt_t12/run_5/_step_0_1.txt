  "preamble": "Optimize truss minimizing stresses ≤ ±30, mass ≤ 30, with given nodes, loads and supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "3 nodes given (0,0), (6,0), (2,0); node_3 loaded -10 at -45°; supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller; need closed truss; areas discrete from 0:1 up to 10:19.548; min stress/mass; node positions fixed; add nodes if needed for closure while mass ≤30.",
  
  "analysis": "Initial structure line (x-axis) only; no closed loop; additional nodes needed to form closed truss; consider adding one or two nodes above line to form triangle(s); load at node_3 (middle) downward-left; compression/tension limited to ±30; mass depends on length×area sum ≤30; aim shorter members, minimal area consistent with stress; use truss principle: triangular units to carry load; supports at ends provide pinned/roller reaction; load direction at -45° implies vertical/horizontal component balance.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 above node_3 approximately at y~3 (mid span height) to form two triangles: nodes 1-3-4 and 4-3-2; members: 1-3, 3-2, 1-4, 4-2, 3-4 to close loop. Check lengths, areas. Areas high for tension/compression members, low otherwise. Check stress from load roughly considering axial forces; check mass from length×area sum ≤30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Form two triangles sharing node_3 and new node_4 high above x-axis. This closed truss better resists the eccentric load at node_3; load resolved into tension/compression in diagonals. Pinned and roller supports provide boundary reactions. Member length found by euclidean distance, stress estimated from force/area; force from static equilibrium simplified by resolving load into member axial forces using method of joints. Use minimum areas that keep axial stress ≤30 by adjusting areas accordingly.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: elastic members, axial only, negligible self-weight. Stress=Force/Area <=30. Calculate forces considering static equilibrium: sum forces x and y zero, sum moments zero about supports. Member length = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2). Use areas from discrete area set mapped by trial to acceptable stress from force. Mass=sum(length*area).",
  
  "calculation": "Positions: node_1(0.0,0.0), node_2(6.0,0.0), node_3(2.0,0.0), node_4(3.5,3.5). Distances: m_1_3=2, m_3_2=4, m_1_4=~5, m_4_2=~3.6, m_3_4=~3.9. Load at node_3: 10 N at -45°. Vertical & horizontal components = 10/sqrt(2)=7.07 N. Truss analysis shows member 1-3 in compression ~5 N, 3-4 in tension ~7N, 4-2 in compression ~7N approximately; others less force. To keep stresses ≤ 30, Area ≥ Force/Stress. For max force 7 → Area ≥ 7/30=0.233, pick area 1: 0.195 too low, so next 2:0.782 fits. Members with smaller forces can have lower area 0.195 or 1. Sum mass length×area checked: ~ (2×0.782)+(4×0.782)+(5×0.782)+(3.6×0.782)+(3.9×0.782)= about 14.1 < 30, mass OK.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Structure closed with 4 nodes and five members; stresses estimated below limits; mass below limit; no duplicates; nodes fixed for loaded and supports; one added with precise floats; areas chosen discretely from set balancing stress and mass; single iteration.",
