  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss with single load, pinned+roller supports, limit stress ±30, max mass 30",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load of 10N at node_3 downward-left demand bracing. Supports fixed at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Existing nodes at 0,0; 6,0; 2,0; 3,3. Max compressive stress exceeds limit on member_1 (-60 > -30). Need stress reduction by force path optimization & area selection.",

  "analysis": "Initial heavy compressive stress on member_1 from node_1 to node_3 means either member length or force concentration is high. Existing structure has node_3 fixed on baseline between supports with node_4 three units above. Asymmetric load (-10 N at 45°) causes high tension/compression. Current cross sections small (most area_id=1, area=0.195 or 2 area=0.782), may increase some areas or add members for better load distribution.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_3 is under tension 34, member_1 compression -60, consider increasing area on critical lines. Alternative is adding a diagonal member direct from loaded node to support or mid-brace to limit compressive peak. Limit total mass to 30 gives latitude for thicker members.",

  "proposal": "Proposal - retain original support and load nodes, add support node near node_3 higher location (e.g., node_5 at 2.5,1.5) to add diagonal members node_3-node_5, node_5-node_4 for load path via node_5. Increase crucial members (member_1, member_3) area to at least '3' (1.759) or '4' area. Members connecting base nodes (node_1, node_2) to node_4 can be kept at moderate areas. Increase member_5 area moderately to improve stiffness. Reconnect members for efficient force flow to limits.",

  "reasoning": "Adding a new lever arm (node_5) reduces compression by dividing load path. Increasing cross section area of critical compressive member (member_1) decreases stress level. Slight increase in mass acceptable (balance constraint < 30). Ensure no new eccentricities cause bending stresses. Original three-level triangular formation maintained for triangulation and stiffness.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Selected area sizes: member_1 area '4' (3.128), member_3 area '3' (1.759), member_5 area '2' (0.782). Node_5 placed strategically at (2.5,1.5), between node_3 and node_4 but below node_4 to reroute forces. Total length & mass estimated by sqrt(distance^2) * area factor summation to check <30.",

  "calculation": "Mass estimate: member_1 length ~2m * 3.128=6.256, member_2 length ~4m * 0.195=0.78, member_3 length ~3.162m * 1.759=5.56, member_4 length ~3.606m * 0.195=~0.7, member_5 length ~3.162m *0.782=2.475, member_6 (node_3-node_5) length ~1.58 *1.759=2.78, member_7(node_5-node_4) length ~1.58* 0.782=1.26, total ~19.8 < 30 constraint. Stress expected reduced in member_1 by area increase and rerouting.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Check no duplicate nodes. Load and support nodes fixed, only one new node at node_5 added. Members adjusted with new area sizes as area codes. No violation of constraints in mass or stress expected with design iteration. Ready for next FEM evaluation.",
