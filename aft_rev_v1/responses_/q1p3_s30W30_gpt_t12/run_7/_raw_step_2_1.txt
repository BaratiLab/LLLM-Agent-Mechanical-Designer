Mass below max. Structure closed with node_5 forms internal triangle improving load dispersion. Stress hotspots evenly distributed and low. Moving non-load/support node_5 marginally unlikely to improve much. Member areas balanced to support tension/compression.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress reduction from iteration 0 to 1 is significant. Mass increased due to area increase in member_1 and added members with adequate sections. Current geometry uses all members efficiently. Minimizing stresses further risks load path interruption or mass increase. High uncertainty that minor variations beat current design.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Load on node_3 directed diagonally down-left/-45°, nodes 1 and 2 fixed supports at base. Node_5 addition intra-truss redistributes forces and reduces max stress. Member areas (1 to 4) cover cross sections according to load demands. Stress magnitude safety margins remain sufficient. Mass budget not saturated, but reducing member areas risks stress increase beyond 30. Consequently design judged optimal under given Load and Constraints.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress limit ±30 Not exceeded even locally. Mass 21.82 << 30. Checked that node moves disallowed on load/support nodes (node_1, node_2, node_3). Non-support nodes optimized. If finer changes attempted could drop stress minutely but not significantly enough to justify more iterations. Rule compliance (no duplicate members/nodes, use of exact float node locations respected). Areas chosen pragmatically per loading demands. Member_4 stress near limit 17.09, close but stable.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Verified member lengths and areas reasonable: e.g., member_1(0-3) length ~ 2.0 m, area 4 corresponds to 3.128 sqm (from input areas), consistent contribution to mass 6.256. Stress multipliers checked vis-a-vis areas. Marginal stress and mass pass checks without excess. No improvements foreseen higher than this step while maintaining constraints. All node coordinates consistent.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints are adhered, minimal stress achieved with better than target safety margins. Load path strong and closed core truss configuration valid. Stopping now avoids overfitting and unnecessary complexity.
