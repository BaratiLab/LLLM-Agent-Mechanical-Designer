  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss with 3 given nodes under load, support, stress, and mass constraints in first iteration.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes: 3 points (0,0), (6,0), (2,0) on x-axis. Load at node_3 down-left. Supports: pinned node_1, roller node_2. Constraints: stress ±30, max mass=30 (sum length×area). Objective: closed truss, all nodes connected, no duplicates, minimal stress, sum areas chosen from discrete set.",
  
  "analysis": "Given only 3 nodes collinear, to form closed truss add an extra node above to create a triangle. Closed truss requires minimal additional node for stiffness and avoiding zero height structure. Add node_4 at midpoint (3.0, y>0). Load vector needing support against horizontal & vertical displacements. Triangular configuration disperses stresses. Select member areas starting from small values, increase based on estimated force/stress. Use truss static assumptions for axial forces with pin and roller supports.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 (3.0, h) above line. Member pairs: 1-3, 2-3 existing collinear horizontal with node_3 midpoint; add {1-4, 4-2, 4-3}, forming triangle plus web members. Calculate approximate member lengths and forces with load vector. Assign areas marginally to keep stress within bounds and mass under 30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Minimal nodes for closed truss >3 nodes, so node_4 is necessary bridge. Estimate forces via method of joints or sections approx: Load of -10 @ -45° on node_3 implies tension/compression in connected members. Geometry assures transfer of forces to supports. Choose areas to preserve stress ≤ 30 and mass ≤ 30. Member length from Euclidean distance. Areas from minimal set covering calculated force/length ratio s.t stress = force/(area) ≤ 30.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Method: Compute length L, force F from load and equilibrium (subset), approximate axial stress sigma = F/(A·area_unit), resolve A from sigma ≤ 30. Sum mass ≈ Σ L·A rejecting 0-area. Start areas from 0.195 values upwards as 1 is large. Force balance assumes pinned and roller supports constrain translation; uses tension-positive sign convention.",
  
  "calculation": "Lengths: 1-3: 2.0; 2-3: 4.0; 1-4: sqrt((3-0)^2 + (3-0)^2)= sqrt(9+9)=4.243; 2-4: sqrt((6-3)^2+ (0-3)^2)=4.243; 3-4: sqrt((3-2)^2+(3-0)^2)=sqrt(1+9)=3.162.\nLoad vector at node_3: magnitude 10, direction -45° => Fx=-7.07, Fy = -7.07\nEstimate axial forces assuming load carried by 1-3 and 2-3 and vertical 4. Numeric approx via equilibrium to distribute tension/compression:\nAssign member 1-3 tension ≈ 5; 2-3 tension ≈ 5; member 3-4 compression ≈ 7.0; members 1-4, 2-4 tension ≈ 3 each.\nChoose area 2 (0.782) for high force edges (3-4), area 1 (0.195) for low force members.\nCalculate max stress = Force/(Area) ≤ 30 check.\nStress 3-4: 7/0.782~8.95 <30 conservative.\nAggregate mass: sum(L×A)=(2×0.195)+(4×0.195)+(4.243×0.195)+(4.243×0.195)+(3.162×0.782)=0.39+0.78+0.828+0.828+2.47=5.3 <30 safe.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "All member stress within ±30 limit. Total mass 5.3 << 30. Truss closed and stable. Node 4 added for vertical stiffness. Existing nodes fixed. Areas chosen from allowed set meeting stress and mass constraints.",
