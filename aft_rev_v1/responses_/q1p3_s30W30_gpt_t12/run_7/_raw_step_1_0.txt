Supports fixed at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Existing nodes at 0,0; 6,0; 2,0; 3,3. Max compressive stress exceeds limit on member_1 (-60 > -30). Need stress reduction by force path optimization & area selection.",\n\n  "analysis": "Initial heavy compressive stress on member_1 from node_1 to node_3 means either member length or force concentration is high. Existing structure has node_3 fixed on baseline between supports with node_4 three units above. Asymmetric load (-10 N at 45°) causes high tension/compression. Current cross sections small (most area_id=1, area=0.195 or 2 area=0.782), may increase some areas or add members for better load distribution.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_3 is under tension 34, member_1 compression -60, consider increasing area on critical lines. Alternative is adding a diagonal member direct from loaded node to support or mid-brace to limit compressive peak. Limit total mass to 30 gives latitude for thicker members.",\n\n  "proposal": "Proposal - retain original support and load nodes, add support node near node_3 higher location (e.g., node_5 at 2.5,1.5) to add diagonal members node_3-node_5, node_5-node_4 for load path via node_5. Increase crucial members (member_1, member_3) area to at least \'3\' (1.759) or \'4\' area. Members connecting base nodes (node_1, node_2) to node_4 can be kept at moderate areas. Increase member_5 area moderately to improve stiffness. Reconnect members for efficient force flow to limits.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Adding a new lever arm (node_5) reduces compression by dividing load path. Increasing cross section area of critical compressive member (member_1) decreases stress level. Slight increase in mass acceptable (balance constraint < 30). Ensure no new eccentricities cause bending stresses. Original three-level triangular formation maintained for triangulation and stiffness.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Selected area sizes: member_1 area \'4\' (3.128), member_3 area \'3\' (1.759), member_5 area \'2\' (0.782).
