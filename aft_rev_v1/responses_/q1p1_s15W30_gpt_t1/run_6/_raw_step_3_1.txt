Loads at node_3 downward-left. Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Nodes 1,2,3 fixed; node_4 movable; members use varied areas with max stress issue on member_5.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High compressive stress (-37.63) on member_5 causes failure. Member_5 connects node_3 (load) to node_4. Reducing stress requires better load transfer and/or increasing cross-section area. Current members at node_3 carry large load causing stress concentration. Node_4 relatively high (3.0 to 3.6 m) and member_5 small area \'1\'. Previous designs placed node_4 lower with more members but higher mass. Need to balance mass and stress by redistributing load paths, possibly adding node(s) for alternative load paths. Current structure lacks redundancy.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding a new intermediate node near node_3 to split forces, or reposition node_4 closer to load path to reduce stresses. Increase area of high-stress members to reduce stress. Avoid unnecessary high area to keep mass low. Keep given load/support nodes fixed.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node_5 between node_3 and node_4 to redistribute force paths. Reposition node_4 slightly for better triangulation close to load point. Use area \'4\' for high stress members (member_5 and connecting members). Increase member_1 area to reduce stress near support. Form stable triangular structures with members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_3-node_4. Areas assigned to minimize mass but keep stresses ≤15.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangulation improves stiffness and load distribution. Adding node_5 splits load to reduce stress on critical member_5. Increasing area for highly stressed members reduces stress. Repositioning node_4 slightly toward node_3 shortens longest members and optimizes load path, lowering stress and mass. Keep other members low area to minimize mass. Using areas from catalog ensures standard sizing. Check sum member lengths×areas mass ≤30. Confirm max |stress| ≤15.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths, estimate max loads, stresses using approximate linear distribution. Lengths: node_3-node_5 and node_5-node_4 should be ~1.5-2.0m each. Area for critical members at \'4\' (3.128) reduces stress by factor over previous designs. Total mass sum should remain < 30.
