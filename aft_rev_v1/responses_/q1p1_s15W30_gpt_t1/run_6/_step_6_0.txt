  "preamble": "Current structure satisfies constraints with low stress.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 8.83 < 15, total mass 22.2 < 30; load and supports fixed; node_4 moved previously to optimize stress.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design is well balanced. Stress values are moderate, no overstressed members. Mass usage is efficient. Members with area 3 or 2 provide good stiffness to limit stress. No node repositioning allowed for load/support nodes; only node_4 moved. Additional nodes and members previously increased stress or mass or resulted in stress concentration.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding nodes introduced high stress concentrations (e.g. in iteration_4). Reducing complexity removed those. Current design consistent with constraints.",
  
  "reasoning": "Stress distribution is controlled by adequate areas (2 and 3) for members. Node_4 at (3.0,2.8) positioned to balance force paths from load at node_3 to supports at node_1 and node_2. Triangular shape with cross member (member_5) reduces bending moments. Mass inside limits. No significant benefit observed from adding members or nodes due to diminishing returns or increased stress in past attempts.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas yield total mass ~22.2. Max stress well below limits. Tensile and compressive stresses distributed among members avoiding overstress. No members close to stress limit Â±15.",
  
  "calculation": "Mass and stresses confirmed from FEM results. Areas selected from given set, members sized for stresses. Node_4 position optimized to lower max stress from previous higher values (over 30 or 50) to below 9. Further node movement limited by constraints and previous analysis. Mass well below 30.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "No violation of constraints. No further stress reduction achievable without increasing mass above limits or violating load/support or nodal position constraints. Optimization is near optimal.",
