  "preamble": "Optimized truss for downward-left diagonal load at node_3 with pinned and roller supports at nodes 1 and 2.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max stress ±15, max mass ≤30. Load: -10 N at -45° on node_3. Supports fixed at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Current design's max stress violations at members 7 and 8 (large compressive stress). Mass under limit but stress far exceeded. Objective: reduce stress peaks, balance load paths, keep mass under 30.",

  "analysis": "High compressive stress in members between node_3 and node_5 and node_5 and node_4 due to direct diagonal load path and small cross sections (area 1). Members closer to supports have adequate cross sections but are longer. Multiple short members with small area cause stress spikes. Excessive member count and insufficient bracing cause load path concentration on fewer members.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing nodes connected to node_3 while adding a triangular truss configuration to distribute loads better. Increase area of heavily loaded members, shorten length by optimizing intermediate node placement. Remove less effective members (e.g., from node_5) to lower stress concentrations. Move node_4 slightly to balance geometry and allow better load distribution.",

  "proposal": "Maintain nodes_1,2,3 fixed. Remove nodes_5 and 6 to reduce complexity. Shift node_4 to (3.0, 2.8) slightly lower for better triangle geometry. Establish members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4. Use area ids such that members connected to node_3 have larger cross section area 3 for strength, and other members area 2 for balance. This reduces member count, focuses load paths and controls stress.",
 
  "reasoning": "A simple 4 node triangular truss with diagonal load is proven efficient. By removing nodes_5 and 6, we avoid small low-area members with high stress. Increasing area of node_3 connected members reduces stress due to larger inertia. Shifting node_4 down slightly reduces length of node_3-node_4 member, decreasing bending and stress. Keeping minimal members reduces redundant load paths and unnecessary mass.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: 1-3 = 2.0m, 3-2 = 4.0m, 1-4 = sqrt(3^2 + 2.8^2)=4.106m, 2-4= sqrt(3^2 + 2.8^2)=4.106m, 3-4 = sqrt(1^2 + 2.8^2)=2.924m. Assign areas: members from node_3 as area 3 (1.759), others area 2 (0.782). Estimate mass sum ~2*4.106*0.782 + 2*2*1.759 + 2.924*1.759 = ~3.2+7.036+5.14=~15.38 total mass, well within 30. Stress reduced by larger cross-section and geometry.",

  "calculation": "Total mass = member lengths * area (cross-section) sum = ~15.38 (within 30). Max stress reduced due to larger section member_1, member_2, member_5 (renamed), likely below ±15 given improved load paths and reduced length. Members with area >1 increase strength. Simpler truss leads to better force distribution. No member expected overstress now.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Check no duplicate nodes/members. Supports unchanged. Load on node_3 handled by 3 members: to node_1, node_2, node_4. Areas chosen for strength and mass balance. Node_4 position optimized for triangle aspect ratio around 60° which is efficient. Ready for verification and FEM analysis.",
