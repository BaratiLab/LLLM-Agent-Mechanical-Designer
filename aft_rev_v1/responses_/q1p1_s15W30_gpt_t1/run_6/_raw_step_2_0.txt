Stress limits ±15, max mass 30. Current mass 31.8 exceeds limit. Current max stress 9.17 acceptable. Need to reduce mass and keep stress ≤15.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current structure uses 5 nodes (3 fixed, 2 added). Mass is too high (31.8 > 30) due mainly to large area in member_6 (area_id 4) with long length causing 12.5 mass. Stress mostly low, so reduce areas and possibly remove redundant members. Adding node_5 did not help mass. Need better geometry and area distribution.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Suggestion: Remove node_5 to reduce members and mass; make structure simpler with triangular bracing. Use smaller areas on less stressed members. Move node_4 slightly upward to balance forces. Adjust member areas 1~3. Check lengths and recalc masses accordingly.",\n\n  "proposal": "Propose 4-node truss: keep node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), and node_4 raised to (3.0,3.6) to improve rigidity. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4. Reduce member areas: mostly area_id 1 (0.195) or 2 (0.782) for efficiency and lower mass. This yields lower mass <30 and stresses <15.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Using fewer members reduces complexity and mass. Raising node_4 optimizes load path to supports. Using low cross-section areas for members with low stress saves mass. Triangular geometry ensures stability and good load transfer. Member lengths calculated precisely for mass estimate. Load direction at node_3 transferred efficiently via node_4 bracing.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Areas picked: members with compression or tension near limits get area_id 2 (0.782), others area_id 1 (0.195). Lengths calculated using distance formula. Mass for each member = length * area (assuming unit density). Total mass <30. Max stress expected <15 based on FEM analogy with reduced member size.",\n\n  "calculation": "Node distances (approx): n1-n3=2.0m, n3-n2=4.0m, n1-n4=√(3²+3.6²)=4.692m, n2-n4=√(3²+3.6²)=4.692m, n3-n4=√(1²+3.6²)=3.758m. Member masses with areas: m1 (n1-n3): 2.0*0.782=1.564, m2 (n3-n2): 4.0*0.195=0.78, m3 (n1-n4): 4.692*0.782=3.67, m4 (n2-n4):4.692*0.782=3.67, m5 (n3-n4):3.758*0.195=0.733. Total mass ~10.4 <30.
