  "preamble": "Resolving member over-stress and mass constraints in 2D truss under single node load with pinned and roller supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max ±15 stress, max 30 mass. Current max stress 34.19 (member_3), mass 20.7 acceptable but stress fails. Load at node_3 (-10N at -45°). Supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. Current nodes: 5 including load/supports.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_3 from node_1 to node_4 overshoots tensile stress maximum (34.19 > 15). Members with small areas cause stress to spike. Geometry creates long members with high stress concentrations. Increasing cross-section areas raises mass; must balance carefully. Adding bracing nodes near load to better distribute forces is beneficial. Current design uses too thin area (area_id '1' = 0.195) at critical member_3, but increasing area there risks mass budget. Node_5 added previously but member_3 still overstressed. Member_5 and member_6 show zero stress — possibly inefficient. Node_4 placed at (3,3) may be too far laterally; repositioning can reduce load arm and tension. Member_7 has compressive stress -9.5 within limits.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Idea: Move node_4 slightly more above node_3 and between node_1 and node_2 to reduce lever arm. Add another intermediate node (node_6) between node_3 and node_4 or close horizontally under node_4 to create triangular triangulation and reduce load on member_3. Redistribute areas: increase critical compressive members, keep others minimal. Remove or reduce zero-stress members that do not help force path. Select areas from catalog. Use precise floating node positions to ensure load paths and stress reduction.",
  
  "proposal": "Add node_6 at (3.0, 2.5) below node_4 to create subdivided truss near load. Reconnect members: (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), (node_1-node_4), (node_2-node_4), (node_3-node_6), (node_6-node_4), (node_3-node_5), (node_5-node_4). Adjust member areas: larger around critical tension/compression paths (area 2 or 3), smaller in others (area 1 or 0). Remove member_7 (node_3-node_4 with large smaller area causing stress concentration), redistribute load through node_6 and node_5.",
  
  "reasoning": "Triangulation distributes forces better, reduces max stress. Node_6 added to relieve tension in member_3, avoiding direct long span node_1-node_4 tension. Member areas adjusted to limit stress within ±15MPa threshold. Areas chosen to balance mass and strength. Maintaining load and supports fixed preserves boundary conditions. Member lengths and loading considered for stress estimates. Reduced long thin members and redundant members that had zero stress to optimize mass. Precise node vertical spacing ensures force path continuity and structural stiffness.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Using tensile/compressive stress = Force / (Area × member length). Member length calculated by Euclidean distance. Applied load is 10N at 45° upward-left (-10, -45°). Member stresses balanced by geometry and areas. Mass ~ sum(length × area density) must be <=30.",
  
  "calculation": "Node positions: node_4 at (3.0, 3.25), node_5 at (2.5, 2.0) unchanged, node_6 at (3.0, 2.5). Calculate member lengths: e.g., node_3-node_6 ~ distance between (2.0,0.0) and (3.0,2.5) = sqrt(1^2 + 2.5^2) ≈ 2.69. Adjust cross-section areas: critical tension members area_id '2' or '3' (0.78 to 1.759), less stressed members '1' (0.195). Estimated total mass ~22-25 within budget. Estimated max stress below ±15MPa by spreading load paths and adding bracing nodes.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify new design meets stress ≤15MPa and mass ≤30. Check no duplicate nodes/members. Supports and loads unchanged. Use member area catalog strictly. Geometry optimized to reduce stress concentration and enhance load transfer via shorter, triangulated members.",
