Stress values are moderate, no overstressed members. Mass usage is efficient. Members with area 3 or 2 provide good stiffness to limit stress. No node repositioning allowed for load/support nodes; only node_4 moved. Additional nodes and members previously increased stress or mass or resulted in stress concentration.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding nodes introduced high stress concentrations (e.g. in iteration_4). Reducing complexity removed those. Current design consistent with constraints.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Stress distribution is controlled by adequate areas (2 and 3) for members. Node_4 at (3.0,2.8) positioned to balance force paths from load at node_3 to supports at node_1 and node_2. Triangular shape with cross member (member_5) reduces bending moments. Mass inside limits. No significant benefit observed from adding members or nodes due to diminishing returns or increased stress in past attempts.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas yield total mass ~22.2. Max stress well below limits. Tensile and compressive stresses distributed among members avoiding overstress. No members close to stress limit Â±15.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Mass and stresses confirmed from FEM results. Areas selected from given set, members sized for stresses.
