Load is -10N at 45° on node_3. Current design violates stresses (max ±15 required, current up to 261) though mass is within limit (22.7 ≤ 30). Need to reduce peak compressive and tensile stresses by reconfiguring members and areas.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High compressive stress (-261) on member_5 (node_4-node_5) and high compressive stress (-222) on member_7 (node_2-node_4) shows these members are overloaded. Member areas 1 and 1 are too small for the load. Also member_6 has tensile stress around 58 which is too high. Adding node_5 in upper region increased stress concentration. The bottom chord comprised of nodes node_1, node_3, node_2 is lightly connected. Current triangular shape with added vertical and diagonal members created stress hotspots. To reduce stresses, redistribute load paths, strengthen critical members and possibly remove or reposition node_5 to avoid weak joints.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "1) Consider removing node_5 or relocating it to balance forces.\\n2) Form two main triangles for load path to support node_3 load.\\n3) Adjust member cross-section areas focusing on compressive members.\\n4) Maintain minimal mass by limiting largest areas.\\n5) Ensure no members bear >15 absolute stress.\\n6) Maintain 3 support nodes with load at node_3.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_5 to reduce complexity and stress concentration. Use a four-node truss: nodes at node_1 (support), node_2 (support), node_3 (load), node_4 (upper). Connect as a classic Warren truss with members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2 (base), node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2 (top chord), node_3-node_4 (diagonal tie). Size members for stress ≤±15 and mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Eliminating node_5 reduces member count and complexity. Typical Warren truss geometry distributes loads well. Members node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2 form the bottom chord, node_1-node_4 and node_4-node_2 the top chord, and node_3-node_4 the diagonal brace transferring load to supports. Areas chosen based on load paths: highest areas for compressive members, moderate for tension. Minimal member lengths reduce mass. Members near load get slightly higher areas to keep stresses low but total mass under 30.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths from coordinates. Use cross-section area from provided discrete set to achieve stress ≤15, roughly estimating axial forces from load and geometry, then choosing an area to keep stress = force/(area) ≤15.
