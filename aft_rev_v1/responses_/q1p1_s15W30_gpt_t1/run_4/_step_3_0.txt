  "preamble": "Current truss meets constraints with low stress and acceptable mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress is 14.21 < 15, mass is 23.76 < 30. Load and supports fixed. Node_4 moved previously for better geometry.",
  
  "analysis": "The current 4-node, 5-member truss is well balanced: max stress < limit and total mass comfortably below max allowed. All members have reasonable stress distribution with no member near mass or stress limits. Load at node_3 and supports fixed. Nodal positions except support/load nodes constrained. The triangle formed is relatively optimal.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus was on stress reduction by adjusting nodal positions in previous steps and choosing member areas following stress levels. No over-stressed members remain; no mass limit reached. Member cross-sections correspond well with their internal forces.",
  
  "reasoning": "Further node movement is limited due to load/support node fixity and the already low max stress. Larger member areas would increase mass unnecessarily. Smaller areas may raise stresses beyond limits. Current geometric layout is efficient with direct load transfer paths and no redundant members. Hence, minimal stress configuration achieved given constraints and load/support conditions.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress optimized by keeping node_4 at 3.0,3.5 while node_3 fixed at 2.0,0.0. Area selections match stress magnitudes. Mass well within limit. Member lengths and truss geometry yield no improvement with minor node moves given fixed nodes at extremes.",
  
  "calculation": "Member lengths: m1 ~2.236, m2 ~4.301, m3 ~4.0, m4 ~3.5, m5 ~3.201 units. Areas: m1=0.782, m2=1.759, m3=0.782, m4=1.759, m5=0.782. Resulting member masses sum to 23.7557 < 30. Max stress 14.21 < 15. Load applied raises compressive in m1 but constrained. Attempted node_4 moves reduce geometry by fractional increments worsen stress or mass.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "No further changes feasible within constraints and fixities. Current solution optimal balancing stress and mass. Stopping iterations recommended.",
