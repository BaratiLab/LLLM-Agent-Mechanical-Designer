Triangles are stable and allow load transfer with reduced stress. Add one node (node_4) vertically to create two triangular panels: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_3-node_2-node_4. This provides closure and load paths.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding node_4 at approximate y, calculate member lengths and assign areas from given table to keep stress ≤15 and total mass ≤30.

Equilibrium of node_3 with forces in members node_3-node_1, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_4. Assign areas: high load members assigned area_id 3 (1.759), others smaller. Estimate axial forces via method of joints. Approximate forces: node_3-node_4 tension~10N, node_3-node_1 compression ~5N, node_3-node_2 compression ~5N. Check stress: force/area ≤15 → area≥ force/15. For highest force 10N, area≥0.6667. Choose area_id 3 (1.759) to be safe. Calculate mass: sum length×area with chosen areas, ensure ≤30.
