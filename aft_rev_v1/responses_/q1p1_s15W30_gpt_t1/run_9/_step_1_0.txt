  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss for load at node_3 with given supports and constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress Â±15, max mass 30. Current max stress 29.05 > 15, mass 20.64 < 30. Need to reduce stress by geometry change or member sizing.",
  
  "analysis": "Original member_3 extremely overstressed (29.05). It's a compression/tension member from node_1 to node_4, length 3.0. Area 1 corresponds to 0.195 mass factor, the smallest cross section. Low area causes high stress. Increasing area may increase mass above 30. Adding intermediate nodes or changing topology can reduce stress. Members connected to loaded node_3 are low area but stress is low. The main issue is member_3 length or inclination causing overload.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try moving node_4 higher (to increase vertical component), potentially add another node between node_4 and node_3 to reduce member_3 length and share load. Possibly reduce area of other members to compensate mass increase. Remove or relocate member_6 (node_2 to node_1) that seems redundant and small force. Use higher area for critical tensile members, reduce areas elsewhere.",
  
  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (4.0, 2.0) between node_3 and node_4 to shorten long member_3 and create a more load-distributing truss. Connect members: node_1-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_3-node_5. Remove member_6 (node_2-node_1) to save mass. Adjust areas to meet stress limits, mostly area 3 or 4 for critical tension members, area 1 or 2 for compression links with lower stress.",
  
  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 creates a triangular sub-truss, redistributing load more evenly, reducing stress on member_3. Removing member_6 reduces mass. Increasing area for members with high stress reduces stress but can increase massâ€”balance required. For members in tension or compression at moderate stress, select medium area. Compressive member_3 in the previous design was too small area; breaking it into shorter members with better angle reduces axial load and stress. Geometry change with new node keeps supports and loads fixed, satisfying instructions.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Compute member lengths: node_1-node_5: sqrt((4-0)^2+(2-0)^2)=4.472, node_5-node_4: sqrt((2-4)^2+(3-2)^2)=2.236, node_3-node_5: sqrt((4-2)^2+(2-0)^2)=2.828. Approximate member lengths for mass estimate. Remove node_2-node_1 member. Sum new masses comparing with previous total 20.64 to keep under 30.",
  
  "calculation": "Assign areas: node_1-node_3: area 2 (0.782), node_3-node_2: area 2, node_1-node_5: area 3 (1.759), node_5-node_4: area 3, node_3-node_5: area 3, node_4-node_2: area 3. Member lengths from coordinates. Mass roughly length * area factor sum around 18-25. Expected stresses under 15 with revised geometry and areas.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate member or nodes, supports and loads fixed. Confirm areas selected from given set. Node coordinates precise floats, updated topology improves stress distribution, mass under constraint. Expected to meet design goals.",
