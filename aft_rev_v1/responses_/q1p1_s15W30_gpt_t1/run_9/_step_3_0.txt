  "preamble": "Optimal stress and mass achieved within constraints for given 2D truss.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 10.86 < 15 allowed, total mass 24.93 < 30 mass limit. No violations in stress or mass.",
  "analysis": "Stress reduced significantly in iteration 2 compared to previous. All members remain within Â±15 stress. Mass comfortably below max. Load and supports fixed; nodal movement restricted to non-load, non-support nodes.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Efforts to decrease mass further risk increased stress; members with zero stresses indicate potential for slight cross-section downsizing but risk on stability. Node 6 placed effectively to distribute forces.",
  "reasoning": "Structure balances compressive and tensile forces well. Member areas correlate with stress requirements. Node 6's position at (3.0, 4.0) yields minimal max stress with the current member layout. Further node repositioning likely yields diminishing returns due to nonlinear effects and load/support restrictions.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member masses and stresses indicate area selections consistent. Attempting to reduce areas on members with 0 stress risks buckling or load transfer issues. Moving node_6 slightly may increase stress beyond limits or mass beyond target.",
  "calculation": "Max stress 10.86 < 15, total mass 24.9253 < 30. Stress in critical members decreased from 29.05 and 21.14 prior iterations to 10.86 now. Member masses balanced to support loads without excess.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met, mass and stress optimal given load/support. Current design likely converged to global/local optimum. Proceed to stop optimization.",
