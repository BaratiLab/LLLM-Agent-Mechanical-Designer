  "preamble": "Optimize a closed 2D truss with given nodes, loads, and supports minimizing stress and mass under constraints.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Three given nodes: node_1(0,0) pinned, node_2(6,0) roller, node_3(2,0) loaded with -10N at -45°. Max stress ±15, max mass ≤30. Must form a closed truss with no new nodes altering given positions.",

  "analysis": "Current nodes lie collinearly on x-axis, so to form a closed truss must add a new node above or below to form triangles. Triangles are stable and allow load transfer with reduced stress. Add one node (node_4) vertically to create two triangular panels: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_3-node_2-node_4. This provides closure and load paths.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding node_4 at approximate y, calculate member lengths and assign areas from given table to keep stress ≤15 and total mass ≤30. Use static equilibrium, axial force = load components / sin or cos of member angles, approximate. Assume uniform material and unit modulus.",
  
  "reasoning": "Load on node_3 is downward left at 45°, so members from node_3 to node_4 and to node_1 and node_2 will carry components of this load. Larger area members needed on highest force members. Stress = axial force / area ≤15. Mass = sum(length × area). Choose minimal sufficient areas to satisfy stress constraints and keep mass ≤30.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_3 =2, node_3-node_2=4, node_1-node_4 and node_3-node_4 unknown (depends on y coordinate). Choose node_4 as (2.0, 3.0) for simplicity: forming right triangles. Lengths: node_3-node_4 =3, node_1-node_4 approx sqrt( (2)^2 +3^2)=3.605. Also node_4-node_2 sqrt( (6-2)^2 + 3^2)=5.0. Members: node_1-node_3 (2), node_3-node_2 (4), node_1-node_4 (3.605), node_3-node_4 (3), node_4-node_2 (5), and node_2-node_1 (6) to close the bottom chord. Use node_2-node_1 bottom chord to close truss. Total 6 members.",
  
  "calculation": "Load at node_3 = magnitude 10N at -45°, components Fx=-7.07N, Fy=-7.07N. Equilibrium of node_3 with forces in members node_3-node_1, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_4. Assign areas: high load members assigned area_id 3 (1.759), others smaller. Estimate axial forces via method of joints. Approximate forces: node_3-node_4 tension~10N, node_3-node_1 compression ~5N, node_3-node_2 compression ~5N. Check stress: force/area ≤15 → area≥ force/15. For highest force 10N, area≥0.6667. Choose area_id 3 (1.759) to be safe. Calculate mass: sum length×area with chosen areas, ensure ≤30. Sum approx (2×0.782)+(4×0.782)+(3.605×0.195)+(3×1.759)+(5×1.759)+(6×0.195)=1.564+3.128+0.703+5.277+8.795+1.17=20.63 <30. Mass constraint met. Stress constraint met by area choice.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Structure closed by adding node_4 at (2.0, 3.0). 6 members connecting nodes forming two triangle panels plus bottom chord for closure. Area sizes chosen to keep stresses under 15 and total mass under 30. Supports and load unchanged. Positions precise float. No duplicate members or nodes.",
