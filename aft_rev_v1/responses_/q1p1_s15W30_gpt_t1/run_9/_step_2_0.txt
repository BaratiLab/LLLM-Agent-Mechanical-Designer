    "preamble": "Optimization of truss to meet max stress ±15 and mass ≤ 30.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Load applied at node_3 (-10@-45deg), supports at node_1(pinned) and node_2(roller). Existing design exceeds compressive stress and max mass.",
    
    "analysis": "Current max compressive stress at member_1 (-21.14) > 15 limit. Total mass 30.26 slightly exceeds max allowed mass 30. Areas currently mostly '3' (1.759) cause higher stress in key tension/compression members. Member_3 notably heavy (7.8665 mass). Structural layout causes force concentration around node_3. Node_5 added in iteration 1 increased complexity and mass but didn’t reduce max stress below limit.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "Need to reduce compressive stress on member_1 and reduce overall mass. Reducing area on highly stressed members or redistributing forces by changing geometry or adding nodes. Load and supports fixed; modify intermediate nodes to redistribute forces. Consider adding one more node to create more triangulation and better load path. Remove unnecessary heavy members. Use smaller cross-sections where possible within stress limits.",

    "proposal": "Add one additional node higher and slightly shifted at around (3.0, 4.0). Remove node_5 to reduce heavy diagonal members. Connect nodes as triangle framework between supports and load node_3 with new node. Adjust member areas to reduce overstress and mass while maintaining load path. Design members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-new_node, new_node-node_4, new_node-node_3, node_4-node_2. Use areas mostly 2 or 3 except highly stressed members using 4 with length considerations. Expect mass reduction below 30 and max stress within ±15.",

    "reasoning": "1. Avoid excessive length heavy members by removing node_5. 2. Add node to improve force flow above load node for load transfer and reduce large compressive stress on member_1. 3. Keep basic horizontal base nodes same due to supports. 4. Use areas judiciously to balance stress and mass. 5. Triangulation ensures structural stability. 6. Smaller members on less stressed members to reduce mass. 7. Compound geometry will reduce stress concentration at key members.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths for new connections using coordinates. Assign areas to limit max stress ≤15 accounting tensile and compressive. Estimate mass by length × area factor. Total mass ≤30 check. Max stress validate by expected force paths and reduced areas/lower member length.",
