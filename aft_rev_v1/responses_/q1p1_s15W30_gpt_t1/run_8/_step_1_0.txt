  "preamble": "Current truss meets constraints but max stress is close to limit. Optimize node_4 to reduce max stress and total mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress at member_1 (-12.487) is near ±15 limit. Total mass 27.29 below 30 max. Load at node_3 down-left at 45°. Supports fixed. Can only move node_4 (free node). Members adjacent to node_4 have highest mass and stresses are moderate.",
  "analysis": "Moving node_4 horizontally closer to node_3 can reduce tension in inclined members (member_3, 4, 5). Slightly lowering node_4 y-coordinate may reduce axial forces due to load path. Reducing member area in highly stressed members can lower mass but risk stress increase; better to adjust geometry first. Members 3,4,5 area=3 is large; consider reducing area if stress lowers sufficiently. Member 1 stress near limit indicates stress path improvement needed.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_4 moved from (2.0,3.5) to approx (2.5,3.2) to shorten member_3 and member_5 length and balance forces. Check length changes: member_3 from node_1(0,0) to node_4(2.5,3.2) length ~4.09, shorter than 3.5 vertical. Member_1 and 2 unchanged. Predicted stress decrease in member_1 due to load redistribution. Keep member areas same initially.",
  "reasoning": "Shifting node_4 right and slightly down brings load closer to member_2 and reduces bending moment at node_3, possibly lowering max compressive stress at member_1. Shorter length members means member forces more direct in axial direction, improving stress distribution. Retain closed truss shape. No change to load or supports allowed. Avoid duplicate members/nodes.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate new lengths: member_3 length sqrt((2.5-0)^2 + (3.2-0)^2)=4.09 < previous 3.5 vertical? Previous was 3.5 exactly (vertical). Actually 3.5 length before, now ~4.09 longer; reconsider y lowering more. Try y=3.0: length ~3.9 still longer; balance position at (2.3,3.1) length ~3.77 reducing length to reduce mass and force. Areas unchanged. Member_1 length 2.0 m. Member_4 length sqrt((2.3-2)^2 + (3.1-0)^2)=3.1 < previous ~3.5. Member_5 length sqrt((6-2.3)^2 + (0-3.1)^2) ~4.85 shorter previous ~4.03; longer, reconsider position closer to node_2 horizontally. Final position approx (2.3,3.1) balanced.",
  "calculation": "New node_4 position: (2.3,3.1). Members unchanged connections and areas. Expect slight stress redistribution lowering member_1 max compressive stress from -12.49 closer to -10. Mass still under 30. Stress and mass checks to be performed post step.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New optimized structure with node_4 moved to (2.3,3.1), same member connections and areas. Anticipate staying within constraints with reduced max stress. Stop condition false - further optimization steps possible.",
