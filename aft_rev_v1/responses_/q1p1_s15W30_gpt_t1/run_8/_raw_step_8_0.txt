Nodes at supports and load fixed. Node_4 moved slightly upward to 2.68, slight stress improvement.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has stress well below limit; however, member_1 compressive stress is highest (~-6.38). Areas mostly mid range (area_id 2 or 3). Mass is well under constraint, allowing potential area reduction or node position adjustment. Since load/support nodes fixed, only node_4 to tweak. Member lengths and angles influence stress; node_4 vertical position increase improved stress marginally.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing high compression on member_1 (-6.38). Possibly lower area of member_1 or shift node_4 horizontally slightly to optimize force distribution. Cannot reduce area of member_1 below 3 currently assigned; lower areas 2 or 1 possible to reduce mass but must check stress impact.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Lowering area in high compressive members may increase stress, so better to adjust node_4 position for more favorable geometry. Moving node_4 slightly to the right and down may reduce compression in member_1 and balance forces in members 4 and 5. Maintaining closed truss shape and connectivity mandatory. Area assignments mostly optimal given stress balance. Given current progress over 7 iterations with marginal gains, perform one positional tweak to try reduce stress further before stopping.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member_1 length: from (0,0) to (2,0) = 2 units. Node_4 currently at (2.36, 2.68). Consider shifting node_4 slightly right (2.4) and down (2.5) to reduce compression in member_1 and balance tension in others.",\n  \n  "calculation": "New node_4: (2.4, 2.5). Members areas unchanged. Estimated member lengths close to before but with adjusted geometry for lower compression in member_1. Expected max stress decrease by ~0.1-0.2 from 6.38 due to favorable geometry. Total mass remains about the same, still under 30. Stress constraints still met. Mass constraint met. Closed truss maintained.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_1 and node_2 fixed for supports, load at node_3 fixed. Only node_4 moved. Member areas unchanged for now due to balanced stress state and mass margin. Further optimization may yield diminishing returns.
