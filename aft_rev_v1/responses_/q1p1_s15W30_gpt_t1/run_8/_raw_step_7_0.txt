Current max stress ~6.42 with total mass ~21.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure shows balanced compressive and tensile stresses mostly between -6.4 to +5.2 with mass well below limit (20.99 < 30). Node_4 movement mostly affects stress distribution in members connecting node_4. Earlier iterations indicate raising node_4 beyond ~2.65m decreased stress, but beyond ~2.6-2.65m no significant improvement with current area selection. Member areas are already optimized to some extent.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Shifting node_4 vertically between 2.6 and 2.7 may allow stress redistribution; small horizontal adjustments within small range might further balance compression/tension. Areas appear set, so geometry refinement is next step.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Since load and support nodes are fixed, optimize node_4 position vertically and slightly horizontally to reduce max stress. Slightly increasing height of node_4 may increase axial force in members, reducing bending or shear demand, thus lowering peak stresses. Horizontal adjustments will slightly rebalance axial forces. Maintain member areas as member_1 and member_3 use area_id 3 (1.759), members_2 and 5 use 2 (0.782), member_4 area 3 (1.759) to keep mass in check.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Current max compressive stress: member_1 ~-6.42, tensile max: member_5 ~5.17. Change node_4 from (2.35, 2.62) to try (2.36, 2.68) to spread load paths, improve axial load sharing. Use precise float values.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node_4 move horizontally by +0.01m, vertically +0.06m.
