  "preamble": "Optimize truss node 4 location to reduce max stress and stay within mass limit.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 6.49 < 15 limit, total_mass 20.7551 < 30 mass limit. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_4 coordinates moved from previous iterations to reduce stress and mass. Areas selected mostly area 3 and 2.",
  
  "analysis": "Member stresses max at member_1 (-6.49), which is compression; others lower. Increasing height reduces compressive stress in bottom chord (member_1). Decreasing height reduces stress in diagonal and top chords but may increase bottom chord stress. Current node_4 at (2.35, 2.55). Perturbing node_4 vertically by +/-0.1 to find improved stress distribution. Note that increasing vertical height can reduce axial force in bottom chord by increasing lever arm. Check if small increase in height lowers max stress further without adding too much mass.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try node_4 at (2.35, 2.65) and (2.35, 2.45). Keep members areas same: member_1 area_id 3; member_2 area_id 2; member_3 and member_4 area_id 3; member_5 area_id 2. Estimate mass change minimal due to small coordinate change. Expect stress redistribution; if max stress reduces below 6.49 and total_mass < 25, accept. Otherwise, test lateral (x) perturbations around 2.35 such as 2.30 or 2.40.",
  
  "reasoning": "Increasing height of node_4 marginally can reduce compressive forces on bottom chord by transferring more load into diagonals and tension members. This optimizes axial force distribution, potentially lowering peak stress, keeping total mass stable. Avoid decreasing height as it previously increased max stress. Lateral shifts smaller effect but can help balance forces. Areas selection is optimal as bigger areas for high force members keep stress low; don't increase areas to avoid mass penalty.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Equations: Member axial force ~ load and geometry; Stress = force / area. Areas fixed; mass = length × area × density (assumed constant). Node_4 vertical move changes member lengths and force directions: longer diagonals absorb load better. Check length at (2.35, 2.65): member_3 length ~√(2.35² + 2.65²) ≈ 3.54, slightly longer. Member_4 length ~√((2.35-2)² + 2.65²) ≈ 2.67, also longer than current. Mass increase is length change × area. Small increase acceptable.",
  
  "calculation": "Move node_4 to (2.35, 2.65) from (2.35, 2.55). Member connections same. Keep areas: member_1=3, member_2=2, member_3=3, member_4=3, member_5=2. Expected: slight reduction in compressive stress of member_1; stress redistribution may lower max stress to ~5.5-6.0. Mass slightly increases but stays below 25. If max stress and mass within limits, accept the improvement and continue optimization. Otherwise, revert.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "New coordinates: node_1=(0.0,0.0), node_2=(6.0,0.0), node_3=(2.0,0.0), node_4=(2.35,2.65). Members unchanged. Areas unchanged. Stress expected below previous max 6.49. Mass within 30. Continue optimization until max stress approaches minimum or improvements negligible.",
