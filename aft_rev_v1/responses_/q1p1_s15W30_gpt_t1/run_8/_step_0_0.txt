    "preamble": "Optimize a closed truss with 3 existing nodes, loaded at node_3, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller), stress and mass constraints applied.",

    "scratch_pad_1": "Given three nodes aligned on x-axis: node_1 (0,0), node_3 (2,0), node_2 (6,0). Load -10 units at 45° down-left on node_3. Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Need closed truss—must add at least one node and members to form triangles. Max stress ±15, max mass 30. Areas discrete values from given table. Minimize stress and mass.",

    "analysis": "The existing nodes are colinear, so the truss is not stable if members only connect these nodes. To create a stable closed truss, add one node above the beam to form triangles. A fourth node above node_3 vertically would create two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_3, node_4, node_2). This configuration disperses load and creates a closed shape. Use areas balancing mass and stress. Member lengths and areas determine mass; areas determine stress capacity. Calculate approximate axial forces using static equilibrium and truss method assumptions (pin-jointed, axial forces only). Approximate mass by sum(length × area).",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2.0, h), h chosen to balance mass and stiffness. Estimate h around 3-4 to avoid excessive member length. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2 (base), node_1-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_2-node_4 (sides). The structure is then closed with 5 members. Select areas from table to ensure stress ≤ ±15, mass ≤ 30. Start with small area for base members (short, less stress), larger for inclined members (carry load), iterate areas.",

    "reasoning": "Closed truss requires at least one additional node above beam to create triangles. Support constraints fix node_1 and node_2. The load on node_3 at -45° causes combined tensile/compressive stresses in members. Assumed linear elastic axial force distribution. Calculate member forces by resolving load at node_3 and static equilibrium. Area chosen to keep stress = axial force / area ≤ 15. Mass sum(length × area) ≤ 30. Choose precise node coordinates and areas accordingly.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Members only carry axial load; pin joints. Use equilibrium at node_3: sum vertical and horizontal forces zero. Calculate member lengths geometrically. Use stress = axial_force / (area), axial_force estimated from load and geometry. Use area units from given set. Member length in units from coordinates. Sum mass = Σ length*area ≤30. Aim for minimum total area to reduce mass and stress. Trial h=3.5.",

    "calculation": "Place node_4 at (2.0, 3.5). Member lengths: base members: node_1-node_3 = 2.0 units, node_3-node_2 = 4.0 units. Side members: node_1-node_4 = sqrt(0² + 3.5² + (2.0)²) = sqrt(4 + 12.25) = sqrt(16.25) ≈4.0311, node_3-node_4 = 3.5 units, node_2-node_4 = sqrt((6-2)² + (0-3.5)²) = sqrt(16 + 12.25) = sqrt(28.25) ≈5.3166. Total lengths: base 6.0, sides 12.8477. Load at node_3: -10 at -45° → Fx = -10*cos45° ≈ -7.071, Fy= -10*sin45° ≈ -7.071. Equilibrium at node_3 considers members node_1-node_3 (horizontal), node_3-node_2 (horizontal), node_3-node_4 (inclined). Resolve forces at node_3: horizontal sum zero, vertical sum zero. Solve for member forces (F13, F32, F34). Approximate with symmetry and member orientation: node_3-node_4 carries vertical load component; node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2 carry horizontal parts. Choose area: base members (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2) area 2 (0.782) each, gives capacity stress*area = 15*0.782=11.73 force capacity > Fx 7.071. Inclined members: area 5 (4.887) each for sides to carry vertical load (7.071). Check mass: 2 bases × 2.0 & 4.0 × 0.782 = (2*0.782)+(4*0.782) =1.564+3.128=4.692. Sides mass: (4.0311 + 3.5 + 5.3166) × 4.887 ≈ 12.8477×4.887=62.8 (exceeds 30). Reduce inclined areas to 1 (0.195): mass sides ≈12.8477×0.195=2.505. But stress likely too high. Area 3 (1.759): 12.8477×1.759=22.6 total mass (4.692+22.6=27.3) under 30. Check stress: max force 7.071/1.759=4.02 << 15 → acceptable. So choose areas 2 (0.782) for base, 3 (1.759) for sides. Total mass ~ 27.3 < 30; Max stress ~4.02 <15. Closed, connected.",

Members: base node_1-node_3 (area 2), node_3-node_2 (area 2), sides node_1-node_4 (area 3), node_3-node_4 (area 3), node_2-node_4 (area 3). Total mass ~27.3 < 30; max stress ~4.02 < 15; closed truss; nodes connected; no duplicates; obey constraints; support and load fixed.",
