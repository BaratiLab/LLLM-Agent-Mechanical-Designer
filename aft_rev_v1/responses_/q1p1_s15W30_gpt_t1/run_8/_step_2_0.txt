  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position, adjust areas to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 13.51 close to limit 15, total mass 25.45 under 30. All loads and supports fixed, only node_4 movable.",
  
  "analysis": "Max compressive stress is at member_1 (-13.51) which is close to -15 allowed. Members connected to node_4 have areas 3, causing relatively high mass and moderate stresses. Node_4 shifted slightly from (2.0, 3.5) to (2.3, 3.1) reduced mass and changed stresses, but max stress rose. Reduction in member area for members with low stress (2.0865 and 3.337) possible to save mass and redistribute stress.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reposition node_4 closer to center between node_1 and node_2 to balance truss forces and reduce max stress. Reduce areas of member_5 and member_3 from 3 to 2 or 1 to reduce mass and stress. Increase area of members carrying high compression (member_1) to ensure stress transfer at lower actual stress if needed.",
  
  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 slightly down and right will reduce elongation in members connected to node_4, lowering stress. Smaller areas on members with low stress tolerance unused. Larger area at member_1 with highest negative stress may reduce stress magnitude by increasing capacity. Using area indices 2 and 1 as possible. Maintaining closed truss with current nodes and connections. Total mass target below 30 to allow increase of some areas while decreasing others.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths needed for mass calc and stress effect estimation:\nmember_1: length sqrt((2.0-0.0)^2+0^2)=2.0\nmember_2: length sqrt((6.0-2.0)^2+0^2)=4.0\nmember_3: length sqrt((2.3-0)^2+(3.1-0)^2)=approx3.8\nmember_4: length sqrt((2.3-2.0)^2+(3.1-3.1)^2)=approx0.3\nmember_5: length sqrt((6.0-2.3)^2+(0-3.1)^2)=approx4.98\n\nCalculate mass and reassess max stress heuristically.",
  
  "calculation": "Adjust node_4 to (2.25, 2.9) to reduce member lengths and rebalance stresses.\nSet member_1 area to '3' (1.759) to increase capacity for compressive stress.\nSet member_3 and member_4 area to '2' (0.782) to reduce mass and stress where lower forces observed.\nKeep member_2 at '2' and member_5 at '2' for mass saving.\nCalculate approximate mass:\nmember_1: 2.0*1.759=3.518\nmember_2: 4.0*0.782=3.128\nmember_3: 3.68*0.782=2.88\nmember_4: 0.3*0.782=0.234\nmember_5: 4.98*0.782=3.9\nTotal approx mass=13.66 < 25.45 previous, good for stress capacity increase.\nExpect max stresses drop below current 13.5 due to balance and capacity increase.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Modification respects constraints. Node_4 within movable region, load and supports fixed. Closed 2D truss maintained: nodes 1,2,3,4 connected as before. Areas updated reducing mass and stress. No duplicate nodes or members. Ready for next iteration to check FEM results.",
