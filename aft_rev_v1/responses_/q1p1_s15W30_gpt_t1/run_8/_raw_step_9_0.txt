Load at node_3, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_4 repositioned in recent iterations.",\n  "analysis": "All stresses are well below allowable limits with a margin. Mass is comfortably below maximum. Small oscillations in node_4 position suggest local minimum reached. Areas chosen balance stress and mass effectively.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further minor adjustments to node_4 likely yield negligible improvements. Structural topology and areas are stable and consistent. Load and support positions fixed, limiting reconfiguration options.",\n  "reasoning": "Given constraints, max stress and mass constraints are met with good margins. Moving node_4 slightly in past iterations optimized stress distribution. Adding members or changing support/load nodes restricted. Current design exhibits balanced tension-compression distribution and efficient use of material.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Area assignments: member_1,3,4 with area id \'3\' (1.759), member_2,5 with area id \'2\' (0.782).
