  "preamble": "Optimize the 2D truss node_4 position to further reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "The structure currently meets constraints; max stress is 6.49 < 15, total mass 20.97 < 30. Areas mostly area_id 2 and 3. Load on node_3, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_4 moved downward and slightly right from prior step, reducing max member stress significantly from ~9 to ~6.5.",

  "analysis": "Load is applied at node_3 away from supports at nodes 1 and 2. Maximum compressive stress is on member_1 (-6.49); members with high stresses are members_1, 5 (5.15), and 4 (-4.07). Member_3 has moderate tensile (3.65). Current node_4 position is (2.4, 2.6). Previous iterations showed that lowering node_4 and adjusting x shifted stress lower significantly. The configuration is stable with no constraint violation. Member areas on members_1, 3, and 4 are set to area_id 3 (1.759 cross-sectional area units), members_2 and 5 to area_id 2 (0.782 units). Mass increased from iteration_2 to iteration_3 due to increased member_3 and 4 areas from 2 to 3.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Lowering node_4 reduced max stress from 9.08 to 6.49 and moved stress from member_4 to member_1. Member_1 stress is compressive and close to critical but well under limit. Member_5 tensile stress increased but still below limit. Consider defining a new node_4 coordinate that balances member lengths for stress reduction and possibly reduces total mass slightly (by letting some areas downscale). The only movable node except load/support nodes is node_4.",

  "reasoning": "To further reduce max stress, we can adjust node_4 to optimize force flow. Moving node_4 slightly left to reduce tensile stresses on member_5 and compressive stress on member_1, while keeping vertical position above node_3 to maintain stiffness. A slight horizontal shift (~2.3 to 2.35) and slight downward movement (~2.5 to 2.55) may better balance stress distribution. Area selection: keep members_1,3,4 at area_id 3 for stiffness, members_2,5 at area_id 2. This keeps mass under limit and improves stress envelope. If stress drops further, consider reducing area of member_3 or 4 to area_id 2.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths recalculated with node_4 candidate positions; stress roughly inversely proportional to length for axial members and cross-sectional area. Current max mass 20.97 < 30, so area increase possible if beneficial but we prioritize reducing stress. Use areas from 2 or 3 to keep mass moderate. Ensure no member stress goes beyond ±15. Note that reducing node_4 height too much reduces stiffness, increasing stresses. Aim to keep node_4 y around 2.5-2.6 and x between 2.3-2.4.",

  "calculation": "Try node_4 at (2.35, 2.55): member lengths (approx): 'node_1-node_4' ~ sqrt(2.35²+2.55²)=3.47, 'node_3-node_4' ~ sqrt((2.35-2)²+2.55²)=2.57, 'node_2-node_4' ~ sqrt((6-2.35)²+2.55²)=4.46. Member masses then recalculated. Stress expected to reduce on member_1 and member_5 due to more favorable length ratio. Keeping member areas same as iteration_3 yields mass ~20.0 (estimate) and max stress ~5.5 (estimate).",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Move node_4 slightly left and down to (2.35, 2.55), keep member areas same as iteration_3. This maintains closed truss, respects load/support constraints, mass <30, and reduces max stress further. Stop condition not met as optimization can still improve.",
