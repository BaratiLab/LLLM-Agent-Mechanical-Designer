  "preamble": "Current 4-node truss design satisfies constraints with low max stress and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress ~6.6 < 15, total mass ~20.6 < 30. Load at node_3, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_4 repositioned in recent iterations.",
  "analysis": "All stresses are well below allowable limits with a margin. Mass is comfortably below maximum. Small oscillations in node_4 position suggest local minimum reached. Areas chosen balance stress and mass effectively.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further minor adjustments to node_4 likely yield negligible improvements. Structural topology and areas are stable and consistent. Load and support positions fixed, limiting reconfiguration options.",
  "reasoning": "Given constraints, max stress and mass constraints are met with good margins. Moving node_4 slightly in past iterations optimized stress distribution. Adding members or changing support/load nodes restricted. Current design exhibits balanced tension-compression distribution and efficient use of material.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Area assignments: member_1,3,4 with area id '3' (1.759), member_2,5 with area id '2' (0.782). Member lengths and orientations consistent with member stresses. Member masses correspond to selected areas and lengths, summing correctly.",
  "calculation": "Max compressive stress -6.5927, max tensile 5.2842 well below Â±15 limit, total_mass 20.6228 < 30. Node_4 at (2.4, 2.5) is optimal for load transfer to minimize max stress. Minor position perturbations previously increased max stress or mass. No constraint violations.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Current node positions and member areas optimized for stress minimization. Further attempts to reduce stress lead to marginal gains or violate constraints. Stop optimization now as design is stable and optimal within problem space.",
