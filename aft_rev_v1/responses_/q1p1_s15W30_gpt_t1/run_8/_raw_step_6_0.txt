Node_4 moved upwards from 2.55 to 2.65 increased mass/stress slightly.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure is stable and within constraints but max stress member_1 and member_5 are higher and close to 6.4. Minor improvement possible by adjusting node_4 y-coordinate to balance force paths and reduce peak stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member areas seem proper (3 for node_1 to node_3 and node_4 connections, 2 for node_3 to node_2 and node_2 to node_4). Load and supports fixed. Only node_4 can move.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Lowering node_4 slightly from 2.65 to ~2.5-2.55 previously decreased max stress and mass. But we saw loss in mass and slight rise in stress before. Aim for fine tuning node_4 vertical position around 2.6 to 2.65 for stress reduction. Also length changes affect mass differerntly for each member due to area. Keeping area consistent but adjusting length for better force distribution preferred. This reduces peak compressive and tensile stresses.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member length formulas, stress = force/area approximation, total mass = sum(length*area*density). Areas fixed. Evaluate lengths for varying y of node_4 in 2.55-2.65 range to minimize peak stress ~6.4 while total mass <= 30.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Set node_4 y=2.62 (midpoint of last two). Using Pythagoras to estimate member lengths and influence on stress, small reduction in length for member_1 and member_3 possible, reducing stress. Member_5 length will be slightly longer but area is smaller. Expect total mass ~20.9, max stress ~6.3 < 6.4 currently.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 = (2.35, 2.62) likely to reduce peak stresses while mass remains below 21.1, max stress under limit 15.
