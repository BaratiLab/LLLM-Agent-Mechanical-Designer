Area sizes mostly small. Node_1 and node_2 fixed at supports, node_3 fixed for load. Node_4 moved from previous iterations to reduce stresses significantly. Members mostly area 2 or 3.",\n  "analysis": "Reducing max stress further can be done by adjusting geometry to balance tension and compression and reasonable increase of cross-section area where stresses high but not max out mass. Member_4 has max compressive stress -9.08. Member_3 tension 7.63 and member_1 compression -6.1. Geometry suggests node_4 could be slightly moved to reduce eccentricity and stress concentrations. Current structure is light, so slight area increases on highly stressed members may help. Keep structure closed with 5 members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing most tensile and compressive stresses by shifting node_4 lower along y-axis and slightly to right to better triangulate load path. Increase areas on members 3 and 4 to reduce stress. Keep total mass <=30 and max stress <15.",\n  "reasoning": "Node 4 repositioning can rebalance force flows. Moving node_4 slightly right and slightly down from (2.25, 2.9) to around (2.4, 2.6) can reduce member_4 compression and member_3 tension. Choosing member_4 and member_3 areas to \'3\' or \'4\' from \'2\' to reduce stress. Member_1 area kept at \'3\' as stress already moderate. Member_5 area can remain at \'2\'. Member_2 area kept small at \'2\' due to low stress. Total mass remains under limit.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and approximate stresses changes: Member_4 length from node_3 (2,0) to node_4 roughly sqrt( (2.4-2)^2 + (2.6-0)^2 ) = sqrt(0.16 + 6.76)= sqrt(6.92)= 2.63. Member mass proportional to length x area. Increasing area from \'2\' (0.782) to \'3\' (1.759) doubles area, mass impact roughly 2.63* (1.759-0.782)=2.63*0.977=2.57 more mass added here but total mass still under 30. Similar for member_3 from node_1(0,0) to node_4(2.4,2.6) length=sqrt(2.4^2 + 2.6^2)= sqrt(5.76 + 6.76)=sqrt(12.52)=3.54, increasing area from \'2\' to \'3\' increases mass by 3.54*0.977=3.45 approximately. Total mass increment ~6.0 keeps total ~21.5, below limit.",\n  "calculation": "New node_4: (2.4, 2.6). member_1: [\'node_1\', \'node_3\', \'3\']. member_2: [\'node_3\', \'node_2\', \'2\']. member_3: [\'node_1\', \'node_4\', \'3\']. member_4: [\'node_3\', \'node_4\', \'3\']. member_5: [\'node_2\', \'node_4\', \'2\']. Estimated max stress reduces from 9.08 to ~7.5 by geometry and area increase. Total mass ~21.5 < 30. All all constraints met. Nodes and connections unique. Supports and load nodes fixed.
