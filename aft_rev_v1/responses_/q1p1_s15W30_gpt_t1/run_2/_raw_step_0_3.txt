Keep given nodes fixed.",\n\n  "analysis": "Structure has 3 nodes in a line: node_1 at origin, node_2 at (6,0), node_3 at (2,0). Load acts diagonally at node_3. To form a closed truss, add a node above the line to create a triangle (closed). New node_4 at (2.5, 3.0) approx reasonable height for stiffness and reduced length. Members: (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), (node_1-node_2), (node_1-node_4), (node_3-node_4), (node_2-node_4). Triangular shape distributes load effectively reducing member stress. ",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Potential stress concentrations on horizontal members node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2; diagonal members with new node_4 carry tension/compression. Choose smaller areas on longer horizontal members and larger areas on diagonals to balance mass. Calculate member lengths and estimate section area from stress and force assumptions.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Assumptions: Truss members only axial forces, linear elastic. Load vector decomposed into components Fx= -10*cos(45°)= -7.07N, Fy= -10*sin(45°)= -7.07N downward-left at node_3. Supports: node_1 pinned (restrain both axes), node_2 roller (allow horizontal movement). Reaction forces calculated by static equilibrium; internal forces assigned approximate based on geometry and applied loads. Members\' axial forces limited by ±15 stress units, thus area = force/stress ≤ max_area. Mass from length×area summed ≤30. Prioritize area on load-carrying members and minimize on others.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: L(node_1-node_3)=2.0, L(node_3-node_2)=4.0, L(node_1-node_2)=6.0, L(node_1-node_4)=sqrt((2.5)^2 + 3^2)=3.905, L(node_3-node_4)=sqrt((0.5)^2 + 3^2)=3.041, L(node_2-node_4)=sqrt((3.5)^2 + 3^2)=4.609. Assign areas based on required forces. Use area from discrete set by rounding up calculated areas to nearest discrete available.",\n\n  "calculation": "Estimate internal forces from static equilibrium simplifies to: horizontal bottom chords tensile/compressive ~7 N, diagonals ~5-8 N distributed. Approximate max required area: area = force / max_stress = max force/15. Max force ~8N => area ~0.53. Choose nearest higher area from set: 0.782 (index 2). Assign areas: horizontal extremes (bottom chords): 0.195 (index 1) smaller force, diagonals 0.782 (index 2). Calculate mass=sum(length×area): (2.0*0.195)+(4.0*0.195)+(6.0*0.195)+(3.905*0.782)+(3.041*0.782)+(4.609*0.782)=0.39+0.78+1.17+3.05+2.38+3.60=11.4<30 feasible.
