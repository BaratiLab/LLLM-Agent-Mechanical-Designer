Current max stress 42.31 > 15, mass 11.377 < 30. Need to reduce member stress mainly in member_1.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Existing structure uses nodes 1,2,3 on base line and node_4 as top node. Large compressive stress in member_1 (node_1-node_3) indicates member_1 is heavily loaded. Members 4-6 have larger cross-sections (area 2 → 0.782) increasing mass. Member_3 close to stress limit (-14). Member arrangement is a triangle on right side connected to the base. Load at middle bottom node_3 causes high compression in left bottom member_1. Need to redistribute load more evenly and add structural stiffness to reduce stress concentration.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding a higher node above node_3 to reduce compression in member_1 by creating a symmetrical truss, possibly a Warren or Pratt-like truss with verticals and diagonals. Move load node_3 fixed, keep supports fixed. Adjust areas to lower stresses. Possibly reduce area in members with low stress and increase in high stress. Avoid member redundancy.",\n\n    "proposal": "Add a new node above node_3 at approx (2.0,4.0). Connect node_1, node_2 to new node_5, connect node_3 to node_5 forming a triangular upper section to reduce compressive load in member_1. Also connect node_5 to node_4 at (2.5,3.0) to form a secondary load path. Remove or reduce area of overloaded members accordingly. Adjust areas to balance stresses while keeping mass under 30.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Raising a node above load point provides an alternative load path to reduce compression on member_1. Additional triangles increase stability. Using lower-area members in low-stress members reduces mass; increasing area in highly stressed members avoids exceeding allowable stress. Keep members connected to support nodes to ensure boundary conditions are respected. Overall truss shape remains simple and effective for given constraints.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths of members needed for mass: use distance formula. Calculate member stress roughly assuming axial load redistribution. Use area choices from given discrete list to limit stresses below 15.

Approximate required area inversely proportional to expected stress to keep within limits.",\n\n    "calculation": "Node coordinates: \\nnode_1 = (0.0, 0.0), node_2 = (6.0, 0.0), node_3 = (2.0, 0.0), node_4 = (2.5, 3.0), node_5 = (2.0, 4.0)\\n\\nMember lengths:\\n- member_1 (1-3): 2.0\\n- member_2 (3-2): 4.0\\n- member_3 (1-2): 6.0\\n- member_4 (1-4): sqrt(2.5^2 + 3.0^2)=3.905\\n- member_5 (3-4): sqrt(0.5^2 + 3.0^2)=3.041\\n- member_6 (2-4): sqrt(3.5^2 + 3.0^2)=4.609\\n- new members:\\n  member_7 (1-5): 4.0\\n  member_8 (2-5): 4.472\\n  member_9 (3-5): 4.0\\n  member_10(4-5): 1.0\\n\\nAssign areas:\\n- Highly stressed members (1,3) area increased to 2 (0.782) or 3 (1.759)\\n- Low stress members area 1 (0.195)\\n- Members with new load path medium area to balance\\n\\nCheck mass ~ sum(length × area).
