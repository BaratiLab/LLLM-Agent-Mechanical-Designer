  "preamble": "Current structure meets constraints but max stress is near limit; refine geometry to reduce peak stress.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max stress ±15, mass ≤30. Current max stress ~14.28 close to limit. Mass 14.3 well under limit. Load at node_3, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_3 and nodes_1,2 fixed position; node_4 can be moved slightly to optimize stress distribution.",

  "analysis": "The highest magnitude stress is compressive in member_1 (-14.28), which is close to max allowable 15. Members with lower stress suggest potential to redistribute forces by adjusting node_4 position, increasing or decreasing height and lateral location. Area sizes for members are uniform at '2', mid-range. Current mass is well below max mass, so small area increase might be possible for critical members if needed. Member_1 is shortest (node_1 to node_3 horizontal 2m); stress high likely due to load at node_3. Adjusting node_4 slightly forward and up could reduce bending effects and lower stress in member_1.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_4 slightly right and up (e.g. x = 2.9 to 3.1, y = 3.28 to 3.5) to better triangulate the load path and reduce member_1 stress. Keep areas same for now to minimize mass. Member_5 under compression (-9.34), might rise slightly but still under limit. Keep member connectivity same for closed truss integrity.",

  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 too far right risks increasing member length and mass; moving too far vertically can increase stress in vertical members. Slight lateral shift towards node_2 will distribute forces better across members 3,4,5, reducing stress concentration in member_1. Areas remain as '2' to keep mass low; focus on geometry optimization. If max stress remains close to limit, consider increasing area of member_1 slightly next iteration, but for now geometry first.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Length of member_1 currently approx 2.0m; moving node_4 right for better load path triangulation reduces bending moment at node_3. Member_5 length changes slightly with node_4 movement but stress expected to redistribute favorably. Mass recalculated after node move: should not exceed 30 given current '2' area (0.782).",

  "calculation": "Move node_4 from (2.85, 3.28) to (3.05, 3.45). Verify member lengths and approximate stress effect. Member_1 length still ~2.0. Member_3 length increases slightly but acceptable. Mass approx remains ~14.3. Max stress expected to drop below 14 based on improved triangulation of forces.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "New node_4: (3.05, 3.45). Members unchanged with area '2'. Structure remains closed. Mass and stress within constraints. Keep 4 iterations left for further refinement if needed.",
