  "preamble": "Optimize node4 position to reduce max compressive stress while keeping mass under limit.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current structure close to constraints; max stress -12.85 < ±15; mass 14.52 << 30 constraint; nodes for load/support fixed.",
  
  "analysis": "Max compressive stress on member_1 is high (-12.85). This member is between node_1(0,0) and node_3(2,0). Its area id is '2' (0.782). Move node_4 to modify load paths and reduce stress on member_1 without increasing mass beyond 30. All members currently use area id '2'.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 stress is highest magnitude; consider moving node_4 closer to line between node_1 and node_3 to relieve member_1 compressive load. Keep node_4's y coordinate reasonably high to maintain structural integrity; try reducing x from 2.15 to ~1.9.",
  
  "reasoning": "Shorter member lengths generally reduce mass but may increase stresses. Node_4 displacement should redistribute forces to members_3,4,5. Member areas are uniform, so force redistribution affects stresses. Slightly reduce node_4 x-coordinate to reduce compression in member_1 and check stress impact experimentally. Maintain constraints and compare to current max stress and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Move node_4 x from 2.15 to ~1.9, y from 3.4 to ~3.5; will shorten length of member_3 (node_1-node_4) and lengthen member_5 (node_3-node_4), potentially lowering compression on member_1. Calculate new lengths and estimate masses (area*length).",
  
  "calculation": "Length changes:\nmember_3: dist from (0,0) to (1.9,3.5) = sqrt(1.9^2 + 3.5^2) ≈ 3.97\nmember_5: dist from (2,0) to (1.9,3.5) ≈ sqrt(0.1^2 + 3.5^2) ≈ 3.50\nmember_1 unchanged length 2.0\nMember masses updated:\nmass_member_3 = 3.97 * 0.782 = 3.10\nmass_member_5 = 3.50 * 0.782 = 2.74\nCompare to previous masses member_3:3.15, member_5:2.66\nExpected slight decrease in mass for member_3, increase for member_5.\nTotal mass ~14.5 again, near current but potentially less stress on member_1.\nExpect max stress < 12.85, hopefully ~12.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New node_4 at (1.9, 3.5), keep members and area indices unchanged at '2'. Anticipate improved max stress. If stress reduction is small after FEA, try small y increase. Current design not yet optimal due to high compression in member_1.\nNo duplicate nodes or members. Supports and loads unchanged.\nStop only if stress improvement saturates near current min.\nOutput updated node_dict, member_dict, stop=False.",
