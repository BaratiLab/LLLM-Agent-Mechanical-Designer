  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress below 15 while keeping mass under 30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max stress Â±15, mass <=30. Current max stress ~14.37 near limit; total mass 14.66 << 30. Load at node_3 fixed; supports at nodes 1, 2 fixed. Only node_4 movable. Area for members fixed at '2'.",
  
  "analysis": "Max compressive stress near allowable limit on member_1 (-14.37). Member_3 tension at 8.05 and member_5 compression at -9.45 moderate. Mass well below limit, so cross section area can remain the same or be optimized if needed. Slight adjustment of node_4 upward and slightly left could redistribute forces, lowering max stress. The triangular geometry controls load path; changing node_4 affects member angles and force distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Since mass constraint not tight, focus on stress reduction by geometry change. Move node_4 to reduce compressive force in member_1, possibly by increasing height and shifting left. Need to keep structure closed with 5 members, no duplicate members or nodes, and keep boundary nodes fixed (node_1,2,3).",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_1 max compression suggests load transfer at node_3 is high; shifting node_4 closer horizontally to node_1 reduces member_1 length and improves load sharing. Also increasing height slightly increases triangle area, reducing forces per member. Relaxing member force magnitudes lessens max stress. Selected cross section '2' (0.782 area) for balance between mass and strength; no change needed now.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Check distances: node_1 (0,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (~3.05,3.45). Propose new node_4 roughly (2.9,3.6) to move left and up by ~0.15 horizontally and ~0.15 vertically. Lengths member_1,3,5 recalculated and expected to reduce peak stress on member_1. Member forces should balance load better.",
  
  "calculation": "New node_4 = (2.9, 3.6)\nLength member_1 = dist((0,0),(2,0))=2.0 (fixed)\nLength member_3 = dist((0,0),(2.9,3.6))=sqrt(2.9^2+3.6^2)=4.60\nLength member_5 = dist((2,0),(2.9,3.6))=sqrt(0.9^2+3.6^2)=3.73\nExpect redistribution: member_1 compression reduces from -14.37 closer to -13; member_5 compression may increase but still within limits; member_3 tension mildly increased but < 10.\nMass calculated with area '2' (0.782): Total length sum * 0.782 should remain ~14.7 (acceptable).\nNo cross section changes; geometry adjustment only.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New geometry expected to maintain mass constraints and reduce max stress below 15. Will continue optimization in next steps if stress near 15 after FEM. Stop now is premature as small geometric changes still possible.",
