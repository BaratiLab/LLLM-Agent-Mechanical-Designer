Load at node_3; supports fixed at nodes 1 and 2; only node_4 can move. Areas consistent at \'2\' for all members.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max compressive stress on member_1 at -12.81 is the highest stress. Member lengths influence stress distribution. Node_4 controls triangle height and affects member stresses member_3, member_4, member_5. Increasing height slightly reduces compressive stress, but too large height risks mass and stability.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_4 at (2.25, 3.6). Past steps show lowering max stress near iterations 8-10 by slight lowering or raising node_4\'s y coordinate. Member areas fixed at \'2\', area 0.782. All members contribute to mass about 15 units. Member_1 shortest length, but highest stress. Try small adjustment of node_4 y to reduce peak stress.",\n\n  "reasoning": "To reduce max stress from 12.81, adjust node_4 vertically slightly to rebalance force paths. Moving node_4 slightly left and slightly lower can reduce tension in top chords and compressive force on member_1. Length and areas kept constant to control mass. No area changes to avoid complexity. Small step to explore improvement.", \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4 moved from (2.25, 3.6) to (2.15, 3.4). Expected: Reduce peak compressive stress on member_1 by reducing geometry asymmetry. Member masses recalculated with same areas; total mass roughly similar ~ 14.9.",\n\n  "calculation": "New node_4 length calculations approx: member_3 length: sqrt((2.15-0)^2 + (3.4-0)^2) = ~3.91, close to previous. Member_1 length: 2.0 (fixed). Slight reduction in y causes member_5 length to decrease slightly, lowering tensile stress there. Overall mass stable, stress redistributed with max stress estimated < 12.81, closer to 12.5 expected.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Changes retain all constraints: max stress < 15, total mass < 30.
