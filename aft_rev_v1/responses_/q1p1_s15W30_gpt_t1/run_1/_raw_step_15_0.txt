Current design well under mass and stress limits. Load at node_3, support at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Only node_4 movable. Member areas fixed at \'2\'.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress (12.55) and total mass (14.45) are below constraints, showing good margin. Member_1 has highest compression stress (-12.55). Minor adjustments moving node_4 to vary geometry have not significantly reduced stress. Areas are uniform at 0.782, maintaining mass efficiency.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Existing geometry and uniform area choice appear near optimal. Further node_4 moves oscillate max stress around 12.5–13 without improvement. Mass also stable. No member areas reduced to further lower stress without re-analysis.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Given load and boundary conditions, compressive stress in member_1 reflects major load path. Moving node_4 slightly away from optimal height/position increased stress previously. Uniform areas strike balance between mass and structural demand. Minor moves have limited effect indicating local minimum reached.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress ≈12.55 < max 15; Mass ≈14.45 < max 30. No node movement except node_4 allowed, which shows no beneficial change on stress within explored range. Areas set to \'2\' provide mid-level cross-section. Following the principle of stress uniformity and minimal mass from history steps.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node_4 at (1.95, 3.35) yields member_1 stress approx -12.55 with mass 14.45. Previous node_4 moves up/down or sideways either increased or kept stress constant. Member lengths and masses stable. No stress or mass penalties exceeded. Optimization converged practically.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met with safety margin. Structural geometry and materials verified.
