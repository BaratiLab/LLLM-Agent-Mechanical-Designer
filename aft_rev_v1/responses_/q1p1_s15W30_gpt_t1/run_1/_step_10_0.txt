  "preamble": "Minimizing stress further while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress is 12.69 within ±15 limit. Total mass is 14.81 under 30. Load/support nodes fixed, can only adjust node_4 position. All members area set at 2 (0.782 area). Member_1 experiences highest compressive stress (-12.69).",

  "analysis": "Member_1 stress (-12.69) near limit, member_3 tension +7.05 moderate. Member lengths and angles affect stress distribution. Load at node_3, so node_4 position controls force path transfers between supports. Node_4 moved closer to node_3 in previous step decreased max stress slightly from iteration 8 to 9. But minimal improvement recently.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing stress involves balancing load path more evenly. Increasing height of node_4 slightly might reduce compression in member_1; decreasing lateral offset might reduce bending. Could try increasing vertical coordinate of node_4 towards 3.6 while adjusting horizontal near 2.1 to 2.3.",

  "reasoning": "Member_1 compression highest. To reduce it, increase diagonal members length or change their angles to redistribute stresses. Maintaining areas at '2' for weight optimization. Node_4 positions near current height (3.55) seem optimal for mass and stress. Too high causes more material mass/force; too low, introduces more compression. Lateral shift of node_4 can redistribute forces, slightly closer to node_3 could reduce member_1 compression.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Compute member lengths:\nmember_1: dist(node_1-node_3) = 2.0 (fixed)\nmember_3: dist(node_1-node_4) ~ sqrt((2.15)^2 + (3.55)^2) ≈ 4.16\nmember_5: dist(node_3-node_4) ~ sqrt((0.15)^2 + (3.55)^2) ≈ 3.56\nTry moving node_4 from (2.15, 3.55) to (2.25, 3.60) to balance forces.\n",

  "calculation": "Move node_4 to (2.25, 3.60). This slightly increases diagonal lengths \(member_3, member_5\) improving stress distribution. Keep member areas at '2'. New approximate lengths:\nmember_3 ~ 4.20\nmember_5 ~ 3.58\nMass remains under limit.\nExpect max stress to reduce slightly below 12.69.\n",

  "scratch_pad_final": "No member area change to avoid mass rise. Node_4 moved right and slightly higher. Load/support nodes fixed. Checked no new members or nodes duplicated. Constraints still satisfied.",
