Load at node_3, supports at node_1 and node_2 pinned and roller respectively. Node_4 adjusted each iteration to reduce stress. Existing member areas fixed at \'2\' which corresponds to area 0.782. Node_3 and support nodes fixed, only node_4 movable.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Stress concentrated mostly in member_1 (-12.31) and member_5 (-9.05) in compression, suggesting those members are critical. Similar areas for all members equalize member capacities, but slight adjustments in node_4\'s vertical and horizontal position can reduce peak stress by improving geometry and load path. Historical iterations show moving node_4 around x=2-3 and y=3-3.7 with member areas fixed at \'2\' is effective for stress reduction. Current location node_4 (1.9,3.5) improved max stress from ~14.8 down to 12.31.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Decrease horizontal distance of node_4 from node_3 to relieve stress in member_1; increase y to improve triangulation and transfer forces. Balance between x and y coordinate essential for minimal stress. Consider moving node_4 slightly rightward (from 1.9 to about 2.1) and slightly upward (from 3.5 to ~3.6), monitoring stress in member_1 and member_5. Maintain member area \'2\' to limit mass increase. These small nodal shifts could relieve member_1 compressive stress and member_5 tension simultaneously.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "The max compressive stress on member_1 suggests a shorter length or better force angle would reduce axial load. A small rightward and upward shift of node_4 increases triangle shape robustness, balancing load paths between members to reduce peak stresses. Since member areas fixed to \'2\' in constraints, geometry optimization is primary lever now. Loading node_3 at (-10, -45°) induces combined tension and compression in members meeting at node_4; improving angle between members at node_4 improves force distribution. Stresses in other members are moderate and can tolerate small changes.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate influence of node_4 position on member lengths and angles. Current node_4 (1.9,3.5) length to node_1 = √((1.9-0)^2 + 3.5^2)=~3.94; to node_3 = √((1.9-2)^2 + (3.5-0)^2) =~3.5; to node_2 = √((6-1.9)^2 + 3.5^2)=~5.14. Slight shift to (2.1,3.6) changes lengths to node_1=~4.02, node_3=~3.60, node_2=4.91, likely reducing stress in member_1 and member_5 by balancing forces more evenly.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Modify node_4 coordinates to (2.1, 3.6). Keep member areas as \'2\'. Members remain {\'member_1\': [\'node_1\', \'node_3\', \'2\'], \'member_2\': [\'node_3\', \'node_2\', \'2\'], \'member_3\': [\'node_1\', \'node_4\', \'2\'], \'member_4\': [\'node_2\', \'node_4\', \'2\'], \'member_5\': [\'node_3\', \'node_4\', \'2\']}.
