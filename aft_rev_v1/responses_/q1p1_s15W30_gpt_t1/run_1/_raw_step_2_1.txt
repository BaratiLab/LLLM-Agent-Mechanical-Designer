Need mass reduction, maintain strength.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Existing design has good stress margins but mass is well above max. Members near node_3 carry load but heavy areas increase mass. Node_4 at (2,4) elevates structure for load distribution but length increases mass. Areas 4 and 3 are large causing high mass. Member_2 (node_3-node_2) with area \'4\' is heavily contributing mass. To reduce mass, reduce large areas and consider altered node_4 elevation to shorten members and reduce member areas. Possibly reduce node_4 height slightly or reposition node_4 horizontally for shorter diagonal members. Keep load and supports fixed. Maintain triangulation for stability.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider lowering node_4 from 4.0 to around 3.2 reduces member lengths, allowing lesser area. Use area 2 or 3 max instead of 4 to reduce mass significantly. Also optimize horizontal position of node_4 from x=2 to near midpoint between node_3 and supports to balance forces. Avoid adding nodes since structure already triangulated. Check all stresses remain below ±15 after area reduction and node reposition.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Adjust node_4 position from (2.0, 4.0) to (3.0, 3.2). Reduce member areas: members_1,2 area from \'4\' to \'3\' (3.128), members_3,4,5 area from \'3\' to \'2\' (0.782). This reduces the big areas and mass significantly while maintaining triangulated structure and load paths. Members: member_1: node_1-node_3, member_2: node_3-node_2, member_3: node_1-node_4, member_4: node_2-node_4, member_5: node_3-node_4.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Shortening node_4 height reduces member length and thus mass; reducing areas lowers mass linearly. Area selections balance allowable stress (±15) and minimize mass. Triangulation retained for geometric stability and force distribution. Node_3 is load node, supports fixed for stability. Using member area below \'4\' significantly cuts mass (about 3 to 30% reduction) while stress capacity remains sufficient given large margin in previous iteration.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths: member_3 & 4 diagonal; length = sqrt((3.0-0)^2 + (3.2-0)^2) ≈ 4.43; member_5 length = sqrt((3.0-2.0)^2+(3.2-0)^2)=sqrt(1+10.24)=3.39; member_1=2.0; member_2=4.0. Mass estimate: sum length*area approx: member_1=2*3.128=6.256; member_2=4*3.128=12.512; member_3=4.43*0.782=3.47; member_4=4.43*0.782=3.47; member_5=3.39*0.782=2.65; total~28.36 < 30 max mass.
