A minimal closed truss is a triangle connecting all nodes, but do we need extra nodes? Constraint is closed structure with no isolated nodes. The existing nodes form a line, so not inherently stable. Minimum closed stable 2D truss requires at least a triangle for stability (all nodes connected and nondominated by one axis). Without extra nodes, only two members connecting node_3 to node_1 and node_2 form a \'V\'. But this is unstable laterally. Adding a fourth node out of line for triangular stability is necessary, but instructions say no node position changes for given nodes, but new nodes are allowed (by omission).",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Add one node above line near node_3 for stability; say node_4 at (2.0, 3.0).

Horizontal equilibrium: vx_1 + vx_2 + 7.07 = 0. Moments about node_1 to find vy_2 and vx_2.\\\n    Assume roller at node_2 only vertical support (so vx_2=0).
