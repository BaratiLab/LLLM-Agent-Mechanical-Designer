  "preamble": "Optimizing node_4 location to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress is close to limit, mass is well under limit. Node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Node_4 can move. Members all area_id=2 for moderate area. Stress concentrated on member_1 (node_1-node_3) at -13.9 near -15 limit. Need to reduce compressive stress here.",
  "analysis": "Member_1 has highest compressive stress, likely due to geometry where node_4 is relatively far vertically causing high force in member_1. Moving node_4 slightly left and lower will reduce frame distortion and compressive force on member_1. Also, all areas same, so no area trade-off needed as mass is low.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing height of node_4 from 3.6 to about 3.3 and shifting x closer to node_3 (2.0) from current 2.9 may reduce moment and compressive stress in member_1. Maintain triangular geometry for closed truss.",
  "reasoning": "Lowering node_4 reduces lever arm of vertical force causing stress in member_1. Shifting node_4 closer to node_3 balances force distribution. Keeping same areas to maintain mass below 30 and ease comparison. No node moves for load/support nodes.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current max compression approx -13.9. Target max compression closer to -10 to -12 for safety margin. Member length impact on mass: same. So change node_4 position only.",
  "calculation": "Updated node_4 at (2.6, 3.3). Member lengths recalculated: node_1-node_4: ~3.98; node_2-node_4: ~3.5; node_3-node_4: ~1.92. Expect reduction in compression on member_1 as bending reduced. Area fixed at '2'=0.782 for all members. Mass under limit retained.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New design proposed to test reduced node_4 height and move closer to node_3. Keeps all constraints, likely reduces max compression stress. Stop is False to continue optimization if needed next iteration.",
