Member_1 experiences highest compressive stress (-12.69).",\n\n  "analysis": "Member_1 stress (-12.69) near limit, member_3 tension +7.05 moderate. Member lengths and angles affect stress distribution. Load at node_3, so node_4 position controls force path transfers between supports. Node_4 moved closer to node_3 in previous step decreased max stress slightly from iteration 8 to 9. But minimal improvement recently.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing stress involves balancing load path more evenly. Increasing height of node_4 slightly might reduce compression in member_1; decreasing lateral offset might reduce bending. Could try increasing vertical coordinate of node_4 towards 3.6 while adjusting horizontal near 2.1 to 2.3.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Member_1 compression highest. To reduce it, increase diagonal members length or change their angles to redistribute stresses. Maintaining areas at \'2\' for weight optimization. Node_4 positions near current height (3.55) seem optimal for mass and stress. Too high causes more material mass/force; too low, introduces more compression.
