Load at node_3, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_4 position changed recently to reduce mass and stress from iteration 2 to 3.",\n  "analysis": "Node_3 (load) and supports cannot move; node_4 moved closer to line node_1-node_2 and slightly back from previous iteration reducing compressive force on member_5. Member areas chosen as \'2\' and \'3\' from last iteration meeting mass (<30) and stress (<15) constraints. Stress max is still elevated on members 3 and 5 (~8.1 and -9.28).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further reduction of compressive stress on member_5 and tensile stress on member_3 can minimize max stress. Adjusting node_4 vertically upward or slightly right may better balance forces. Possibly decrease area on members with low stress (member_2) to save mass and increase area on high-stress members if needed.",\n  "reasoning": "By moving node_4 upward and slightly right, length and angles of members 3,4,5 change, redistributing forces to reduce max stress. Member_2 has low stress (-1.47) and large area (3), area can be reduced to \'1\' (0.195) to save mass and allow increasing area on critical members if needed. Maintaining closed structure and constraints is critical. The area selection should keep sum mass <30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate node_4 new y ~3.3-3.5 and x ~2.8-3.0; check member lengths and resulting approximate axial stresses - qualitative. Reduce member_2 area \'3\'->\'1\'. Member_1 and 2 area can be \'2\' if stress low. Member_3 and 5 remain \'2\' or may increase to \'3\' if mass allows.",\n  "calculation": "Node_4 move to (2.85, 3.28). Member_1 and 2 area reduced from 3 (1.759) to 2 (0.782). Member_3,4,5 area remain 2 (0.782) for balance. Approximate mass: member_1 length ~ sqrt((2-0)^2+0) = 2, mass=2*0.782=1.564. member_2 length ~ (6-2)=4, mass=4*0.782=3.128. member_3 length ~ sqrt((2.85-0)^2 + (3.28-0)^2) ~4.38, mass=4.38*0.782=3.43. member_4 length ~ sqrt((6-2.85)^2 + 3.28^2) ~4.23, mass=4.23*0.782=3.31. member_5 length ~ sqrt((2.85-2)^2 + (3.28-0)^2) ~3.4, mass=3.4*0.782=2.66. Total mass ~1.56+3.13+3.43+3.31+2.66=14.1 < 19.6 previous, significantly reduced. Stress likely reduced due to better balanced geometry and adequate areas.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "New node positions respect constraints. Areas chosen to reduce mass but maintain strength and reduce max stresses. Load and support node locations unchanged. Structure remains closed with 5 members.
