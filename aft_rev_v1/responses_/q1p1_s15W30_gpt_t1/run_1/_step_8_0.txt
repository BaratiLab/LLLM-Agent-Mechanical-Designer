  "preamble": "Optimizing stress distribution by adjusting node_4 for load support.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max stress ±15, mass ≤30. Current max stress 13.79, mass 14.3, within limits. Load at node_3 (-10, -45°). Only node_4 movable.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design mass is low enough to allow for slight node_4 repositioning to reduce high compressive stress in member_1 (-13.79) while keeping other stresses safe and mass limit respected. Current area assignments (area_id=2) for all members appear efficient.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Moving node_4 slightly backward and upward to reduce axial compression in member_1 by better force transfer through members 3 and 5. Smaller angle at node_4 between members 3,4,5 can reduce peak compressive stress in member_1.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_1 is highly compressed (-13.79), member_5 moderately compressed (-9.19). To lower member_1 stress, move node_4 towards node_1 but slightly upward to maintain structural height and stiffness. This redistributes load through diagonal members (3 and 5). Keep member areas unchanged (area_id=2).",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Shift node_4 from (2.6, 3.3) to approx. (2.3, 3.7). Check member lengths: node_1-node_4 slightly longer, node_2-node_4 slightly longer; node_3-node_4 will be shorter. Expected effect: reduced compressive stress in member_1 due to better load path, overall constraints met.",
  
  "calculation": "New node_4 position: x=2.3, y=3.7. Estimated mass change negligible as member lengths change little. Member stress expected to decrease in member_1 from -13.79 to below -13.0, max stress safe. Max mass stays below 15. Area factors unchanged. Verification post new FEM step recommended.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved left and up to reduce compression in member_1. Maintain closed truss with no change to other nodes or members. No area change to maintain mass control.",
