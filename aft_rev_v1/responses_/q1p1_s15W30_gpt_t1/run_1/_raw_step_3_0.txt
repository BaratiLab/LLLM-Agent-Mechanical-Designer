Load at node_3, supports fixed. Aim to reduce max stress further by repositioning node_4 (only free node).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has moderate max stress in member_5 (-9.4735). Compressive stress in member_5 is highest magnitude. The position of node_4 influences the geometry and force distribution. Current y=3.2 for node_4 is intermediate between previous iterations. Member areas chosen are moderate 2 and 3. Mass is well below limit, so some area increase might be possible but priority is stress minimization by geometry. Node_4 should be repositioned slightly to reduce high compressive stress in member_5 (between node_3 and node_4).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Compress stress in member_5 could be reduced by slightly moving node_4 closer to node_3 horizontally or altering vertical position to balance forces. Avoid increasing length too much to keep mass down.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_5 (node_3-node_4) with high compressive stress may be relieved by slightly decreasing the angle and length. Moving node_4 closer to node_3 along x direction should reduce member_5 length and compressive stress. Also, changing y coordinate slightly may improve force flow. Since node_3 is at (2.0, 0.0), and node_4 at (3.0, 3.2), try moving node_4 to x ~ 2.7 and y ~ 3.0 to reduce member_5 length; still keep triangle shape for stability.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: member_5 length currently = sqrt((3.0-2.0)^2 + (3.2-0)^2) = sqrt(1 + 10.24) = sqrt(11.24) ~ 3.35. Reducing x difference to 0.7 and y to 3 reduces length to sqrt(0.7^2 + 3^2)= sqrt(0.49 + 9)= sqrt(9.49) ~3.08, shortening member_5 by ~0.27 meters.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Adjust node_4 to (2.7, 3.0). Keep member areas same as iteration 2 for feasibility (area_id \'2\' for members connected to node_4 and \'3\' for chord members).
