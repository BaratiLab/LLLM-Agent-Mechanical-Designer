Goal: closed truss, minimized stress and mass.",\n\n    "analysis": "Existing nodes lie along x-axis, load at node_3 downward left (-45°). To form closed truss and reduce stress, introduce a fourth node elevated above baseline for triangulation and load transfer. Triangular shape reduces bending moments, distributes forces effectively. Connect all nodes for closed geometry: baseline (nodes 1,2,3) plus node_4 above node_3, results in multiple triangles enhancing stability and stress distribution. Assign areas based on member criticality (shorter members with smaller area, longer members with higher area for strength). Estimate stresses by static equilibrium assuming pin joints and axial forces only.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Consider node_4 at (2.0, y) with y > 0, optimize y for minimal mass and stress. Use simple truss method: forces from load resolve mainly through members (1-4), (4-3), (2-4), and baseline members. Aim for tensile and compressive stresses balanced, all under ±15. Area selection starts low, increment if stress or mass limits exceeded.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 = (2.0, 3.0) to create two triangles: (1-3-4) and (2-3-4). Member lengths calculated using distance formula. Members: (1-3), (3-2), (1-4), (4-3), (2-4). Baseline members (1-3) and (3-2) shorter, assign moderate area for load transfer. Members to node_4 longer, assign areas prudently. Check mass = Σ(length × area), must ≤ 30. Estimate forces by equilibrium: vertical + horizontal at node_3 and node_4.

Assume initial area assignments: baseline members area_id \'2\' (0.782), diagonal members area_id \'3\' (1.759). Mass = sum(length × area). Stress approx = force in member / area.
