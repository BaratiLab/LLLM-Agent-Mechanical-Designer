  "preamble": "Current 2D truss meets all constraints; stress and mass within limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 13.06 < 15; total mass 25.1 < 30; nodes at fixed load/support points and one free node at (2,3).",
  
  "analysis": "Stress in member_1 is highest in compression (-13.06). Areas are moderate. No nodes can move except node_4. Moving node_4 should reduce stress but trade-offs may increase other stresses or mass.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member stresses are reasonably balanced. Member_1 carries highest compressive stress; member_3 has moderate tension. Member masses indicate heavier members at triangle hypotenuse and verticals. Trying to move node_4 closer to reduce lever arm might reduce member_1 stress.",

  "reasoning": "To reduce max compressive stress in member_1, decrease bending moment effect by lowering node_4 or shifting it horizontally. However, pushing node_4 below current height conflicts with current load direction (-45 degrees). Moving node_4 horizontally closer to node_1 decreases member_3 length, reducing mass and potentially stress. Member area selection is already moderate; further reduction risks stress limits violation. Thus, minimal gains from moving node_4.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress approx proportional to force / area; mass proportional to length * area. Given constraints, area sizes chosen are mid-range (1.759 to 3.128). Node_4 at (2,3) can be moved within some bounds but load/support nodes fixed. Attempting node_4 at (1.8, 2.8) reduces member_1 stress slightly but marginal effect on overall max stress.",

  "calculation": "Small downward and leftward shift of node_4 from (2,3) to (1.8,2.8) reduces compressive stress in member_1 from -13.06 to ~-12.7 estimated. Other membersâ€™ stress change minimal. Mass stays below 30. However, impact minor; existing configuration already optimized given constraints and fixed nodes.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "No significant benefit from further node adjustment; area changes not allowed except by area_id. Current design close to ideal balance of stress and mass. Recommend stopping optimization.",
