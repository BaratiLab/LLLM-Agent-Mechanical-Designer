Adding node_5 and horizontal member_8 did not reduce stresses adequately. Members connecting node_1, node_3 and node_3, node_4 are overstressed. Overall mass is acceptable but inefficient load path causes overload.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on redistributing forces by improving triangulation and support load transfer. Remove member_8 (node_1-node_2) which carries moderate compression but adds no triangulation. Reposition node_4 upward and introduce an additional auxiliary node to strengthen load path from node_3 to supports. Use moderate area members strategically to reduce stresses below limits.",\n  "proposal": "Remove member_8. Move node_4 to (2.0, 4.0). Add node_5 at (4.0, 3.5) to form a stiffer triangular network near the load. Connect: node_1-node_4, node_2-node_5, node_3-node_4, node_3-node_5, node_4-node_5, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3.
