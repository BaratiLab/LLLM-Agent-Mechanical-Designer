Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Current iteration violates stress constraints, max stress ~896 >> 15. Mass is 20.1 < 30 feasible. Need to redesign to reduce stress drastically, possibly by added triangulation and more effective load path.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has over-stressed members near load node_3 especially member_3 (node_3 to node_5). Top nodes (node_4,node_5,node_6) attempt load transfer but stresses are unbalanced and large. Member area sizes not effective to reduce max stress. Load is inclined, so vertical and horizontal triangulation needed. Current pattern lacks proper triangulation and redundancy.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_6 to reduce complexity and redistribute forces. Add node above load to better distribute stresses. Use more triangulation between supports and load node. Increase cross-sectional areas for primary load path members. Areas capped to max 3 (1.759) or 4 (3.128) to keep mass manageable.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Redesign nodes keeping node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Remove nodes_5 and 6 to reduce length and stiffness mismatch. Add new node_4 at (3.0, 3.0) to form stable triangular bracing. Member connections: node_1-node_4 (area 2), node_2-node_4(area 3), node_3-node_4(area 3), node_1-node_3(area 2), node_2-node_3(area 1). This triangulates the loading around node_3 and redistributes stresses.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangulation with moderate member areas creates lower stress paths. Node_4 placement at (3.0,3.0) matches force direction -45° load for efficient transfer. Triangles between supports and load spread load, avoiding single long members. Smaller areas in less loaded members reduce mass. Using areas 1-3 balances weight and strength. Member lengths shorter or balanced to avoid stress concentration.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_4 ~3.605, node_2-node_4 ~3.605, node_3-node_4 ~3.162, node_1-node_3=2.0, node_2-node_3=4.0. Estimate mass: sum(length*area) roughly: (3.605*0.782)+(3.605*1.759)+(3.162*1.759)+(2*0.782)+(4*0.195)=~2.82+6.34+5.56+1.56+0.78=~17.06 <30. Max stress expected reduced by symmetrical triangulation and higher area on critical members (node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4).",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member areas: member_1(node_1-node_4):2=0.782, member_2(node_2-node_4):3=1.759, member_3(node_3-node_4):3=1.759, member_4(node_1-node_3):2=0.782, member_5(node_2-node_3):1=0.195.
