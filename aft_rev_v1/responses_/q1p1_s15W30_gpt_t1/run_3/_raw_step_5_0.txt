Members connected to node_4 carry variable stresses. Reducing tensile stress at member_4 needed; member_4 connects node_1 to node_3 horizontally with area 2. Increasing area may reduce stress but increases mass. Alternatively, adding diagonal bracing or repositioning node_4 upward to reduce tension in member_4 is possible.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_4 is under high tension; node_4 elevation affects load path; check if moving node_4 slightly up and adjusting member areas can help; consider adding one more node to stabilize force flow; members from node_2 and node_3 at max areas can be optimized; current scheme is near minimal mass, no redundant members.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep nodes node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed as per instructions. Move node_4 slightly higher to (3.0, 3.6) to better distribute loads. Adjust member areas: increase area of member_4 (node_1-node_3) to 3 (1.759), decrease member_5 area (node_2-node_3) to 0 (1.0), maintain others as-is or reduce to lower mass. Members: 1: area 2(0.782), 2: area 3(1.759), 3: area 2(0.782), 4: area 3(1.759), 5: area 0 (1.0). Member_5 area reduced as it carries moderate compression (-12.0873).",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Raising node_4 redistributes vertical load paths, relieving tension on member_4. Increasing member_4 area reduces tensile stress safely within limits. Reducing member_5 area saves mass without causing constraint violation. Member_2 has low stress; area can remain medium. This balances mass and stresses tightly below limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculations: \\nL_m1: dist node_1(0,0) to node_4(3,3.6) ≈ sqrt(3^2 + 3.6^2)=4.68\\nL_m4: node_1(0,0) to node_3(2,0)=2.0\\nL_m5: node_2(6,0) to node_3(2,0)=4\\nEstimated mass: sum length*area\\nmember_1:4.68*0.782=3.66\\nmember_4:2*1.759=3.52\\nmember_5:4*1=4\\nTotal currently well below 30. Stress recalibration needed after adjustments.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member 4 area increase from 2 to 3 (0.782 to 1.759) halves the stress magnitude from -15.07 to approx -7.5. Node_4 higher reduces bending moment on member_4, lowering tensile stress further. Member 5 area reduction saves ~3.12 mass units. Total mass estimate ~ 3.66+7.46 (m2) + 3.66 (m3*area2) + 3.52 +4= approx 22.3, under 30.
