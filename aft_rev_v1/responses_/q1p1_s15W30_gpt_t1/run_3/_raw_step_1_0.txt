Existing structure exceeds ±15 stress on members 1 and 2 and total mass within limits. Need stiffer members on tension/compression paths and better load distribution.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current design has overstressed members 1 (27.84) and 2 (18.36). Member 3 has large area (3) adding to mass but low stress (-4.02). Members 4 and 5 have moderate negative stress (-12.5 and -3.44). Load is off-center at node_3, so structure must better transfer load to supports by repositioning nodes/members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing stress requires shorter, direct load paths or larger area in critical members. Possibly add diagonal brace between node_1 and node_2 to stiffen base; add intermediate node higher to reduce member length and stress. Decrease member_3 area as stress low, redistribute areas.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add one intermediate node higher than node_4 (e.g. node_5 at x=3.5, y=4.5). Connect node_3 to node_5, node_4 to node_5. Adjust member areas: increase area in key tension/compression members, reduce in underutilized members. Add diagonal base member between node_1 and node_2 for base stability.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 provides better load transfer and triangular stiffness. Diagonal base member reduces bending moment on base. Reassigning areas balances mass and stress, staying under max mass. Smaller areas on less stressed members reduce mass, larger areas on critical stress members keep stress within ±15 MPa. Member lengths reduce so reduced stress required area.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_1-node_5 ~ 5.70, node_2-node_5 ~ 3.2, will reduce stress on node_4. Area selections: critical members use area=2 or 3, non-critical area=1 or 0. Roller and pinned supports unchanged. Node_3 remains at [2.0,0.0] for load application.",\n\n  "calculation": "Estimated max stress ≤15 MPa in new design with redistributed areas. Total mass calculated with new member lengths and area. Member_3 area reduced to 1 from 3. Member_1 and member_2 area increased to 2. Added member base diagonal with area=1. Estimated total mass ≤ 25, stress balanced within limits.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes/members. Node positions precise. Supports and loads fixed.
