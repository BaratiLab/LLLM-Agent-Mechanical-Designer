  "preamble": "Refine nodal position of node_4 to reduce max stress further within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress at 9.38 < 15 and total mass 22.35 < 30. Load/support nodes fixed, only node_4 movable. Current max stress compressive on member_3 (-9.38).",
  
  "analysis": "Current structure has balanced stress levels well below limits. Largest magnitude compressive stress on member_3 (-9.38) and tensile on member_1 (7.85). Node_4 adjusted upward previously to 3.6m height. Members' area choices seem reasonable. Mass utilization near 75% capacity. Member_5 carries small stress (-1.96) with largest area (1). Opportunities remain to reduce stresses by slightly repositioning node_4 vertically or horizontally to improve force distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on node_4 repositioning to reduce negative stress on member_3, possibly by increasing vertical height slightly and shifting slightly right to balance load paths. Avoid large area increase or additional members to keep mass down.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_3 compression could be reduced by increasing node_4 height to reduce bending or shear demand on node_3. Shifting node_4 horizontally closer to node_3 (from x=3 to ~3.2) could redistribute axial forces more evenly. Maintain areas as is to keep mass stable. Do not change load/support nodes and avoid extra members to comply with problem instructions.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Let new node_4 coords be (3.2, 3.8). Member lengths: node_1-node_4 ~ sqrt(3.2^2+3.8^2)=4.99m, node_2-node_4 ~ sqrt((6-3.2)^2+3.8^2)=4.6m, node_3-node_4 ~ sqrt((3.2-2)^2+3.8^2)=3.9m. Expected shorter length for member_2 reduces mass and stress. Member_4 (node_1-node_3) unchanged. Member_5 (node_2-node_3) unchanged. With same areas, anticipate slight stress reduction on member_3 and balancing compression/tension.",
  
  "calculation": "Recalculate approximate mass: summation length x area. Mass ≈ (4.99*0.782)+(4.6*1.759)+(3.9*0.782)+(4*1.759)+(4*1) ≈ 3.9+8.09+3.05+7.04+4 =26.08 < 30. Expected max stress to reduce below current 9.38 with better geometry distribution. Constraints on stress ±15 and mass <30 satisfied.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved slightly right and up improves stress distribution. No area changes, no new members. Load/support fixed nodes preserved. Current design improved toward stress minimization within constraints. Continue optimization.",
