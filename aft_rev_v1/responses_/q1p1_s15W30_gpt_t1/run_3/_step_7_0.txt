  "preamble": "Optimized 2D truss with minimized stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Goals: minimize max stress ≤ 15, total mass ≤ 30. Current structure satisfies constraints with max stress 9.48 and total mass 22.82. Load at node_3, supports fixed.",
  
  "analysis": "Current node_4 moved upward and right to (3.2, 3.8) reduced max stress to 9.48, mass is within limits. Areas selected reasonably balance stress/mass trade-off. Members carry forces safely under limits.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further node movement limited as load/support nodes fixed. More members adds complexity and mass. Current stress already well below max allowed. Small stress margin to improve but mass and geometry optimal.",
  
  "reasoning": "Current configuration with node_4 slightly offset optimizes force path minimizing largest stress in members, particularly tension in member_3 and compression in member_4. Area selection is appropriate per member force levels and maintains mass below 30.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "No violations of max stress or mass constraints. Attempting to reduce max stress further may increase mass or cause geometry infeasibility. Node_4 position near optimal balance for load transfer. Members connect all nodes forming closed truss without redundancy.",
  
  "calculation": "Member lengths and areas produce total mass 22.82 < 30. Max stress magnitude 9.48 < 15. Tensile/compressive stresses all within limits. Member areas chosen from allowed discrete sets matching required capacity. Load at node_3 well supported by triangle formed with members 1,2,3 and base with member 4,5.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints strictly satisfied, stress minimized compared to previous iterations. Node_4 position is within permissible range and minimal changes produce no gains. Stop further iteration.",
