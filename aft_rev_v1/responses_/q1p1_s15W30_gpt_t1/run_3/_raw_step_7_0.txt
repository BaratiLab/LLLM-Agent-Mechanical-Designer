Areas selected reasonably balance stress/mass trade-off. Members carry forces safely under limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further node movement limited as load/support nodes fixed. More members adds complexity and mass. Current stress already well below max allowed.

Area selection is appropriate per member force levels and maintains mass below 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "No violations of max stress or mass constraints. Attempting to reduce max stress further may increase mass or cause geometry infeasibility. Node_4 position near optimal balance for load transfer.
