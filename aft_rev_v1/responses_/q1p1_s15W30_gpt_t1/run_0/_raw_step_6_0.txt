Constraints: max stress ±15, total mass <=30. Current design fails at high stresses on member_6 (26.44) and member_7 (-21.95). Mass close to limit at 29.8.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure\'s max tensile and compressive stresses exceed limits mainly in members connecting nodes near load (node_5 to node_2 and node_3 to node_4). Large areas in low-stress members add mass. Structure has 5 nodes but limited vertical bracing for load at node_3 with diagonal. Existing nodes fixed at supports and load; we can add/move internal nodes to improve force flow and reduce stress concentrations.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress on member_6 and 7, consider relocating node_5 or adding a new node to distribute load better. Also, adjust areas to lower mass on low-stress members and increase in critical members within limits. Possibly create a stiffer upper chord to reduce tension in member_6 by increasing area or geometric advantage.",\n\n    "proposal": "Add a new node (node_6) between node_4 and node_5 higher up to create a triangular support, redistribute members to reduce long diagonals, and adjust member areas to meet stress and mass constraints. Keep load/support nodes fixed.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Adding node_6 at a higher position reduces the length and stress on members connecting node_5 and node_2 by creating a braced triangle. Redistributing members creates better load path, decreasing maximum stress. Using mid-range areas balances mass and strength. Remove redundant members to save mass, increase areas in tension members near load to keep stress <=15. Lower area in compression members with low stress to reduce mass.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Recompute member lengths for new geometry, estimate member forces roughly from static equilibrium and distribute areas accordingly. Check sum of lengths*area_density <=30 and max stress within ±15. Remove member_7 (node_3-node_4) which currently has high compressive stress and provide alternative force path to reduce peak stresses.",\n\n    "calculation": "Node positions: node_6 at (3.5, 5.5).
