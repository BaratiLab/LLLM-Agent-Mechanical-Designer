  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under given load/support with stress and mass constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 downward-left. Supports at nodes 1 and 2 fixed. Max stress allowed ±15, max mass ≤30. Current design violates stress (max 424.23) and mass (35.1>30).",
  
  "analysis": "High stress on member_7 (node_5-node_2) and member_5 (node_6-node_5) indicates load path concentrated causing overstress. Mass exceeds limit at 35.1. Nodes 1, 2, and 3 fixed; nodes 4, 5, 6 added for bracing but some members carry too high stress. The geometry can be improved to reduce stress and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce high stress members by better load transfer with alternative node positions and member layout. Possibly remove node_6 and rearrange node_4 and node_5 to create a more evenly distributed truss with load paths in triangulated form.",
  
  "proposal": "Keep nodes 1, 2, 3 fixed. Remove node_6 to simplify. Adjust node_4 higher and node_5 shifted between node_2 and node_4 for better load distribution. Create members 1-3, 1-4, 3-5, 4-5, 2-5, and 3-4. Select smaller area members except critical compressive/tensile ones. Assign area by stress demand. ",
  
  "reasoning": "Triangular truss with nodes 1, 3, 4, 5 and support nodes 1,2 handling load at 3 minimizes material and balances stress. No redundant nodes means less mass, better force transfer paths lower stress. Assign areas according to member stress demand predicted by angles and lengths to stay within ±15 stress.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Check lengths: 1-3 ~2.0, 1-4 ~5.3, 3-4 ~5.3, 3-5 ~3.1, 4-5 ~2.3, 2-5 ~1.8. Use areas: high axial force members area id ~3 (1.759), low force area 1 (0.195) or 2(0.782). Chose heavier areas for main load path (1-3, 1-4, 3-5).",
  
  "calculation": "Estimate mass = sum(length*area). For example: (1-3) 2.0*1.759=3.518; (1-4)5.3*1.759=9.32; (3-5)3.1*1.759=5.45; (4-5)2.3*0.782=1.8; (2-5)1.8*0.195=0.351; (3-4)5.3*0.782=4.15 total ~24.59 under 30. Stress expected <15 by triangulated layout.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "No member area exceeds needed for stress. Node_5 positioned to balance forces. Removed node_6 to reduce complexity/mass and reduce stress on long members. Members interconnected for triangulation to better distribute loads.",
