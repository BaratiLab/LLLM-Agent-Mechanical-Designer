Node_4 could slightly move to further balance forces on diagonal members. Areas could be slightly reduced where stress is low.",\n  "reasoning": "Members with low stress (member_2, member_4) can reduce area from 2 or 3 to 1 (0.195) to reduce mass. Increase area on most stressed member_5 from 2 to 3 to reduce stress margin. Slightly lower node_4 to 3.7 may reduce tensile stress on member_3 and compressive stress on member_5. This maintains constraints and improves balance.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Areas: member_1(3), member_2(1), member_3(2), member_4(1), member_5(3). Node_4 coordinates (2.0, 3.7).
