All load and support nodes fixed, current layout balanced.",\n  "analysis": "Stress distribution is moderate and under constraints; structural form is closed and stable. Member areas correspond to reducing stress without excess mass. Further node position tweaks yield minimal stress improvement.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further node movement unlikely to reduce max stress significantly due to existing balanced geometry. Mass remains under max allowed.",\n  "reasoning": "Load predominantly downward-left at node_3; current members distribute force evenly. Node_4 high and node_5 intermediate create triangulated stable form. Lowering node_4 risks increased stress; moving node_5 closer to node_3 or node_2 may increase stress. Cross members maintain stability.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member stresses between -7.43 to 7.83 with most well below ±10. Mass usage efficient with area choices tied to stress demands; no member oversized.",\n  "calculation": "No adjustments needed — max stress 7.83 <15 and mass 27.06<30.
