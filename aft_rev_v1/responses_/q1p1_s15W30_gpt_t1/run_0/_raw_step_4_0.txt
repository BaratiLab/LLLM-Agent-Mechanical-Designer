Max |stress| ≤15, total mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Previous iterations showed member_4 stress exceeded 15 and total mass reduced successfully by lowering areas, but stress constraint violation persists. Current structure too lightly reinforced in tensile member_4. Members area distribution and geometry need refinement to reduce peak stress and maintain mass ≤30.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_4 with area \'1\' too small, causing overstress (17.8 >15). Member_2 also near limit at 13.07. Member_5 area \'3\' is largest; possibly oversized. Node_4 height at 3.7 meters reduced from 4m — shorter height increases horizontal forces, contributing to stress. Adding a node for force redistribution or adjusting member areas can help.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add one node (node_5) between node_3 and node_2 elevated to relieve stress on member_4. Reassign member cross-section areas: Increase area for member_4 and member_2 to reduce tensile stress, reduce member_5 area to decrease mass. Modify members to form two triangles sharing node_5 for better force distribution.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 around x=4.0, y=2.0 creates new triangulation distributing load more evenly. Member_4 and member_2 area increased from \'1\' (0.195) to \'3\' (1.759) reduces stress. Member_5 area reduced from \'3\' (1.759) to \'1\' (0.195) reduces mass. Areas chosen balance stress and mass constraints. Geometry preserves support and load nodes; node_5 addition is optimal to offload critical members.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Length calculations: member_4 original length ~ sqrt((6-2)^2 + (3.7)^2)=5.07m; increased area 1.759 reduces stress proportionally. Node_5 at (4.0,2.0), lengths: node_4-node_5 ~2.06m, node_5-node_2 ~2.24m. Member stresses reduce due to shorter members. Mass sum estimated below 30.
