Current max stress 36.26 on member_5, mass 22.37. Existing topology stressed at diagonal member_5. Load at node_3 downward-left, supports at nodes 1(pinned), 2(roller). Need to reduce stress concentrations and balance load path.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Currently the diagonal member_5 connecting node_3 (loaded) to node_4 is highly stressed (-36.26), exceeding ±15 allowed. Members along base are under less stress -4 to 3.2 range. Total mass is within limit but stress violation critical. The diagonal member appears too small area (area 1 = 0.195) but stress still too high, indicates geometry and load path suboptimal. Geometry with node_4 at (2,3) creates a short vertical member and a long diagonal member carrying most load. This concentrates stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "A better truss would distribute load more evenly, with more triangulation between supports and load node. Consider moving node_4 horizontally to improve angle of diagonals, or add an additional node to create more triangular members. Also can redistribute cross sectional areas to larger areas on the highly stressed members to reduce stress. Keep load and support nodes fixed. Node_3 at (2,0) loaded lies between supports. Maybe add node between nodes 2 and 3 or above node_3 to form two diagonals with less stress each.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add an additional node (node_5) above node_3 at about (4.0, 2.5) to create two diagonals from node_3 and node_2 to node_5, plus a vertical from node_5 down to node_4 to improve load path. Adjust areas: increase diagonal members areas to spread load reducing stress below ±15. Keep base members moderate area. Proposed nodes: keep node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (2,3), new node_5(4, 2.5). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_2-node_5, node_3-node_5. Assign areas considering length × area and mass constraints.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 creates more triangles and better load distribution reducing peak member stresses. The diagonal from node_3 to node_5 shares load with node_2-node_5 diagonal reducing stress concentration on current diagonal node_3-node_4. Member lengths and areas balanced to stay within mass and stress limits. Areas selected from given set to keep total mass < 30 and max stress < ±15. Replace existing smaller area on critical diagonal with larger appropriate area to reduce stress. Maintain pinned and roller supports for statical determinacy.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: node_1-node_3: 2m; node_3-node_2:4m; node_1-node_4:3m; node_4-node_5 ~2.06m; node_2-node_5 ~0.71√((6-4)^2 + (0-2.5)^2)=~2.9m; node_3-node_5 ~2.91m. Areas: increase diagonals to area 4(3.128) or 5(4.887) for lower stress. Base members mid area 3(1.759). Summing length×area kept under max mass 30.

For critical diagonals node_2-node_5 and node_3-node_5 use area 3(1.759) to keep stress ~15. Other members area 2(0.782). Adjusted mass ~28.
