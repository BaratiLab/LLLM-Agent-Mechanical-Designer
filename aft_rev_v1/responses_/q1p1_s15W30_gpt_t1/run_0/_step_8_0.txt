  "preamble": "Optimized 2D truss with minimized stress and acceptable mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Maximum stress 7.83 well within ±15 limit; mass 27.06 under 30 max. All load and support nodes fixed, current layout balanced.",
  "analysis": "Stress distribution is moderate and under constraints; structural form is closed and stable. Member areas correspond to reducing stress without excess mass. Further node position tweaks yield minimal stress improvement.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further node movement unlikely to reduce max stress significantly due to existing balanced geometry. Mass remains under max allowed.",
  "reasoning": "Load predominantly downward-left at node_3; current members distribute force evenly. Node_4 high and node_5 intermediate create triangulated stable form. Lowering node_4 risks increased stress; moving node_5 closer to node_3 or node_2 may increase stress. Cross members maintain stability.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member stresses between -7.43 to 7.83 with most well below ±10. Mass usage efficient with area choices tied to stress demands; no member oversized.",
  "calculation": "No adjustments needed — max stress 7.83 <15 and mass 27.06<30. Geometry stable with node_1 at origin, node_2 at x=6 fixed. Load at node_3 at y=0 fixed as well.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Current configuration optimal given constraints and load/support nodes fixed. Stress minimization near best achievable with given connectivity and node positions.",
