Initial structure is a line; must add nodes/members for triangulation.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current nodes are colinear, no closed shape; add node(s) above baseline to form triangles. Truss must be closed (all nodes interconnected). Strategy: add single node above baseline roughly centered near node_3\'s x=2.0 to form two triangles covering nodes 1-3 and 3-2. Supporting load at node_3 requires stiffness there. Triangular truss with nodes 1, 2, 3 and new node (node_4) above baseline forms 2 triangles sharing node_3. Constraints: stress ≤±15, mass ≤30. Use member areas from 0 to 10. Approximate length and select minimal sufficient areas to resist load.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) (optimizing vertical height to balance load reaction forces). Member connections: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4 for triangulation and load path. Calculate member lengths, use simple truss analysis assuming pin-jointed members, load at node_3 down-left at 45°, supports resist reactions.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Closed truss requires nodes and members forming triangles. Node 4 above creates closed framework. Stress and mass minimized by choosing minimal needed areas. Load applied at node_3 results in tension/compression in members connected to node_3 and node_4. Use equilibrium of forces and truss member force calculation (method of joints or sections) to estimate member forces. Area size chosen so that axial force / (area × allowable stress) ≤ 1. Mass calculated as sum(length × area) using given lookup table.

Assume allowable max stress ±15, allowable load per area: stress = force / area ≤ 15 → area ≥ force / 15.

Calculate forces, assign areas from table ensuring force/area ≤ 15. Then calculate mass = ∑ length × area_id converted to corresponding mass value from table.
