  "preamble": "Optimize truss to minimize stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress is 9.04 < 15, total mass 27.59 < 30, structure is statically stable with supports fixed.",
  "analysis": "Current max stress is well below limit; mass near limit. Load applied at node_3. Node_4 moved from y=3.0 to y=4.0 to relieve stress. Members are sized with areas mostly 2 or 3 to balance mass and strength. Stresses are compressive and tensile within Â±15.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Current design is nearly optimal in stress. Further reducing max stress may increase mass or complexity. Node_4 could slightly move to further balance forces on diagonal members. Areas could be slightly reduced where stress is low.",
  "reasoning": "Members with low stress (member_2, member_4) can reduce area from 2 or 3 to 1 (0.195) to reduce mass. Increase area on most stressed member_5 from 2 to 3 to reduce stress margin. Slightly lower node_4 to 3.7 may reduce tensile stress on member_3 and compressive stress on member_5. This maintains constraints and improves balance.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Areas: member_1(3), member_2(1), member_3(2), member_4(1), member_5(3). Node_4 coordinates (2.0, 3.7). Mass and stress estimated based on length and area changes. Total mass expected < 28.5. Max stress expected < 9.",
  "calculation": "Reducing member_2 and member_4 area decreases mass by ~3.0. Increasing member_5 area improves stress margin, reducing max stress from -9.04 to ~-7.0. Node_4 moved down 0.3 units reduces tension on member_3 and compression on member_5 by ~10%. Mass within limits, max stress well within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Confirm no duplicate nodes or members, supports and load nodes fixed, areas from allowed set. Closed truss maintained. Optimized mass and stress balanced and lowered. Ready for next FEM evaluation.",
