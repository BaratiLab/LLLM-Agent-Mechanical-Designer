Constraints: max stress ±15, mass ≤30. Use available nodes at fixed supports. Existing iter1 has member_1 overstressed at -40. Area scaling needed or topology change.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure overstresses member_1 connecting node_1 to node_3. Mass is safe at 20.38 but stress limit violated. Members with area 2 or 3 already large. Current topology doesn\'t effectively transfer load. Node_5 position causes longer members with large area increases. Member_1 is short but highly stressed, indicative of poor load path or inadequate connectivity near load node.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Removing or shifting node_5, adding a vertical or near vertical node above node_3 to spread load. Consider triangle truss with nodes_1, 2, 3 and a higher node_4 to transfer load via axial members. Adjust areas to balance stress and mass.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 4.0) above node_3 (load node). Use members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, and node_3-node_4 for triangulation. Set areas conservatively from area 2 to 4 to reduce stress. Remove node_5 to reduce complexity and member length. This 4-node layout provides better force distribution and reduces max stress while keeping mass under limit.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Load on node_3 can be transferred up to node_4 then distributed to supports node_1 and node_2. Using triangles stabilizes and reduces bending. Increasing node_4 height increases member length but decreases stress by better load path. Smaller areas reduce mass. Member_3 (node_1-node_4) and member_4 (node_4-node_2) can be moderately sized to carry load. Member_6 from node_3 to node_4 in tension/compression relieves member_1 stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Estimate member lengths: node_1-node_3=2m, node_3-node_2=4m, node_1-node_4=√(2²+4²)=4.472 m, node_4-node_2=√(4²+4²)=5.657 m, node_3-node_4=4 m. Assign area_id 3 (1.759) to critical members and 2 (0.782) to others. Assume axial stresses scale inversely with areas. Mass approx sum(length*area). Max stress < 15 enforced by sizing areas.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Mass = member_1(2*1.759=3.518) + member_2(4*0.782=3.128) + member_3(4.472*1.759=7.865) + member_4(5.657*1.759=9.95) + member_5(4*0.782=3.128) = ~27.59 <30 limit.
