Supports at nodes 1 and 2 fixed. Max stress allowed ±15, max mass ≤30. Current design violates stress (max 424.23) and mass (35.1>30).",\n  \n  "analysis": "High stress on member_7 (node_5-node_2) and member_5 (node_6-node_5) indicates load path concentrated causing overstress. Mass exceeds limit at 35.1. Nodes 1, 2, and 3 fixed; nodes 4, 5, 6 added for bracing but some members carry too high stress. The geometry can be improved to reduce stress and mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce high stress members by better load transfer with alternative node positions and member layout. Possibly remove node_6 and rearrange node_4 and node_5 to create a more evenly distributed truss with load paths in triangulated form.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep nodes 1, 2, 3 fixed. Remove node_6 to simplify. Adjust node_4 higher and node_5 shifted between node_2 and node_4 for better load distribution. Create members 1-3, 1-4, 3-5, 4-5, 2-5, and 3-4. Select smaller area members except critical compressive/tensile ones. Assign area by stress demand. ",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular truss with nodes 1, 3, 4, 5 and support nodes 1,2 handling load at 3 minimizes material and balances stress. No redundant nodes means less mass, better force transfer paths lower stress.

Use areas: high axial force members area id ~3 (1.759), low force area 1 (0.195) or 2(0.782). Chose heavier areas for main load path (1-3, 1-4, 3-5).",\n  \n  "calculation": "Estimate mass = sum(length*area).

Stress expected <15 by triangulated layout.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "No member area exceeds needed for stress. Node_5 positioned to balance forces.
