Load at node_3, supports at nodes 1, 2 fixed. Node_5 centrally placed with optimized intermediate connectivity.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Stress distribution is balanced; max stress member_6 at -7.8292 and other members lower. All members have suitable cross-sectional areas with no over-design. No overload or underutilization observed. Node_5 position at (3.0, 1.5) provides efficient force transfer.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further improvements to lower stress marginally would require significant redesign or node additions, increasing complexity/mass. Current design is optimal trade-off between stress and mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing areas beyond current selection increases mass above limit. Reducing areas causes stress exceedance. Node repositioning restricted for load/support nodes. Internal node 5 position already reasonable. Members connect a closed stable truss. No duplicated members or nodes observed. Constraint set is tight and current design suitably optimized.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Members areas taken from area list {\'1\':0.195, \'2\':0.782, \'3\':1.759, \'4\':3.128}. Total mass = sum(length*area) fits 28.15 <30. Max stress ±7.83 <15. Stability and statics consistent.",\n  \n  "calculation": "No member exceeds stress limits. Node movement limited to avoid load/support nodes changes. Mass margin to 30 is minimal. Small stress margin suggests near optimal. No promising node relocation indicated. Design iteration 6 returns closed truss with minimal stress and mass close to limit.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Stop optimization as stress and mass constraints are satisfied with balanced internal force distribution.
