  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss with given nodes, loads, supports; minimize stress within ±15, mass ≤30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes fixed at node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0) with load at node_3 (-10N at -45°). Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Need closed truss (all nodes connected forming closed loop).",
  
  "analysis": "Given nodes lie on x-axis, with load at node_3 pushing diagonally down-left. To create a closed truss, add additional node(s) above to form triangles for stability. Triangular closed loops reduce bending and efficiently distribute loads, minimizing stress. Keep new nodes as few as possible to limit mass. Member area sizes selected to balance stress <15 and mass <30.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Add 1 new node (node_4) above nodes 2 and 3 to form two triangles: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_3-node_2-node_4, creating a closed loop. Check member lengths, estimate forces, assign cross-sectional areas accordingly.",

  "reasoning": "Adding node_4 at approximately (4,3) above node_3 and node_2 forms two triangles. Members: (1-3), (3-4), (4-2), (2-1) and (1-4) to ensure closed structure. Calculate approximate member lengths, estimate member forces under load and supports using static equilibrium. Assign area sizes from discrete options ensuring stress <15 and total mass <30. Use tensile stress formula σ = Force/(Area). Mass = Σ length*area. Prioritize smaller areas for longer members under lower force.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Members: m1(1-3), m2(3-4), m3(4-2), m4(2-1), m5(1-4). Lengths: 1-3=2m, 3-4 ≈ sqrt((4-2)^2+3^2)=~3.61, 4-2=3m, 2-1=6m, 1-4= sqrt(4^2+3^2)=5m. Approx forces estimated with load vector (-10N, -45°) at node_3, reactions at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Larger forces expected in m1 and m5; assign areas accordingly. Use lower area for members in compression, higher for tension if needed.",

  "calculation": "Approximate forces (simplified statics): assume vertical equilibrium for supports reactions. Load vector components at node_3: Fx = -10*cos(45°)= -7.07N, Fy = -10*sin(45°) = -7.07N downward-left. Reaction forces at supports roughly counteracting load. Assume member m1 (1-3) mostly axial tension ~7N, area choice '2' (0.782) -> stress = 7/0.782 ~9 <15. For m5 (1-4), length 5m, assign area '3' (1.759) to limit stress in members resisting load. Other members set to area '1' (0.195) to save mass. Mass = sum(length×area) ≈ (2×0.782)+(3.61×0.195)+(3×0.195)+(6×0.195)+(5×1.759) = 1.56+0.7+0.59+1.17+8.8=12.82 <30. Stress limits met approximately.", 
  "scratch_pad_final": "Structure with 4 nodes, 5 members closed. Areas selected to balance stress and mass. Supports fixed. Node positions precise to 2 decimals. No duplicate members. Approximate equilibrium satisfied. Ready for output.",
