  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under given loads and constraints on mass and stress.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load of 10 units at node_3 directed -45°; supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Max stress ±15 and max total mass 30. Current max stress 17.88 (>15), total mass 12.7369 (<30). Need to reduce max stress while keeping mass low.",

  "analysis": "Current design has max stress violation at member_6 (17.88). Members near node_5 (particularly member_6 and member_3) see imbalanced stress. Some members have zero stress, indicating possible inefficiency. Existing nodes are fixed for loads and supports. Node_5 currently at (3.0, 1.5) acts as intermediate. Areas for members_6 and _3 are minimal (1), so thickness is small, possibly causing stress concentration. Member connections look sufficient for a statically determinate-type truss but stress not within limits.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress, increase cross-sectional area on highly stressed members or reroute forces by node relocation or adding intermediate nodes. Node_5 reposition may balance force flow better. Adding one extra node near load to reduce member length under tension and compression could help. Use areas between 2 and 4 for stressed members to keep mass reasonable. Avoid adding unnecessary members increasing mass. Check force resolution post-adjustment.",

  "proposal": "Keep nodes_1,2,3 fixed as supports and load points. Add node_6 at (3.5, 1.0) to better distribute load path. Move node_5 slightly to (3.0, 1.8). Modify members to connect node_3 and node_6, node_6 to node_4, node_6 to node_5. Increase area for members under higher stress (e.g., members connected to node_6). Remove less effective members member_5 and member_7 to reduce mass and simplify force path.",

  "reasoning": "Introducing node_6 redistributes forces from node_3 to node_5 and node_4 through shorter, more direct members, lowering stress concentrations. Enlarging areas of high-stress members by selecting areas between 2 to 4 maintains strength without excessive mass. Removing redundant members simplifies load paths and avoids unnecessary mass. Slight elevation of node_5 balances vertical force components from load. This maintains statical determinacy and equilibrium.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_6 = (3.5,1.0), node_5=(3.0,1.8). Members: (1) node_1-node_3 (area 2), (2) node_3-node_6 (area 3), (3) node_6-node_5 (area 2), (4) node_5-node_4 (area 3), (5) node_4-node_2 (area 2), (6) node_1-node_5 (area 1), (7) node_6-node_4 (area 1). Total length approximations ensure mass < 30. Stress reduced by shorter members and increased cross sections in load paths.",

  "calculation": "Updated arms lengths and areas: \n- member_1 (node_1-node_3): length ~2.0, area=0.782 (area_id '2'), mass=2*0.782=1.564.\n- member_2 (node_3-node_6): length ~1.12, area=1.759 (area_id '3'), mass~1.97.\n- member_3 (node_6-node_5): length ~0.91, area=0.782 (area_id '2'), mass~0.71.\n- member_4 (node_5-node_4): length ~1.2, area=1.759 (area_id '3'), mass~2.11.\n- member_5 (node_4-node_2): length ~3.16 area=0.782 (area_id '2'), mass~2.47.\n- member_6 (node_1-node_5): length ~1.8 area=0.195 (area_id '1'), mass~0.351.\n- member_7 (node_6-node_4): length ~2.06 area=0.195 (area_id '1'), mass~0.40.\nEstimated total mass ~9.6 < 30. Estimated max stress reduced below 15 by load redistribution and member sizing.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "No duplicate nodes or members. Load and support nodes unchanged. Member areas selected from allowed set. Added one new node only. Expected stresses now within ±15. Mass well under 30. Proposed design simpler and stronger.",
