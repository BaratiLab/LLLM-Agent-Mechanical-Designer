Need redesign to reduce peak member stress and slightly reduce mass or remain safely under.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure max stress 26.21 exceeds tensile/compressive limit ±15. High stress members: member_3 (-26.21 compression), member_4 (17.64 tension), member_8 (22.58 tension). Member areas vary from 1 to 3. Current member arrangement includes intermediate nodes 7 and 8 near center. The support and load nodes fixed in position. Members 6 and 7 (connecting to node_2) are large areas (3) but with low stress (0). Overall mass is below limit but stress violation forces redesign.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce max stress by re-routing load path. Use trianges for efficient load transfer; add node or reposition node_8 to improve force direction. Avoid large compressive members by clear direct load paths. Use balanced area distribution with minimum required cross section for low stress members. Possibly remove redundant small members causing high stress concentration (like member_4, member_8).",\n  \n  "proposal": "Maintain nodes node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0). Keep node_4 (4,3) as load transfer node high enough to create triangular stable configuration. Add node_5 at (3.0,1.5) for intermediate load path. Remove node_7 and node_8 to simplify. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_2. Optimize areas using medium to smaller sizes, areas from 1 (0.195) up to 4 (3.128). This layout creates stable triangular load paths for load at node_3 downward at 45° and reduces multiple small members with overstress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular configurations transfer load effectively; avoid many members with low stress utilization but high mass. Keeping node_5 as midpoint between node_3 and node_4 helps distribute forces. Removing node_7 and node_8 reduces complexity and stress concentrations.
