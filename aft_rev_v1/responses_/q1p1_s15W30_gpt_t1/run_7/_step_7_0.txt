  "preamble": "Current structure meets constraints with minimized stress and mass within limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 7.83 well below limit ±15 and total mass 28.15 below mass limit 30. Load at node_3, supports at nodes 1, 2 fixed. Node_5 centrally placed with optimized intermediate connectivity.",
  
  "analysis": "Stress distribution is balanced; max stress member_6 at -7.8292 and other members lower. All members have suitable cross-sectional areas with no over-design. No overload or underutilization observed. Node_5 position at (3.0, 1.5) provides efficient force transfer.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further improvements to lower stress marginally would require significant redesign or node additions, increasing complexity/mass. Current design is optimal trade-off between stress and mass.",
  
  "reasoning": "Increasing areas beyond current selection increases mass above limit. Reducing areas causes stress exceedance. Node repositioning restricted for load/support nodes. Internal node 5 position already reasonable. Members connect a closed stable truss. No duplicated members or nodes observed. Constraint set is tight and current design suitably optimized.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Members areas taken from area list {'1':0.195, '2':0.782, '3':1.759, '4':3.128}. Total mass = sum(length*area) fits 28.15 <30. Max stress ±7.83 <15. Stability and statics consistent.",
  
  "calculation": "No member exceeds stress limits. Node movement limited to avoid load/support nodes changes. Mass margin to 30 is minimal. Small stress margin suggests near optimal. No promising node relocation indicated. Design iteration 6 returns closed truss with minimal stress and mass close to limit.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Stop optimization as stress and mass constraints are satisfied with balanced internal force distribution. Current node layout and member configuration efficient. Further iteration not warranted.",
