Current max stress ~39 exceeds ±15. Current mass ~15 is within limit. Design must reduce stress significantly while keeping mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has six members with areas ranging up to 4.887 and stresses up to 38.9, highest tensile and compressive beyond limits. Member_6 (node_5 to node_1) has max tension. Node_5 as intermediate is off the baseline between supports. Members connecting node_5 carry zero or low stress except member_6. Load at node_3 is applied horizontally and vertically, inducing bending and high stresses in members around node_1 and node_5. The arrangement does not distribute load well to supports. Need to improve geometry and member sizing to reduce critical stress and keep mass low.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding nodes near load or creating triangular substructures for better load path. Reduce large area members to smaller sections by improving geometry. Possibly reposition node_5 for better force flow but keep fixed nodes. Eliminate zero stress members to save mass. Increase triangulation for stability and stress distribution.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add one node between node_3 and node_4 to divide span and create a more stable triangular frame. Change members to form two interconnected triangles from node_1 to node_2 through these nodes. Adjust areas: use moderate areas (around \'2\' = 0.782, \'3\' = 1.759) for longer members, smallest areas (\'1\' = 0.195) for short braces, to reduce mass. Remove zero-stress members by design refinement.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Two triangles share load more effectively than the current open shape. Smaller cross-sectional areas on members with lower stress reduce mass without exceeding stress limits. By adding one node between node_3 (2.0,0) and node_4 (4.0,3), say at (3.0,1.5), with members connecting supports and load node through these nodes, load is better transferred. Supports remain same. Areas optimized for load carrying capacity and mass balance. Node_5 moved for optimal load path.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(4,3), node_5(3,1.5). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_1-node_5, node_5-node_2 (new). Assign areas to keep max stress ±15 and mass ≤30. Check each member\'s length and assign areas to limit stress. Reduce area in member_6 to area \'1\' or remove if stress zero. Verify mass sum length * area density ≤30.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Lengths (approximate): node_1-node_3=2.0, node_3-node_5=1.80, node_5-node_4=1.58, node_4-node_2=3.0, node_3-node_4=3.6, node_1-node_5=3.35, node_5-node_2=3.35. For areas: area \'2\' =0.782, \'3\' =1.759, \'1\' =0.195. Mass sum = Σ length*area.
