Nodes fixed for loads/supports, can add/move internal nodes for better force distribution. Max stress in iteration 3 reached 37.3 (too high); mass 12.1 under limit.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Stress peak at member_6 (node_1 to node_5) at 37.3 exceeds ±15 limit. Member areas on this path are small (area_id 1 = 0.195). Structure lacks adequate triangulation around loaded node_3, causing overload on members tied to ground. Current members mostly short, but low area leads to high stress. Need to redistribute forces with better node placement and more triangulation to share load paths. Also, increase area for critical members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Critical load from node_3 pulls down-left; node_3 at (2,0). Clearing load by adding internal nodes near load (e.g., between node_3 and higher nodes) could help. Member_6 has small cross-sectional area, increase to reduce stress. Use more triangular stability from ground to load node. Add nodes around (2.7,1.5) and (3.8,1.5).",\n  \n  "proposal": "Maintain nodes_1, _2, _3 fixed; reposition internal nodes to (3.0,1.5), (3.8,1.5) and add a new node_7 at (2.5,1.8) to triangulate near load. Connect members to form well-distributed triangulation: node_1-node_7, node_7-node_3, node_7-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_6 (3.5,1.0) if keep node_6, or remove node_6 to reduce complexity. Assign larger areas (area_id 3 or 4) to heavily loaded members connected to fixed supports. Use area_id 3 (1.759) for critical members and smaller areas for less stressed ones.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_7 near load node_3 creates shorter members to better distribute load. Increasing critical member cross-sectional areas reduces stress levels below limit. Removing node_6 from iteration 3 reduces unnecessary force path complexity and stress concentration. New triangulated connectivity ensures forces flow efficiently from load to supports.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate mass: sum(member length × area).
