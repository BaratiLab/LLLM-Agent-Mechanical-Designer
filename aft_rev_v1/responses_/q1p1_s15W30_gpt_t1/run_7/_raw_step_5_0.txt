Current max stress 19.57 > 15, mass 15.58 < 30. Members near node_3 overstressed; need better force distribution and cross-section sizing.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design iter_4 has member_7 (node_3-node_5) over stress (19.57) surpassing limit ±15. Mass within limit, so area increase can be limited. Loading on node_3 downward-left 10N at 45°. Triangulation improved vs earlier iterations but weak near load node. Node_7 between node_1 and node_3 attempts bracing but causes high stress in member_7.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress in member_7 and improve force path, add intermediate nodes closer to load, redistribute members to form multiple load paths, avoid long slender members, select area sizes carefully to balance mass and stress. Remove unstable members or reduce length where possible.",\n\n  "proposal": "Modify structure by shifting node_7 slightly closer to node_3 horizontally, add a new node_8 at (3.0, 2.3) near top between node_4 and node_5 to improve load distribution. Connect node_7 to node_8 and node_8 to node_4. Use smaller cross-sections on less stressed members and larger on critical tension members. Keep load and support node positions fixed. Adjust member areas to keep stresses below ±15.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Introducing node_8 near top triangle apex improves triangulation and distributes forces from load node_3 through multiple paths. Shortening long members reduces bending-induced stresses. Enlarging area for member_7 will reduce stress but must be balanced with other members area. Using node_7 closer to node_3 reduces length and stress in member_7. Structural stability ensured with triangulation around node_3 and node_4.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Nodes fixed: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0).
