Current geometry is a simple triangle with a vertical node_4 at (2,3).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress on member_3, add diagonal bracing or change topology to better distribute load. Possibly add node between node_3 and node_4 or add member between node_1 and node_2 to stiffen bottom chord. Keep supports and load nodes fixed. Areas can be adjusted within allowed discrete set.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node (node_5) at (4.0, 1.5) to create additional bracing. Add members: node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_5-node_3. Adjust member areas to reduce stress on critical members. Remove or reduce area of member_3 to lower its stress. Maintain existing members where possible but adjust areas.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 creates a secondary load path and reduces bending in member_3 by sharing load with node_5. Members from node_5 to nodes 2, 3, and 4 form a triangulated bracing system improving stiffness and reducing member_3 stress. Adjusting areas to mid-range values balances mass and stress.
