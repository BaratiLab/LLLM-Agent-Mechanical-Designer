Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Constraints: max stress ±15, max mass 30. Current max stress 20.15>15, mass 26.6<30. Need to reduce stress, especially member_4 (20.15) and member_3 area (4) is large mass contributor.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has member_4 overstressed at 20.15, and member_3 has large area (4) causing high mass. Member_4 connects node_2 to node_4. Node_4 is at (2,3), node_2 at (6,0). Load at node_3 (2,0) down-left. The truss topology is somewhat complex but stresses concentrate on member_4 and member_3. Member_3 connects node_1 (0,0) to node_4 (2,3). High area on member_3 suggests large force or inefficient load path. Adding node_6 (3,4) and node_5 (4,2) didn\'t reduce max stress below 15. The structure needs better force transfer paths to reduce member_4 stress and redistribute forces.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce member_4 stress, consider adding a diagonal member from node_5 or node_6 to node_2 or node_3 to share load. Possibly reduce member_3 area and add intermediate nodes to create triangulation. Keep supports and load fixed. Avoid increasing mass beyond 30. Member areas can be reduced if stress is lowered by topology changes.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node_7 near (4.0, 3.5) to form additional triangulation between node_4, node_5, node_7, and node_2. Connect node_7 to node_2 and node_5 with moderate areas to share load. Reduce member_3 area from 4 to 2 to save mass. Remove member_7 (node_5 to node_2) area 1 and replace with two smaller members through node_7 to distribute forces. This should reduce stress on member_4 and member_3 while keeping mass under 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_4 overstressed likely due to direct load path from node_2 to node_4. Adding node_7 creates alternative path to node_2, reducing stress on member_4. Reducing member_3 area saves mass, compensated by new members with smaller areas. Triangulation improves stiffness and load distribution. Member areas chosen from available set balancing stress and mass. Node positions chosen to maintain stable geometry and optimize force flow.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_4(2,3) to node_7(4,3.5) ≈ 2.06; node_7 to node_2(6,0) ≈ 3.35; node_5(4,2) to node_7(4,3.5) = 1.5. Areas: member_3 reduced 4->2; new members area 2 or 1. Mass = sum(length*area). Expected mass ~28-29 <30. Stress estimated reduced by load sharing.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Original mass: 26.6. Reduce member_3 area from 4 to 2 halves its mass from 11.28 to ~5.64. Add members: member_11 (node_4-node_7) length 2.06 area 2 mass ~4.05; member_12 (node_7-node_2) length 3.35 area 2 mass ~6.7; member_13 (node_5-node_7) length 1.5 area 1 mass 1.5. Total added mass ~12.25 - 5.64 saved = ~6.6 added, total mass ~33.2 exceeds 30. Reduce areas on new members to 1 or 0.782. With areas 1,1,0.782 mass ~2.06+3.35+1.17=6.58, still high. Use areas 1,1,0.195 for member_13 mass 0.29 total new ~5.7 total mass ~32.7. Slightly above 30, reduce member_3 area further to 1 saves 5.6 mass, net mass ~27.7. Good.
