  "preamble": "Optimize node positions to reduce max stress while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 13.06 < 15, total mass 24.11 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Nodes at load/support fixed.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is well below limit, but member_1 has high compressive stress (-13.06). Members with zero stress suggest possible redundancy or inefficient load path. Node_5 moved up to 2.5 increased stress safety margin. Node_6 and node_4 positions can be slightly adjusted to better distribute load and reduce stress on critical members. Area assignments mostly moderate; member_3 area=3 is large but stress low. Member_10 area=1 is small but stress is -8.687, moderate. Load at node_3 requires strong support from members connected to it.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing compressive stress in member_1 by slightly shifting node_3 or node_4. Node_3 fixed x=2.0,y=0.0 (load node), node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_4 can be optimized vertically or horizontally for better force distribution. Member areas can be adjusted within given discrete set if needed.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_1 (node_1-node_3) stress is highest compressive. To reduce it, reduce axial load by improving load transfer through node_4 and node_5. Slightly increasing vertical height of node_4 or adjusting node_5 horizontally can improve force distribution. Member_3 area=3 is large, stress low, so reducing area may reduce mass but may increase stress. Instead, optimize geometry first. Members with zero stress (8,9) suggest these members carry no load; possibly node_6 can be repositioned to engage these members more effectively or reduce mass by removing redundant members. However, removing members may violate closed truss constraint. Keep closed truss.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Check distances and angles: node_4 at (2,3), node_5 at (4,2.5), node_6 at (3,4). Member lengths and forces can be balanced by moving node_4 slightly right (increase x) and node_5 slightly down (reduce y) to reduce compressive stress in member_1 and tensile in member_10. Keep node_3 fixed at (2,0).",
  
  "calculation": "Adjust node_4 from (2.0, 3.0) to (2.3, 3.1), node_5 from (4.0, 2.5) to (3.8, 2.3), node_6 from (3.0, 4.0) to (3.1, 4.2). This shifts load path to reduce member_1 compression. Keep member areas same for now. Estimated mass ~24.1, max stress expected to reduce below 13.0 due to better load distribution. Members 8 and 9 now engaged with node_6 moved, reducing zero stress members. Member connectivity unchanged to keep closed truss.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Positions optimized to reduce max stress, maintain constraints, no load/support nodes moved, no duplicate members, areas unchanged. Expect stress reduction and mass within limits. Continue optimization as further minor improvements possible.",
