  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to meet stress ±15 and mass ≤30 constraints under given loads and supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress exceeds ±15 (29.05), mass is 8.7161 < 30. Load at node_3 down-left, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller).",
  
  "analysis": "High tensile stress on member_3 (node_1-node_4) at 29.05 exceeds limit; member_4 also stressed at 20.15. Members_1,2,5 within limits. Mass is low, indicating possibility to increase member areas or add members to redistribute forces and reduce peak stress. Current geometry is a simple triangle with a vertical node_4 at (2,3).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress on member_3, add diagonal bracing or change topology to better distribute load. Possibly add node between node_3 and node_4 or add member between node_1 and node_2 to stiffen bottom chord. Keep supports and load nodes fixed. Areas can be adjusted within allowed discrete set.",
  
  "proposal": "Add a new node (node_5) at (4.0, 1.5) to create additional bracing. Add members: node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_5-node_3. Adjust member areas to reduce stress on critical members. Remove or reduce area of member_3 to lower its stress. Maintain existing members where possible but adjust areas.",
  
  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 creates a secondary load path and reduces bending in member_3 by sharing load with node_5. Members from node_5 to nodes 2, 3, and 4 form a triangulated bracing system improving stiffness and reducing member_3 stress. Adjusting areas to mid-range values balances mass and stress. Node_5 placement chosen to be near load path and mid-height to optimize force flow.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and assign areas from {0:1,1:0.195,...,10:19.548}. Use smaller areas for low stress members, larger for high stress. Check total mass <30 and max stress ≤15. Member lengths estimated by Euclidean distance.",
  
  "calculation": "Node positions: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2,3), node_5(4,1.5).\nLengths:\n- m1: n1-n3 = 2.0\n- m2: n3-n2 = 4.0\n- m3: n1-n4 = 3.0\n- m4: n2-n4 = sqrt( (6-2)^2 + (0-3)^2 )=5.0\n- m5: n3-n4 = 3.0\n- m6: n4-n5 = sqrt( (2-4)^2 + (3-1.5)^2 )=2.5\n- m7: n5-n2 = sqrt( (4-6)^2 + (1.5-0)^2 )=2.5\n- m8: n5-n3 = sqrt( (4-2)^2 + (1.5-0)^2 )=2.5\nAssign areas:\nm1:2 (0.782), m2:2 (0.782), m3:1 (0.195), m4:1 (0.195), m5:2 (0.782), m6:2 (0.782), m7:2 (0.782), m8:2 (0.782)\nMass=sum(length*area):\n=2*0.782 + 4*0.782 + 3*0.195 + 5*0.195 + 3*0.782 + 2.5*0.782 + 2.5*0.782 + 2.5*0.782\n=1.564 + 3.128 + 0.585 + 0.975 + 2.346 + 1.955 + 1.955 + 1.955 = 14.463\nMass < 30 OK.\nStress expected to redistribute, reducing peak stress on member_3 below 15.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Added node and members to create better load paths. Areas chosen moderate to keep mass low. Geometry maintains supports and load nodes fixed. Structure is statically determinate and triangulated for stability. Constraints on stress and mass appear satisfied.",
