Max stress ±15, max mass 30. Current max stress 29.05 >15, mass 23.47 <30. Need to reduce stress especially on member_3 (29.05).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has high tensile stress on member_3 (node_1 to node_4). Member_3 area is 1 (0.195), quite small. Increasing area there or redistributing loads by adding members or repositioning nodes can reduce stress. Current design has many members with zero or low stress, indicating inefficient load paths. Node_7 addition did not reduce max stress. Node_4 is at (2,3), node_5 at (4,2), node_6 at (3,4), node_7 at (4,3.5).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on increasing area or adding members to reduce stress in node_1 to node_4 member. Consider moving node_5 and node_7 or removing node_7 to simplify. Possibly add diagonal members to better triangulate and redistribute load. Try increasing area of critical members selectively to reduce max stress without large mass increase.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_7 to reduce complexity and mass. Adjust node_5 to (4.0, 2.5) for better geometry. Add member between node_5 and node_2 to create better load path. Increase area of member_3 (node_1 to node_4) to 3 (1.759) to reduce stress. Use area 2 (0.782) for members carrying moderate stress and 1 (0.195) for low stress members to optimize mass. Keep other nodes fixed. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_4-node_6, node_6-node_2, node_5-node_3.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing node_7 reduces mass and complexity without losing critical load paths. Adjusting node_5 higher improves triangulation and load transfer. Increasing area of member_3 reduces tensile stress from 29 to below 15. Adding member_5-node_2 improves load distribution and reduces stress on node_3-node_2 and node_4-node_2 members. Using variable areas based on stress optimizes mass within limit. Triangulation ensures stability and load paths.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and estimate mass: member_3 length ~3.0, area 3 → mass ~5.28.
