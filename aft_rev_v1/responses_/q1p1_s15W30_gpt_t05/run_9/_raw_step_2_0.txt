Load at node_3 downward-left. Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Need stress reduction mainly in member_3 (29.05), which connects node_1 to node_4.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress violation is in member_3 (node_1 to node_4) at 29.05. This member is small area (area_id 1 = 0.195) and under tension. Other members have acceptable stresses. Mass is within limits, so increasing area in critical members is possible. Current design has node_5 added at (4,1.5) but member_3 still overloaded. Load at node_3 creates high tension in member_3. To reduce stress, redistribute forces by adding a new node higher than node_4 to create a stronger triangular bracing, or increase area of member_3. Also, members connected to node_4 can be optimized for better force distribution. Avoid increasing mass too much by selective area assignment.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding node_6 above node_4 at (3.0, 4.0) to create two new members: node_4 to node_6 and node_6 to node_2 or node_5, redistributing load. Increase area of member_3 from 1 to 3 or 4. Use area 3 (1.759) or 4 (3.128) for critical members. Members with low stress can have smaller area. Remove or replace redundant members with zero stress. Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Adjust node_5 position slightly upward to reduce bending.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_6 at (3.0, 4.0). Modify members: increase area of member_3 to 4 (3.128). Add members node_4-node_6 (area 2), node_6-node_2 (area 2), remove member_8 (node_5-node_3) zero stress. Adjust node_5 to (4.0, 2.0) for better load path. Maintain existing supports and load nodes. Reassign areas: member_1 and member_2 to 2 (0.782), member_4 and member_7 to 1 (0.195), member_5 and member_6 to 2 (0.782).",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing area of member_3 reduces its stress. Adding node_6 creates a more stable truss with additional load paths, reducing stress on member_3 and others. Adjusting node_5 upward improves force distribution and reduces bending. Removing zero-stress member reduces unnecessary mass. Using smaller areas on low-stress members saves mass. This approach balances stress and mass within constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_1-node_4 ~3.0, node_4-node_6 = 1.0, node_6-node_2 ~3.16, node_5 adjusted from y=1.5 to y=2.0.
