  "preamble": "Current truss meets constraints with moderate max stress and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective to minimize stress under ±15 with mass ≤ 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Nodes for load/support fixed; only free nodes can move.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is 13.51 < 15, total mass 24.3 < 30. All constraints satisfied. Stress distribution is balanced, no member near limit. Free nodes (4,5,6) adjusted to reduce stress from prior iterations.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress mostly compressive in member_1 (-13.5), tensile stresses low. Member areas mostly moderate (1 to 3). No overstressed members. Mass well below max.",
  
  "reasoning": "Further stress reduction likely marginal given current balanced configuration. Moving free nodes further risks increasing stress elsewhere or violating geometry. Member areas selected appropriately to balance mass and stress. Closed 2D truss maintained with no duplicates.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Areas chosen from allowed set; no need to increase areas to reduce stress. Node positions of load/support fixed; free nodes well positioned for load path. Member connectivity consistent and redundant for stability.",
  
  "calculation": "Total mass = 24.3014 < 30, max stress = 13.51 < 15. Member stresses within limits. No member area exceeds necessity. Node positions precise and valid. No duplicate nodes or members.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met, no significant improvement possible without violating constraints or geometry. Optimization should stop.",
