Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved from (2.5,3.0) to (3,3.5) improved mass and stress. Members use areas 0,2,3. Objective: reduce max stress further without exceeding mass or changing load/support nodes.",\n  "analysis": "Max compressive stress is on member_1 (-11.11), tensile max on member_3 (7.94). Member_1 area is smallest (1), members 3 and 4 have moderate areas (0.782 and 1.759). Increasing area on member_1 may reduce stress but increase mass. Moving node_4 affects geometry and internal forces. Current geometry is nearly optimal but slight adjustments to node_4 position could balance forces better and reduce peak stress. Also, adjusting member areas to better match force demand can help.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_4 slightly closer to node_3 horizontally to reduce member_1 compression. Possibly increase member_1 area from 0(1) to 1(0.195) or 2(0.782) to reduce stress. Reduce member_5 area from 3(1.759) to 2(0.782) to save mass if stress allows. Check if mass remains <30.",\n  "reasoning": "Member_1 has highest compressive stress, so increasing its area reduces stress. But area 1 is smallest, so increase from 1 to 0.782 or 1.759 may help. Member_5 has moderate compressive stress (-4.18), reducing its area may save mass. Node_4 moved slightly left and down to reduce tension in member_3 and compression in member_1.
