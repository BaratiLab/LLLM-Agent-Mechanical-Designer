Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved from (3.0,3.5) to (2.8,3.2) reduced mass and stress but stress still near limit.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max compressive stress on member_1 (-14.317) is critical. Members connected to node_4 carry moderate stress. Node_4 position affects force distribution and member lengths. Reducing stress on member_1 by adjusting node_4 position and possibly changing area assignments can improve design.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member areas currently mostly \'2\' (0.782) except member_2 is \'0\' (1). Member_1 stress is highest compressive, member_3 highest tensile. Node_4 moved closer to node_3 horizontally and slightly lower vertically compared to last iteration. Need to try small adjustments to node_4 to reduce stress on member_1.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 slightly left and down may reduce axial compression in member_1 by redistributing forces. Maintaining node_3 at (2,0) and supports fixed. Member_2 area \'0\' (1) is largest, keeping it as is to maintain stiffness. Areas of other members kept at \'2\' for lightness. Slightly lowering node_4 y-coordinate may reduce tensile stress in member_3 and compressive in member_1. Verify no overlap or invalid geometry.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_4 at (2.8,3.2). Try (2.65,3.0). Member lengths: m1 ~ distance(node_1,node_3)=2.0, m3 ~ distance(node_1,node_4), m5 ~ distance(node_3,node_4). Area assignments: keep as is. Calculate approximate effect on stress: lowering node_4 decreases member_3 length and may reduce tensile stress; member_1 unaffected in length but force distribution changes.",\n  \n  "calculation": "New node_4: (2.65, 3.0). Member lengths update: m3 length ~ sqrt((2.65)^2 + 3^2) ≈ 4.05, slightly less than before. Member_5 length ~ sqrt((2.65-2)^2 + 3^2) ≈ 3.02, slightly less. With these, expected member_3 and member_5 stresses reduce slightly. Member_1 stress expected to reduce due to load redistribution. Total mass recalculated: sum(member_length × area factor).
