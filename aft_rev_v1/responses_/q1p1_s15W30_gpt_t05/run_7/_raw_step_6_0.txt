Current max stress 14.07 near limit, mass 14.6 well below limit.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has max stress close to limit mostly in member_1 (-14.07). Member areas mostly \'2\' or \'0\'. Node_4 position affects stress distribution significantly. Load and supports fixed, node_3 and nodes 1,2 fixed. Node_4 moved in history to try reducing stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 is critical, compressive stress near limit. Slightly reducing stress in member_1 may improve safety. Node_4 moved back to (2.5,3.0) from previous attempts at higher/lower y. Member_2 area is \'0\' (area=1), could consider increasing area to reduce stress if needed.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "To reduce max compressive stress in member_1, can try to slightly raise node_4 to redistribute forces, or slightly shift node_4 horizontally to balance load paths. Increasing area of member_1 or member_5 would reduce stress but increase mass. Mass is well below limit, some area increase possible. Keep member_2 area low to save mass. Aim to keep member_1 compressive stress just below 14.0. Node_4 position adjustment is the only free variable to reduce stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: m1 ~ distance(node_1-node_3)=2.0, m3 ~ distance(node_1-node_4)=sqrt(2.5²+3.0²)=3.905, m5 ~ distance(node_3-node_4)=sqrt((2.5-2)^2+3^2)=3.04. Mass proportional to length × area. Increasing area of member_1 from \'2\' (0.782) to \'3\' (1.759) doubles mass of m1 but reduces stress. Node_4 y can be increased slightly to reduce compression in member_1.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Shift node_4 vertically from 3.0 to 3.2 and slightly horizontally from 2.5 to 2.6 to reduce compression in member_1. Increase area of member_1 from \'2\' to \'3\' to reduce stress safely. Keep other members as is. Estimate mass increase: member_1 length 2.0 × area 1.759 = 3.518 (previously 1.564). Total mass ~14.6 -1.564 +3.518 = 16.55 < 30 limit. Stress in member_1 expected to drop below 14.
