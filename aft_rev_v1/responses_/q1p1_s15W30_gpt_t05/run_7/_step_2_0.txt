  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position and member areas to reduce max stress while keeping mass under limit.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 11.11 < 15, total mass 19.61 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved from (2.5,3.0) to (3,3.5) improved mass and stress. Members use areas 0,2,3. Objective: reduce max stress further without exceeding mass or changing load/support nodes.",
  "analysis": "Max compressive stress is on member_1 (-11.11), tensile max on member_3 (7.94). Member_1 area is smallest (1), members 3 and 4 have moderate areas (0.782 and 1.759). Increasing area on member_1 may reduce stress but increase mass. Moving node_4 affects geometry and internal forces. Current geometry is nearly optimal but slight adjustments to node_4 position could balance forces better and reduce peak stress. Also, adjusting member areas to better match force demand can help.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_4 slightly closer to node_3 horizontally to reduce member_1 compression. Possibly increase member_1 area from 0(1) to 1(0.195) or 2(0.782) to reduce stress. Reduce member_5 area from 3(1.759) to 2(0.782) to save mass if stress allows. Check if mass remains <30.",
  "reasoning": "Member_1 has highest compressive stress, so increasing its area reduces stress. But area 1 is smallest, so increase from 1 to 0.782 or 1.759 may help. Member_5 has moderate compressive stress (-4.18), reducing its area may save mass. Node_4 moved slightly left and down to reduce tension in member_3 and compression in member_1. Maintain closed truss shape and no change to load/support nodes.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Mass = sum(length_i * area_i). Lengths: member_1 ~2.0, member_3 ~3.0, member_5 ~3.6 approx. Increase member_1 area to 2(0.782) mass ~1.56 added, reduce member_5 area to 2(0.782) mass ~2.8 reduced, net mass reduced. Node_4 moved from (3.0,3.5) to (2.8,3.2) to balance forces. Check stresses expected to reduce max compressive stress <11.",
  "calculation": "Updated node_4 to (2.8, 3.2). Member areas: member_1 area_id='2' (0.782), member_2 '0'(1), member_3 '2'(0.782), member_4 '2'(0.782), member_5 '2'(0.782). Approximate mass: member_1 length ~2.0 *0.782=1.56, member_2 length ~4.0*1=4, member_3 length ~3.2*0.782=2.5, member_4 length ~3.2*0.782=2.5, member_5 length ~3.6*0.782=2.8. Total ~13.36 <19.6 previous and <30 limit. Expected max stress reduced due to increased areas and better geometry.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved to (2.8,3.2) to reduce member_1 compression and member_3 tension. Member_1 area increased to 2, others adjusted to 2 except member_2 at 0. Mass well below limit, max stress expected below 11.11. Load and supports unchanged. Structure remains closed with no duplicate nodes or members.",
