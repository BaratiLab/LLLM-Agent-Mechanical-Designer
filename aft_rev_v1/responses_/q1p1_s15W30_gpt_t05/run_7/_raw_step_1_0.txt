Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Max stress Â±15, max mass 30. Current mass 30.49 > 30, max stress 11 < 15. Need to reduce mass slightly and maintain stress within limits.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has a top node_4 at (2.5,3.0) connecting to supports and load node. Members have areas 0,3,4. Member_5 with largest area 4 (3.128) has compressive stress -2.29, member_3 and member_4 tensile but low stress. Mass slightly above limit due to heavy top chord members. Load is diagonal downward, so tension/compression expected in diagonals. Reducing area on less stressed members or slightly repositioning node_4 to optimize force distribution can reduce mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Removing member_5 or reducing its area may increase stress elsewhere. Moving node_4 slightly right and up may improve force distribution. Consider reducing member_4 area from 3 (1.759) to 2 (0.782) and member_3 similarly. Maintain member_1 and member_2 at area 0 (1.0) for axial support.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep nodes_1,2,3 fixed. Move node_4 to (3.0, 3.5) to improve force triangle geometry. Reduce member_3 and member_4 areas to \'2\' (0.782) from \'3\'. Keep member_5 at area \'3\' (1.759) instead of \'4\'. Keep member_1 and member_2 at area \'0\' (1.0). This reduces mass and balances stresses.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing height of node_4 increases leverage, reducing axial forces in bottom chords. Reducing member areas on lightly stressed members reduces mass. Member_5 area reduced to lower mass but still provides diagonal bracing. Member_1 and member_2 must remain at area 0 to carry axial loads. This configuration balances mass under 30 and max stress under 15.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: member_1: node_1(0,0) to node_3(2,0) = 2.0; member_2: node_3(2,0) to node_2(6,0) = 4.0; member_3: node_1(0,0) to node_4(3,3.5) = sqrt(3^2 + 3.5^2)=4.6098; member_4: node_2(6,0) to node_4(3,3.5)=4.6098; member_5: node_3(2,0) to node_4(3,3.5)=sqrt(1^2 + 3.5^2)=3.6401.
