Load at node_3; supports fixed. Node_4 moved previously to reduce stress. Member_1 area increased from 2 to 3 to reduce stress.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress reduced significantly by increasing area of member_1 and moving node_4 higher and right. Member_5 still has high compressive stress (-9.2). Member_3 and member_4 tensile stresses moderate (~7.7 and 4.4). Mass increased but well below limit. To further reduce max stress, redistribute forces by adjusting node_4 position slightly and possibly reduce member_1 area back to 2 to save mass if stress still acceptable.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 area 3 (1.759) increased mass but reduced stress from -14 to -6.2. Member_5 compressive stress still high at -9.2. Node_4 at (2.6,3.2) higher than before; maybe slight horizontal shift can improve force distribution.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_1 carries large compressive force; increasing area helped. Member_5 compressive stress near max but acceptable. Moving node_4 slightly left or down may reduce stress in member_5 by changing angles and force paths. Member_2 area is zero with max stress -2.5, no need to increase. Aim to keep areas minimal to reduce mass but keep stresses <15. Current design is good but small tuning of node_4 may reduce max stress further.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Try moving node_4 left from 2.6 to ~2.5 and slightly down from 3.2 to ~3.0 to balance forces. Keep member_1 area at 3 to maintain low stress there. Members 3,4,5 area 2 seems balanced. Member_2 area 0 is sufficient. Check if max stress reduces below 9 and mass stays below 17.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node_4 from (2.6,3.2) to (2.5,3.0). Member areas: member_1: 3, member_2:0, member_3:2, member_4:2, member_5:2. Expected member_1 stress ~ -6, member_5 stress may reduce below -9, total mass ~16.5. This reduces max stress further and mass remains within limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "This small adjustment should improve stress distribution and keep mass low. No new nodes or members added.
