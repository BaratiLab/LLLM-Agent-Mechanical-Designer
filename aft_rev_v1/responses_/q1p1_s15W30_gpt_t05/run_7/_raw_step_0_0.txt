Objective: closed truss means all nodes connected forming at least one closed loop.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Load at node_3 down-left. To form closed truss, add at least one node above x-axis to form a triangle. Triangles are stable and minimal for closed loops. Adding node_4 above node_3 to form triangle (node_1, node_2, node_4) with node_3 connected inside or on base line. But node_3 is on base line and loaded. Better to form triangle (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_3, node_2, node_4) so node_3 is connected in closed loop.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2.5, 3.0) approx to keep structure compact and reduce member length. Members: (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), (node_1-node_4), (node_2-node_4), (node_3-node_4). This forms a closed quadrilateral with diagonal. Use smaller areas on base members to save mass, larger areas on diagonals to reduce stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Assumptions: linear elastic, axial loading only. Stress = Force / Area. Force in members estimated by static equilibrium. Mass proportional to sum(length × area). Use areas from given discrete set. Estimate member forces by resolving vertical load at node_3, distribute forces in diagonals. Keep max stress ≤15 by choosing adequate areas. Use small areas on compression members with low force, larger areas on tension members with higher force. Approximate length with Euclidean distance.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_3=2.0, node_3-node_2=4.0, node_1-node_4=√(2.5²+3²)=3.905, node_2-node_4=√(3.5²+3²)=4.609, node_3-node_4=3.0. Assign areas: base members (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2) area=1 (smallest), diagonals area=3.128 or 4.887 for higher strength. Calculate mass: sum(length*area). Check mass ≤30. Estimate forces by static equilibrium: vertical load -10N at node_3 splits into diagonals and base members. Assume diagonals carry tension, base members compression.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Mass = (2*1)+(4*1)+(3.905*3.128)+(4.609*3.128)+(3*4.887) = 2+4+12.22+14.41+14.66=47.29 >30 too heavy. Reduce diagonal areas to 1.759 and 1.759: Mass = 2+4+(3.905*1.759)+(4.609*1.759)+(3*1.759)=6 + 6.87 + 8.11 + 5.28 = 26.26 ≤30. Approximate member forces: vertical load 10N resolved in diagonals: each diagonal ~7N tension, base members ~5N compression.
