  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max compressive stress in member_1.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress is near limit in member_1 (-14.75 vs -15 allowed). Total mass well below max (14.34 vs 30). Node_1 and Node_2 fixed due to supports; Node_3 fixed due to load. Only Node_4 can move. Areas mostly area_id '2' (0.782) except member_2 (area_id '0' = 1).",
  
  "analysis": "Member_1 is highly stressed in compression close to limit. Member_3 tension is moderate (~8.3). Members 4 and 5 have lower stress. Mass is low, so some adjustment possible. Moving Node_4 slightly to reduce member_1 compression might help. Member_2 area is largest (1), others are 0.782. Member_2 stress is low (-2.7), could reduce area to save mass but mass is already low. Better to focus on geometry to reduce max stress.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider raising Node_4 slightly or shifting horizontally to reduce compression in member_1. Check effect on member_3 and member_5 stresses. Keep truss closed with 5 members. No change to load/support nodes. Avoid increasing member lengths excessively to keep mass low.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_1 connects node_1(0,0) to node_3(2,0). High compression likely due to geometry and load at node_3. Node_4 currently at (2.7, 2.85). Moving Node_4 closer to node_3 horizontally might reduce compression in member_1 by changing force distribution. Also, slightly raising node_4 can reduce compression in member_1 but must not increase tension in member_3 excessively. Member areas fixed except member_2 which is largest. Since mass is low, area changes are less critical now.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Try moving Node_4 from (2.7, 2.85) to (2.5, 3.0) or (2.6, 3.1) to check effect on stresses. Keep members and areas same. Calculate member lengths and estimate stress impact qualitatively. Member_1 length fixed (node_1 to node_3 fixed). Member_3 length changes with Node_4 position. Member_5 (node_3 to node_4) length changes too.",
  
  "calculation": "Current member lengths: member_1: node_1 to node_3 = 2m; member_3: node_1 to node_4 approx sqrt(2.7^2 + 2.85^2) ~3.92m; member_5: node_3 to node_4 approx sqrt((2.7-2)^2 + 2.85^2) ~2.91m. Moving Node_4 to (2.5, 3.0): member_3 length ~ sqrt(2.5^2 + 3^2)=3.91m, member_5 length ~ sqrt((2.5-2)^2 + 3^2)=3.04m. Slight increase in member_5 length, member_3 length similar. This may redistribute forces to reduce compression in member_1. Mass remains similar. Stress likely reduced in member_1.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Move Node_4 to (2.5, 3.0), keep all members and areas same. Expect max stress reduction in member_1 below 14.75. Mass remains well below limit. Stop only if stress close to limit cannot be reduced further in next iterations.",
