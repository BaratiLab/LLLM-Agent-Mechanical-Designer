Load at node_3, supports fixed. Current max stress ~9.17, total mass ~16.56, well within constraints.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has max stress significantly below the allowable Â±15 and mass less than half the limit of 30. Member areas and node placements are balanced. Attempts to reduce stress further by moving node_4 or changing areas previously led to higher stress or mass. Load and supports fixed, node_3 position fixed due to load.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further node movement of node_4 towards node_3 or base nodes risks increasing stress or mass. Member areas are already optimized to balance stress and mass. No duplicate members or nodes present.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Given max stress is well below limits and mass is low, further optimization will yield diminishing returns or violate constraints. Node_4 position at (2.5, 3.0) provides good triangulation and load transfer. Member areas chosen to balance stress distribution. No evident benefit in changing node_4 position or member areas further.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Checked history: increasing node_4 height increased stress; lowering decreased stiffness. Area \'3\' on member_1 reduces stress well. Member_2 area \'0\' minimal to reduce mass and stress. Members 3,4,5 with area \'2\' balance load paths. Calculations show current max stress ~9.17 < 15 and mass ~16.56 < 30.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths and areas checked: member_1 length ~2.0, area 1.759; member_2 length ~4.0, area 1; members 3,4,5 lengths ~3.0-3.5, area 0.782. Mass sums to 16.555. Stress distribution balanced with max tensile 7.85 and compressive -9.17, both within limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met, no duplicate nodes/members, load/support nodes fixed, node positions precise.
