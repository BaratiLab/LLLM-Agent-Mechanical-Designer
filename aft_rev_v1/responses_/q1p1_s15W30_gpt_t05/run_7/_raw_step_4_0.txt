Mass 14.61 well below 30. Load at node_3 fixed, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_4 can be moved.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max compressive stress is at member_1 (-14.37) and tensile at member_3 (8.04). Member_1 is highly stressed. Member areas mostly at \'2\' (0.782) except member_2 at \'0\' (1). Member_2 stress is low (-2.63). Node_4 moved closer to node_3 in last step lowered mass and stress but stress still near limit. Further moving node_4 to optimize force distribution is possible.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing height of node_4 might reduce bending in members 3 and 4, but might increase stress in member_1. Moving node_4 slightly right or left could balance stresses. Member areas fixed at \'2\' except member_2 at \'0\'.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "To reduce max compressive stress in member_1, reduce axial force by adjusting node_4 position to redistribute load paths. Slightly lowering node_4 or shifting horizontally can reduce tension/compression in members 1 and 3. Member_5 stress is moderate (-9.25). Keeping member areas same to avoid mass increase. Avoid increasing member_2 area to keep mass low.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Consider node_4 x between 2.6 and 2.7 and y between 2.8 and 3.0. Keep node_3 at (2.0, 0.0).

This slightly raises node_4 vertically and shifts horizontally right to balance forces. Member lengths: member_1 ≈ sqrt((2.7)^2 + (2.85)^2) ≈ 3.93, member_3 similar length, member_5 length ~ sqrt((0.7)^2 + (2.85)^2) ≈ 2.95.
