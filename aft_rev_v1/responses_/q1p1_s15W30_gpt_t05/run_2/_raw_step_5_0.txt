Current max stress 58.11 > 15, mass 16.95 < 30. Need stress reduction mainly in members 5, 8, 9, 3.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high tensile/compressive stress in members 5 (-40.3), 8 (-58.1), 9 (49.8), and 3 (29.8). Mass is acceptable but stress far exceeds limits. Members 8 and 9 connected to node_6 cause stress concentration. Node_6 placement at (2.0,4.0) may be causing load path inefficiency. Members 3 and 5 with low area also highly stressed. The structure is over-stressed likely due to long slender members and insufficient triangulation or inefficient force paths.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, increase triangulation, shorten long members, redistribute load paths, and adjust cross-sectional areas. Avoid increasing mass beyond 30. Consider removing node_6 or repositioning it to reduce stress in members 8 and 9. Possibly add a new node to improve load distribution. Maintain fixed nodes 1, 2, 3. Use areas from given set with preference for smaller areas except where needed for high stress.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_6 to reduce complexity and stress concentration. Add a new node_6 at (3.0, 2.5) to create better triangulation. Connect node_6 with nodes 4 and 5 to form a stiffer triangular substructure. Use members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_5, node_4-node_5, node_3-node_4, node_3-node_6, node_4-node_6, node_5-node_6. Assign moderate areas to high stress members and small areas to low stress members to reduce mass and stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing original node_6 eliminates high stress members 8 and 9. New node_6 at (3.0, 2.5) is closer to load and supports, improving force transfer. Triangulation with nodes 4, 5, 6 reduces bending and distributes load better. Areas selected to keep stress within ±15 and total mass below 30. Members spanning base (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2) kept at area 2 for stiffness. Vertical/horizontal members at area 1 or 2 depending on stress. Diagonal members supporting load at area 3 or 4 as needed.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths and estimate stresses: base members ~2m length, vertical ~3.6m, diagonals ~1.8-2.5m.
