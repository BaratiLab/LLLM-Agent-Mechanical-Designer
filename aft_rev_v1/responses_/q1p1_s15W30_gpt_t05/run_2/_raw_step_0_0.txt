To form closed truss, add at least one new node above x-axis to create a triangle or polygon. Load at node_3 downward-left at 45°. Supports at ends. To minimize stress and mass, keep truss simple (triangle). Use members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_2, and add node_4 above node_3 to form two triangles sharing node_3, distributing load.
