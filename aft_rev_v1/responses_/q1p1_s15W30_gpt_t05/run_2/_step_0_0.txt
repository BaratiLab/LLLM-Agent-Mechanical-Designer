  "preamble": "Optimize a closed 2D truss with fixed nodes under load and supports, minimizing stress within ±15 and mass ≤30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given 3 nodes with node_3 loaded (-10 at -45°), supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Need closed truss, so all nodes connected forming at least one closed loop. Max stress ±15, max mass 30. Areas discrete from given set. Nodes fixed except possibility to add new nodes to close truss.",
  
  "analysis": "Current nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). All on x-axis, so no closed polygon. To form closed truss, add at least one new node above x-axis to create a triangle or polygon. Load at node_3 downward-left at 45°. Supports at ends. To minimize stress and mass, keep truss simple (triangle). Use members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_2, and add node_4 above node_3 to form two triangles sharing node_3, distributing load. Node_4 coordinates optimized for minimal stress and mass. Member areas chosen to keep stress ≤15 and mass ≤30. Approximate member forces by static equilibrium and truss method assumptions. Use trigonometry to find lengths and angles. Use given area set for sizing.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) to form triangle node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_3-node_2-node_4. Members: (1-3), (3-2), (1-2), (1-4), (3-4), (2-4). Calculate lengths and approximate forces from equilibrium. Assign areas to keep stress ≤15. Sum mass = length*area ≤30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Adding node_4 above node_3 forms two triangles sharing node_3, improving load distribution. Members connect all nodes, ensuring closed structure. The load at node_3 acts diagonally, so members connected to node_3 and node_4 help resist it in tension/compression. Member 1-2 is base, carries compression. Areas chosen larger for members under higher stress. Approximate forces by method of joints. Use length and area to estimate mass. Keep areas minimal to reduce mass but enough to keep stress ≤15.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: 1-2 = 6.0, 1-3 = 2.0, 3-2 = 4.0, 1-4 = sqrt((2-0)^2+(3-0)^2)=3.6056, 3-4=3.0, 2-4=sqrt((6-2)^2+(0-3)^2)=5.0 approx. Assume axial forces from equilibrium at node_3 and node_4. Stress = Force/Area. Force approx from load distribution. Choose areas from set to keep stress ≤15. Mass=sum(length*area).",
