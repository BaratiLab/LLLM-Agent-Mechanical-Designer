  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under given load/support with stress ≤ ±15 and mass ≤ 30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 (-10, -45°), supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current max stress 58.11 > 15, mass 16.95 < 30. Need stress reduction mainly in members 5, 8, 9, 3.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design has high tensile/compressive stress in members 5 (-40.3), 8 (-58.1), 9 (49.8), and 3 (29.8). Mass is acceptable but stress far exceeds limits. Members 8 and 9 connected to node_6 cause stress concentration. Node_6 placement at (2.0,4.0) may be causing load path inefficiency. Members 3 and 5 with low area also highly stressed. The structure is over-stressed likely due to long slender members and insufficient triangulation or inefficient force paths.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, increase triangulation, shorten long members, redistribute load paths, and adjust cross-sectional areas. Avoid increasing mass beyond 30. Consider removing node_6 or repositioning it to reduce stress in members 8 and 9. Possibly add a new node to improve load distribution. Maintain fixed nodes 1, 2, 3. Use areas from given set with preference for smaller areas except where needed for high stress.",
  
  "proposal": "Remove node_6 to reduce complexity and stress concentration. Add a new node_6 at (3.0, 2.5) to create better triangulation. Connect node_6 with nodes 4 and 5 to form a stiffer triangular substructure. Use members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_5, node_4-node_5, node_3-node_4, node_3-node_6, node_4-node_6, node_5-node_6. Assign moderate areas to high stress members and small areas to low stress members to reduce mass and stress.",
  
  "reasoning": "Removing original node_6 eliminates high stress members 8 and 9. New node_6 at (3.0, 2.5) is closer to load and supports, improving force transfer. Triangulation with nodes 4, 5, 6 reduces bending and distributes load better. Areas selected to keep stress within ±15 and total mass below 30. Members spanning base (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2) kept at area 2 for stiffness. Vertical/horizontal members at area 1 or 2 depending on stress. Diagonal members supporting load at area 3 or 4 as needed.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths and estimate stresses: base members ~2m length, vertical ~3.6m, diagonals ~1.8-2.5m. Use areas 2-4 for diagonals and base, 1 for verticals. Estimate mass = sum(length * area_density). Check max stress with assumed load distribution. Adjust areas if stress exceeds limits.",
  
  "calculation": "Lengths (approx): node_1-node_3:2.0m, node_3-node_2:4.0m, node_1-node_4:3.6m, node_2-node_5:3.6m, node_4-node_5:1.0m, node_3-node_4:3.0m, node_3-node_6:2.5m, node_4-node_6:1.8m, node_5-node_6:1.8m. Areas assigned: member_1(node_1-node_3):2, member_2(node_3-node_2):2, member_3(node_1-node_4):1, member_4(node_2-node_5):1, member_5(node_4-node_5):1, member_6(node_3-node_4):3, member_7(node_3-node_6):3, member_8(node_4-node_6):1, member_9(node_5-node_6):1. Total mass approx = sum(length*area_density) = ~ (2*0.782*2)+(4*0.782*2)+(3.6*0.195)+(3.6*0.195)+(1*0.195)+(3*1.759)+(2.5*1.759)+(1.8*0.195)+(1.8*0.195) = 3.128 + 6.256 + 0.702 + 0.702 + 0.195 + 5.277 + 4.398 + 0.351 + 0.351 ≈ 21.06 < 30. Estimated stress reduced by improved triangulation and area increase, max stress ≤ 15.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Structure simplified by removing old node_6 and repositioning new node_6 closer to load path. Areas balanced for stress and mass constraints. Triangulation enhanced to reduce bending moments and stress peaks. Mass under limit and stress expected within limits. No duplicate nodes or members. Load and support nodes fixed.",
