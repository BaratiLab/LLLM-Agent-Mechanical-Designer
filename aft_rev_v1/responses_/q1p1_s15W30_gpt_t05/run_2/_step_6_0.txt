  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to meet stress ±15 and mass ≤30 with given loads and supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 (-10, -45°), supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current max stress 29.82 exceeds ±15 limit. Mass 18.2252 is within 30. Need to reduce stress by redesigning members and areas.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design has high stress in member_3 (node_1-node_4) and member_4 (node_2-node_5) near 15 limit but member_3 exceeds it. Members with area 3 (1.759) on members_6 and 7 cause high mass and some stress. Triangular bracing with nodes 4,5,6 is dense but stress not well distributed. Member lengths and areas can be optimized. Node_6 moved closer to center but stress still high. Current topology is complex; simpler triangulation with better load path can reduce stress.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider removing node_6 to reduce complexity and redistribute forces. Increase areas on critical members with moderate length, reduce areas on less stressed members. Move nodes 4 and 5 slightly for better geometry. Use areas mostly 2 or 3 for main chords and 1 for bracing. Avoid large areas like 4 or more to keep mass low.",
  
  "proposal": "Remove node_6. Keep nodes 1,2,3 fixed. Place node_4 at (2.7, 3.5), node_5 at (3.7, 3.5) for symmetric top chord. Members: node_1-node_3 (area 2), node_3-node_2 (area 2), node_1-node_4 (area 2), node_2-node_5 (area 2), node_4-node_5 (area 1), node_3-node_4 (area 3), node_3-node_5 (area 2). This simpler triangulated design improves load paths and reduces stress concentration.",
  
  "reasoning": "Removing node_6 reduces member complexity and potential stress concentrations. Symmetric top chord nodes 4 and 5 provide stable load transfer. Using area 3 on critical diagonal (3-4) supports tension/compression. Areas 2 on main chords provide sufficient capacity without excess mass. Area 1 on top chord (4-5) reduces mass. This layout balances mass and stress constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: 1-3 ~2.0, 3-2 ~4.0, 1-4 ~4.3, 2-5 ~3.7, 4-5 ~1.0, 3-4 ~3.2, 3-5 ~2.7. Approx mass: sum(length × area) with areas from given set. Stress expected <15 by improved geometry and area distribution.",
  
  "calculation": "Mass estimate: (1-3)2.0×0.782=1.56, (3-2)4.0×0.782=3.13, (1-4)4.3×0.782=3.36, (2-5)3.7×0.782=2.89, (4-5)1.0×0.195=0.195, (3-4)3.2×1.759=5.63, (3-5)2.7×0.782=2.11. Total ~18.8 <30. Stress reduced by balanced triangulation and areas. Max stress expected <15.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Design meets mass constraint and expected stress <15. Nodes 1,2,3 fixed per instructions. No duplicate members. Areas chosen from allowed set. Geometry optimized for load path and stress distribution.",
