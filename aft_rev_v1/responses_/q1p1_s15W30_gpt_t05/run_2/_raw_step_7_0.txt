Mass is well below max. Nodes 4 and 5 placed symmetrically at (2.7,3.5) and (3.7,3.5) with appropriate member areas. Load at node_3 and supports at nodes 1 and 2 fixed. Members connecting load/support nodes have reduced stress. No member exceeds stress or mass constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further movement of nodes 4 and 5 risks increasing stress or mass. Current layout balances load path well. Member areas chosen to keep stress low without excess mass. Closed truss with 7 members is stable and efficient.",\n  "reasoning": "Reducing max stress below 13.81 further would require either increasing cross-sectional areas (increasing mass) or repositioning nodes 4 and 5, which risks violating constraints or losing stability. Current design uses area \'2\' and \'3\' efficiently. Members near load have moderate stress, others low. Symmetry and geometry optimize force distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas produce member masses summing to 20.94. Member stresses all within limits. No need to add or remove members. Node repositioning constrained by fixed load/support nodes.
