    "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under load with stress and mass constraints.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 downward-left; supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Max stress ±15, max mass 30. Current max stress 29.05 > 15, mass 13.4 < 30. Need to reduce stress mostly on member_4 and member_6, which exceed tensile limit.",
    
    "analysis": "Current design has node_4 at (2,3) causing high stress in members connecting node_4 to node_1 and node_2. Member_4 (node_1-node_4) has 29.05 stress, member_6 (node_2-node_4) has 20.15 stress. Members between node_1, node_2, and node_3 have lower stresses. Load at node_3 creates bending moment causing high tension in diagonal members. To reduce stress, better triangulation and load path needed. Possibly move node_4 higher and slightly right to better distribute forces. Also, adjust cross-sectional areas to reduce stress. Use larger area for high load members and smaller for low stressed.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding one more node above node_3 to form two triangles sharing load better. Increase area for members carrying tension, reduce for compression. Avoid large eccentricities causing bending. Keep node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_3 fixed at (2,0). Node_4 moved to optimize geometry.",
    
    "proposal": "Add node_5 at (3.5, 3.5) to improve triangulation. Move node_4 to (2.5, 3.5). Members: connect node_1-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_3-node_5, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_2-node_5. Assign areas to reduce stress: high area for members under tension (diagonals), smaller for compression (bottom chords). Remove member_3 (node_1-node_2) to reduce compression path and redistribute forces through upper nodes.",
    
    "reasoning": "Adding node_5 creates a better triangulated structure distributing load from node_3 through two paths to supports. Moving node_4 slightly right and higher aligns members closer to load vector, reducing bending moments. Removing node_1-node_2 member reduces unnecessary compression member. Assigning larger cross-sectional areas to high tension members reduces stress. Using smaller areas on low stress members reduces mass. Overall mass remains <30, stresses kept within ±15 by geometry and area adjustment.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths, estimate forces using method of joints approximate, assign areas from given set. Check max stress = force / (area). Use areas: tension members area 6 or 7 (~7 to 9.5), compression members area 1 or 2 (~0.195 to 0.78). Verify total mass = sum(length * area) < 30. Verify max stress < 15.",
