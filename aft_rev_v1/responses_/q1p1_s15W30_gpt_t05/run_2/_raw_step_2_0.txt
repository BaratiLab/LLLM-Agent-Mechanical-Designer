Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Current max stress 29.7 > 15, mass 14.8 < 30. Need to reduce stress, possibly by redistributing load paths or increasing members\' capacity.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has high stress on member_7 (node_1-node_4) and member_1 (node_1-node_3). Members with area 2 (0.782) are stressed beyond limits. The top chord (node_4-node_5) is small area 1 (0.195) but has moderate stress. The structure is slightly asymmetric with node_5 at (3.5,3.5). The load is applied at node_3 (2,0), which is low and near supports. Member_7 is highly stressed likely due to direct load transfer from node_3 to node_1 via node_4. The load path can be improved by adding a vertical node above node_3 to better distribute forces. The mass is under limit, so increasing some member sizes or adding members is feasible.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding a vertical node above node_3 to form a truss triangle, remove or replace member_7 with better load path. Increase areas on critical members. Keep supports fixed. Avoid overlong members. Use area sizes 2 (0.782) or 3 (1.759) for critical members.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_6 above node_3 at (2.0, 4.0). Remove member_7 (node_1-node_4). Add members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_6, node_3-node_6, node_5-node_6. Use area 3 for members from node_3 and node_6 to supports to reduce stress. Use area 2 for top chord (node_4-node_5). Remove diagonal member_6 (node_3-node_5) to reduce complexity and redistribute forces. This forms a stable triangular top frame distributing the load better.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_6 vertically above node_3 creates a vertical load path and triangular bracing, reducing bending and stress on node_1-node_4 link. Removing member_7 reduces overstressed member. Increasing member cross-section area on critical members reduces stress. Removing diagonal member_6 simplifies load paths and reduces potential stress concentration.
