Current max stress 79.84 exceeds ±15 and mass 31.16 > 30. Need lighter and less stressed structure.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has high stress in member_7 (79.84) and member_4 (-56.46), mass slightly above limit. Members with area 3 and 1 are used; large areas increase mass. Member_8 has zero stress but large mass (7.036). Nodes 4,5,6 added to reduce stress but mass increased. Need to reduce member areas, remove redundant members, and reposition nodes to better distribute load.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_6 to reduce mass and complexity. Adjust node_4 and node_5 vertically for better force flow. Use smaller area members where possible. Add diagonal members to reduce bending and stress concentration. Keep load/support nodes fixed. Aim for triangular stable truss with minimal members and optimized areas.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_6 and members connected to it. Adjust node_4 to (2.8, 3.2) and node_5 to (3.8, 3.2) for better geometry. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_5, node_4-node_5, node_3-node_4, node_3-node_5. Use areas mostly 2 (0.782) or 1 (0.195) to reduce mass but increase where needed to keep stress ≤15.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing node_6 reduces mass and complexity. Adjusting node_4 and node_5 lowers height slightly to reduce member length and mass. Adding diagonal members node_3-node_5 improves load path and reduces stress on members node_4-node_5 and node_3-node_4. Areas chosen to balance mass and strength: larger areas on members under tension/compression near load, smaller on others. This ensures max stress ≤15 and total mass ≤30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths estimated from node coordinates. Areas assigned from given set.
