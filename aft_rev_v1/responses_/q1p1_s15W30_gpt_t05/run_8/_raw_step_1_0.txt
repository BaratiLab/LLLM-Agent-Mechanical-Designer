Load at node_3, supports fixed. Areas chosen reasonably.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Stress and mass are well within limits. Member_3 has highest stress (7.245), others lower. Structure is stable with pinned and roller supports. Node_3 can be repositioned but is load node, so fixed. Other nodes (node_4) can move but current vertical position is effective for load transfer. Members have varied areas to balance stress and mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing member_3 stress further may require changing node_4 position or member areas. But current max stress is less than half allowable. Mass is below limit. Further optimization gains will be marginal.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Given constraints, current design is efficient. Moving node_4 downward slightly could reduce stress in member_3 but may increase stress elsewhere or mass. Areas are balanced to keep mass low and stress within limits. No violation of constraints. Closed truss maintained. Load and support nodes fixed as per instructions.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress max 7.24 < 15, mass 26.67 < 30. Member areas from set {2,3,4} used.
