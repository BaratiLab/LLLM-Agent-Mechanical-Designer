Load at node_3, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_4 free to move but already positioned well.",\n  "analysis": "All stresses are moderate, no member close to stress or mass limits. The structure is stable and closed. Moving node_4 or changing member areas risks increasing stress or mass. Current areas are balanced with low max stress and reasonable mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Attempting to move node_4 or change areas may not reduce max stress significantly. Stress distribution is already balanced. The load is at node_3, which is fixed in position. Support nodes fixed.",\n  "reasoning": "Given constraints and objectives, further optimization is unlikely to reduce max stress meaningfully without increasing mass or violating constraints. The current design is efficient with good stress distribution and mass utilization.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Max stress = 5.38 < 15, total mass = 23.3452 < 30. Areas selected from given set.
