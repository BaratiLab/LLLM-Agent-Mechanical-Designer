  "preamble": "Current truss meets constraints with low stress and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 5.38 well below Â±15, total mass 23.3452 < 30. Load at node_3, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_4 free to move but already positioned well.",
  "analysis": "All stresses are moderate, no member close to stress or mass limits. The structure is stable and closed. Moving node_4 or changing member areas risks increasing stress or mass. Current areas are balanced with low max stress and reasonable mass.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Attempting to move node_4 or change areas may not reduce max stress significantly. Stress distribution is already balanced. The load is at node_3, which is fixed in position. Support nodes fixed.",
  "reasoning": "Given constraints and objectives, further optimization is unlikely to reduce max stress meaningfully without increasing mass or violating constraints. The current design is efficient with good stress distribution and mass utilization.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Max stress = 5.38 < 15, total mass = 23.3452 < 30. Areas selected from given set. Node_4 at (2.0,3.0) provides good triangulation. Members cover all connections for stability.",
  "calculation": "No changes to node positions or member areas needed. Stress and mass well within limits. Optimization would yield marginal gains only.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Confirm constraints satisfied, no node moves possible for load/support nodes, node_4 position optimal. No duplicate nodes or members. Areas valid. Closed 2D truss maintained.",
