Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Current max stress 9.1 < 15 OK. Mass 40.22 > 30 not OK. Need to reduce mass while maintaining stress limits.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has excessive mass mainly from large area members (area_id 4 and 3). Max stress is low so member areas can be reduced. Node_4 is at (2.5,4.5), causing longer members and higher mass. Node_3 is at (2,0) between supports at (0,0) and (6,0). Load is at node_3 causing bending and tension/compression in members connected to node_3 and node_4. Current design uses 5 members. To reduce mass, reduce areas, optimize node_4 position to shorten members, possibly add an intermediate node to better distribute forces.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce areas from 4 and 3 to 2 or 1. Move node_4 closer to node_3 vertically to reduce length. Possibly add node_5 above node_4 to create a triangular bracing for better force distribution. Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Use minimal members for stability. Recalculate member lengths and assign smaller areas to meet mass < 30 and stress < 15.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep nodes_1,2,3 fixed. Move node_4 to (2.2,3.2) closer to node_3 to reduce member length. Add node_5 at (3.5,3.5) to create a stable triangular truss. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_4-node_3, node_5-node_3. Assign areas mostly 2 or 1 to reduce mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Shorter members reduce mass. Adding node_5 creates additional load path reducing stress concentration. Using smaller areas because max stress in previous iterations was well below limits. Triangular configuration improves stability and load distribution. Areas chosen from available set to balance stress and mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2m, node_3-node_2=4m, node_1-node_4 ~3.8m, node_4-node_5 ~1.5m, node_5-node_2 ~2.7m, node_4-node_3 ~3.2m, node_5-node_3 ~1.8m. Assign area_id=2 (0.782) for longer members, area_id=1 (0.195) for shorter members. Compute approximate mass = sum(length*area). Expected mass < 30. Check stress with reduced areas, expect max stress < 15.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Mass approx = 2*0.782 + 4*0.782 + 3.8*0.782 + 1.5*0.195 + 2.7*0.782 + 3.2*0.782 + 1.8*0.195 = (1.564 + 3.128 + 2.972 + 0.293 + 2.111 + 2.498 + 0.351) = 12.917 mass units << 30.
