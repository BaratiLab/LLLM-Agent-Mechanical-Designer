  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under given loads and supports with stress and mass constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 (-10N, -45deg), supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Max stress ±15, max mass 30. Current max stress 17 (exceeds limit). Mass 14.6 (within limit). Need to reduce stress in members 4 and 7.",
  
  "analysis": "Current structure has 5 nodes and 7 members. Members 4 and 7 exceed stress limits (15.7 and -17). Member 4 is node_4 to node_5 with area 1 (0.195), member 7 is node_5 to node_3 with area 1 (0.195). Increasing area or adjusting geometry needed. Current node_5 placement at (3.5,3.5) causes high stress in members connected to it. Node_4 at (2.2,3.2) is close to node_3 (2.0,0.0), creating steep angles and stress concentration. Propose to remove node_5 and reposition node_4 for better load path. Simplify structure to reduce stress concentrations and use higher area in critical members.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Removing node_5 reduces complexity. Move node_4 slightly upward and right to improve force distribution. Use areas from 2 to 4 for main load members. Use direct triangulation between node_1, node_2, node_3, and node_4. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4. Assign larger areas to members under tension/compression near load.",
  
  "proposal": "Remove node_5. Position node_4 at (2.3, 3.8). Members: member_1: node_1-node_3 area 3, member_2: node_3-node_2 area 3, member_3: node_1-node_4 area 4, member_4: node_4-node_2 area 3, member_5: node_3-node_4 area 3.",
  
  "reasoning": "Removing node_5 reduces stress concentration. Raising node_4 improves load transfer to supports. Using larger areas (3 or 4) on critical members reduces stress. Triangular truss shape with direct load paths is efficient. Areas chosen balance mass and stress constraints. Estimated total mass below 30. Stress expected below ±15 due to increased cross-section and better geometry.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approx: node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_2 = 4.0, node_1-node_4 = sqrt(2.3^2 + 3.8^2) ≈ 4.43, node_4-node_2 = sqrt((6-2.3)^2 + 3.8^2) ≈ 4.94, node_3-node_4 = sqrt((2.3-2)^2 + 3.8^2) ≈ 3.8. Mass = sum(length * area_value) with area values: 3=1.759, 4=3.128. Total mass ≈ 2*1.759 + 4*1.759 + 4.43*3.128 + 4.94*1.759 + 3.8*1.759. Approx mass ~ 25 < 30. Stress reduced by larger areas and better geometry.",
  
  "calculation": "Member masses: m1=2.0*1.759=3.518, m2=4.0*1.759=7.036, m3=4.43*3.128=13.86, m4=4.94*1.759=8.69, m5=3.8*1.759=6.68. Total mass = 3.518+7.036+13.86+8.69+6.68=39.78 (too high). Adjust area for member_3 to 3 (1.759) instead of 4 (3.128). New m3=4.43*1.759=7.79. New total=3.518+7.036+7.79+8.69+6.68=33.7 still high. Reduce member_4 area to 2 (0.782): m4=4.94*0.782=3.86. New total=3.518+7.036+7.79+3.86+6.68=28.9 < 30. Stress still controlled by areas 3,3,3,2,3. Final areas: member_1=3, member_2=3, member_3=3, member_4=2, member_5=3.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Final node positions fixed for supports and load. Removed node_5. Adjusted node_4 position for optimal force flow. Assigned cross-sectional areas to balance stress and mass. Total mass under 30, max stress expected under ±15. No duplicate nodes or members. Structure is statically determinate and triangulated.",
