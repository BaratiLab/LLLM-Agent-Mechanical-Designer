    "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to meet stress ≤ ±15 and mass ≤ 30 under given load/supports.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 36.26 exceeds ±15 limit; mass 15.6 < 30, so mass not limiting. Load at node_3 downward-left. Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Existing nodes mostly fixed, can add/move node_4 and node_5.",

    "analysis": "High compressive stress (-36.26) on member_5 (node_3 to node_5) indicates member too small or geometry causes high load. Members connecting node_5 to node_2 and node_4 have low or zero stress, indicating underutilization. Current structure has vertical members node_4-node_5 and node_3-node_5, causing stress concentration. Need to redistribute load paths and add diagonal bracing to reduce stress and keep mass low.",

    "scratch_pad_2": "Consider removing node_5 or repositioning it to reduce length and stress in members connected to it. Add diagonal members from top nodes to supports to create stable triangular substructures. Use smaller cross sections for less stressed members and larger for high stress but keep total mass < 30.",

    "proposal": "Remove node_5, reposition node_4 slightly higher and shifted horizontally to create effective diagonals. Add diagonal member from node_4 to node_2 and from node_4 to node_3. Use areas to balance stress: larger area (3 or 4) for main tension/compression members, smaller (1 or 2) for diagonals. Maintain load/support nodes fixed.",

    "reasoning": "Triangular bracing reduces bending and distributes forces efficiently. Removing node_5 reduces complexity and eliminates overstressed member_5. Shifting node_4 to (2.5, 4.5) creates better geometry for load transfer. Diagonal members from node_4 to node_2 and node_3 create stable load paths. Areas chosen to keep stresses within ±15 and total mass under 30.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths, assign areas, estimate stresses proportional to force path and length. Check mass = sum(length * area_factor). Ensure max stress ≤ 15. Use area factors: 0:1, 1:0.195, 2:0.782, 3:1.759, 4:3.128.",

    "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_2 = 4.0, node_1-node_4 ≈ 5.147, node_4-node_2 ≈ 3.354, node_4-node_3 ≈ 2.915. Assign areas: member_1 (node_1-node_3): 3 (1.759), member_2 (node_3-node_2): 3 (1.759), member_3 (node_1-node_4): 4 (3.128), member_4 (node_4-node_2): 3 (1.759), member_5 (node_4-node_3): 2 (0.782). Approximate total mass = 2*1.759 + 4.5*3.128 + 3.354*1.759 + 2.915*0.782 ≈ 3.518 + 14.07 + 5.9 + 2.28 = 25.77 < 30. Stress distribution expected to be balanced with these areas.",

    "scratch_pad_final": "All members form stable triangles, no overstressed members expected. Mass below 30. Load path direct to supports. No duplicate nodes or members. Supports and load nodes fixed. Node_4 repositioned for optimal geometry.",
