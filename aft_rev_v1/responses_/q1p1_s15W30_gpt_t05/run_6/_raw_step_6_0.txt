Member 4 is node_4 to node_5 with area 1 (0.195), member 7 is node_5 to node_3 with area 1 (0.195). Increasing area or adjusting geometry needed. Current node_5 placement at (3.5,3.5) causes high stress in members connected to it. Node_4 at (2.2,3.2) is close to node_3 (2.0,0.0), creating steep angles and stress concentration. Propose to remove node_5 and reposition node_4 for better load path. Simplify structure to reduce stress concentrations and use higher area in critical members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Removing node_5 reduces complexity.

Raising node_4 improves load transfer to supports. Using larger areas (3 or 4) on critical members reduces stress. Triangular truss shape with direct load paths is efficient.
