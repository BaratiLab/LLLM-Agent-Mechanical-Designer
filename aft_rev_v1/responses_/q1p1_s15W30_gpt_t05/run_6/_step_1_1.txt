  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to satisfy max stress ±15 and mass ≤30 with given loads and supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 downward-left; supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller); current max stress 36.26 > 15; mass 9.675 < 30; need to reduce stress by changing geometry and member areas.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design has high stress in member_6 (-36.26) and members_4,5 above 15. Members_2 and 3 have zero area (area_id '0' = 1), but stresses still high. Member_1 area is small (0.195), possibly insufficient. Geometry is flat at bottom with node_3 between supports, node_4 elevated. The load at node_3 causes high stress in diagonal members. To reduce stress, add nodes to better distribute forces and increase areas strategically. Avoid large areas that increase mass unnecessarily.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_6 highly stressed in compression; consider adding intermediate node above node_3 to form a more triangular load path. Increase areas in highly stressed members to reduce stress. Possibly remove redundant members or reduce areas in low-stress members to save mass.",
  
  "proposal": "Add a new node above node_3 at (2.0, 5.0) to form a higher triangle, connect node_4 to new node and new node to node_3 and node_2. Adjust areas: increase area_id to 3 (1.759) or 4 (3.128) for highly stressed members (member_6, member_4), keep low area for others. Remove member_5 (node_4 to node_2) to reduce mass and stress concentration. Keep members from supports to new node for better load path.",
  
  "reasoning": "Adding node above node_3 increases truss height, reducing axial forces by increasing member length and improving force distribution. Removing member_5 reduces redundant load path causing high stress. Increasing areas on critical members reduces stress below limit. Keeping total mass under 30 is easy with these changes. Geometry remains stable with pinned and roller supports fixed. No change to load/support nodes ensures constraints met.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths: node_1 to node_3 (2.0), node_3 to node_2 (4.0), node_4 to node_1 (3.5), node_4 to new_node (1.5), new_node to node_3 (2.0), new_node to node_2 (4.0). Areas assigned to keep stress <15. Remove member_5 to reduce stress concentration and mass. Total mass estimated <15, well below 30.",
  
  "calculation": "Member lengths (approx): m1(node_1-node_3)=2.0, m2(node_3-node_2)=4.0, m3(node_4-node_1)=3.5, m4(node_4-new_node)=1.5, m5(new_node-node_3)=2.0, m6(new_node-node_2)=4.0. Areas: m1=3 (1.759), m2=2 (0.782), m3=3 (1.759), m4=3 (1.759), m5=2 (0.782), m6=3 (1.759). Mass = sum(length*area) ≈ (2*1.759)+(4*0.782)+(3.5*1.759)+(1.5*1.759)+(2*0.782)+(4*1.759)=3.518+3.128+6.157+2.638+1.564+7.036=24.04 <30. Stress reduction expected due to better geometry and increased areas.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New node added, member_5 removed, areas increased on critical members, mass under 30, stresses expected under ±15. Geometry stable with fixed supports and load node unchanged. No duplicate nodes or members. Ready for FEM verification.",
