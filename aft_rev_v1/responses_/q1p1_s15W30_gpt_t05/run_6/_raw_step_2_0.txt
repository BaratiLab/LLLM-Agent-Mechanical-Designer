Max stress ±15, max mass 30. Current mass 31.55 > 30, max stress 8.47 < 15. Need to reduce mass while maintaining stress limits.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has 5 nodes including one added node_5. Members have areas mostly 2 or 3. Total mass exceeds limit by ~1.55 units. Max stress is safe. Members connected to node_5 add mass but do not reduce stress significantly. Node_5 at (2.0,5.0) is far and adds long members. Member_6 is very heavy (11.26 mass).",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce mass: remove node_5 and its members, rearrange members to better distribute load. Possibly increase area of critical members to reduce stress and allow smaller areas elsewhere. Keep node_4 for vertical support but optimize its position. Use areas from 0 to 10, select minimal area that meets stress. Keep load and support nodes fixed.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_5. Keep nodes 1,2,3,4. Move node_4 slightly to optimize geometry (e.g., (2.0,4.0)). Connect members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4. Assign areas to balance mass and stress: use area 3 or 2 for main members, smaller for less stressed. This reduces long members and mass below 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing node_5 eliminates heavy members 5 and 6. Node_4 positioned at 4.0m height gives good leverage for vertical support. Members form a stable triangular truss with diagonals. Areas chosen to keep stress under 15 and reduce member mass. Shorter members reduce mass. Load at node_3 is supported by pinned and roller nodes with proper member layout.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2m, node_3-node_2=4m, node_1-node_4=4m, node_4-node_2=4m, node_3-node_4=approx 2.828m. Assign areas: member_1 (node_1-node_3) area 2 (0.782), member_2 (node_3-node_2) area 2, member_3 (node_1-node_4) area 1 (0.195), member_4 (node_4-node_2) area 1, member_5 (node_3-node_4) area 2. Mass sum = sum(length*area) approx (2*0.782 + 4*0.782 + 4*0.195 + 4*0.195 + 2.828*0.782) = 1.564 + 3.128 + 0.78 + 0.78 + 2.212 = 8.464 < 30. Stress expected below limit due to proper load path and reduced member areas.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Mass approx 8.464 < 30. Stress distribution expected balanced.
