Must add members and possibly one node to close truss and reduce stress.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current nodes are colinear along x-axis, no closed polygon formed. To form a closed truss, add one node above the line to form a triangle. Triangular truss is statically determinate and efficient. Use node_4 at (2.0, h) with h>0. Choose h to balance member lengths and stresses. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_2 exist? node_1-node_2 is base, node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2 along x-axis. Add node_4 connected to all three base nodes to close truss. This forms 3 new members: node_4-node_1, node_4-node_2, node_4-node_3. Total members: 6.

Load at node_3 downward-left (-10 at -45°) implies tension/compression in members connected to node_3 and node_4.
