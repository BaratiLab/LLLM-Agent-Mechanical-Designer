Current max stress 5.64 well below limit, mass 29.22 near max. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 movable.",\n  "analysis": "Current structure is a 4-node closed truss with members sized mostly area 3 and one area 2. Max stress is low and mass close to limit. Node_4 moved upward to 3.8 improves stress distribution. No overstressed members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further reducing stress likely requires increasing member areas or repositioning node_4. Increasing areas increases mass beyond limit. Moving node_4 further may reduce stress but mass already near max.",\n  "reasoning": "Given max stress is low (5.64 vs limit 15) and mass close to max (29.22 vs 30), further optimization to reduce stress would increase mass or require major topology change. Current topology is minimal closed truss with 5 members, all essential. Moving node_4 higher may reduce stress but would increase member lengths and mass. Reducing member areas would increase stress. Load and supports fixed, node_3 fixed at (2,0).",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: m1 ~2.3, m2 ~3.7, m3 ~4.4, m4 ~3.7, m5 ~4.1 units. Areas: mostly 3 (1.759). Mass = sum(length*area). Max stress well below limit. No member close to stress limit. Mass close to limit. No redundant members to remove.",\n  "calculation": "Mass calculated from lengths and areas matches given 29.22. Max stress 5.64 is low. Moving node_4 slightly up or down changes lengths and stresses but likely increases mass or stress. Current design is near optimal balance. No smaller area feasible without exceeding stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Design meets all constraints with margin on stress and mass near limit.
