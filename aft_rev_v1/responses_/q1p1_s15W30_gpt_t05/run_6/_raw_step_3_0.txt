Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Current max stress 27 > 15, mass 9.8 < 30. Need to reduce stress by better force path and member sizing.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high tensile stress (27) in member_3 (node_1-node_4) and compressive stress (-12) in member_1. Member areas are small for high stress members. Node_4 at (2,4) supports diagonal members but stress is unbalanced. Load is at node_3 on bottom chord, causing large bending moment. Structure lacks vertical member at node_3 to transfer load directly to supports. Existing members connect node_3 horizontally and diagonally to node_4. No vertical member from node_3 to node_4 to reduce bending.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add vertical member from node_3 to node_4 to reduce bending and redistribute forces. Increase cross-sectional areas on high-stress members. Possibly add node_5 above node_4 to form a truss triangle for better load path. Keep node_1 and node_2 fixed, do not move node_3 or supports. Use areas 3 or 4 for critical members to reduce stress below 15. Keep total mass under 30.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (2.0, 5.0) above node_4 to form upper chord. Connect node_3 to node_5 vertically and diagonally to node_4 and node_5. Use member areas: 4 (3.128) for main load paths (node_1-node_4, node_4-node_5), 3 (1.759) for vertical and diagonal members from node_3. Keep bottom chord members at area 2 (0.782). Remove member_5 (node_3-node_4) to avoid redundancy and reduce mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 creates a triangular truss top chord, improving load distribution. Vertical member from node_3 to node_5 reduces bending moment on bottom chord. Larger cross section on main chords reduces stress. Removing redundant diagonal member reduces mass. Triangular geometry improves stiffness and reduces max stress. Areas chosen balance mass and strength.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_5 at (2.0,5.0).
