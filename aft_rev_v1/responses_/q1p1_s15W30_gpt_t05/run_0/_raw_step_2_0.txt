Current max stress 14.04, mass 25.04, within limits. Nodes at fixed supports and load fixed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design added node_5 and members to form a closed truss, redistributing stresses effectively. Max stress lowered from 34.19 to 14.04, mass increased but still under 30. Stress distribution is balanced, no member near limit except member_1 at -14.04. Load and support nodes fixed, so only internal nodes can move. Further node movement risks minor improvement but may increase mass or complexity.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_5 at (2,2.5) creates triangular substructures reducing stress concentration. Members with larger areas on critical members (area 3) reduce stress. Minor adjustments unlikely to yield significant stress reduction given constraints and current layout.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Design principles favor closed truss with triangular elements for stability and stress distribution. Current layout uses logical triangulation. Member areas chosen to balance mass and stress capacity. Further node movement constrained by fixed support/load nodes and diminishing returns. Stress near limit in member_1 but acceptable. Mass well below max allows some margin but no clear weak points to optimize further.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length and area correlate with mass; current total mass 25.04 < 30. Max stress 14.04 < 15. Load at node_3 fixed at (-10, -45°). Supports fixed. Node_4 and node_5 positioned for optimal triangulation. Members with area 3 on longer members reduce stress. No redundant members or nodes.",\n  \n  "calculation": "No changes to node positions or members needed. Stress and mass within constraints. Closed truss maintained. Member stresses balanced. Total mass 25.0412 < 30, max stress 14.04 < 15. Node positions: node_1 (0.0,0.0), node_2 (6.0,0.0), node_3 (2.0,0.0), node_4 (2.5,1.5), node_5 (2.0,2.5).
