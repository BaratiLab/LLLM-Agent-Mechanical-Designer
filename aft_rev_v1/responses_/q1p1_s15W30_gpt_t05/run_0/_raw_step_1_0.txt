Constraints: max Â±15 stress, max 30 mass. Current design fails stress (member_3=34.188) though mass is well under limit (8.82).",\n\n  "analysis": "Current design has member_3 highly overstressed in tension (34.188 > 15). Members 1 and 5 also exceed tensile or compressive limits. Mass is low, so area can be adjusted or geometry changed. Node_4 placement at (3,3) creates long members with high stress. Node_3 is between supports, loaded, but no vertical support nodes to reduce bending. Structure lacks triangulation around loaded node_3 to better distribute forces.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, add nodes to create a triangular truss that better channels load from node_3 to supports. Possibly add a node above node_3 to form triangles. Increase area on highly stressed members but keep overall mass low. Remove low area members that do not help load path. Keep load/support nodes fixed.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add one new node above node_3 at (2.0, 2.5). Connect node_3 to new node_5, node_5 to node_1 and node_2, forming two triangles (node_1-node_3-node_5 and node_2-node_3-node_5). Remove member_5 (node_4 to node_2) and member_3 (node_1 to node_4). Keep node_4 for stability but reposition to reduce member lengths. Use areas: members carrying high tension/compression with area \'3\' or \'4\' (1.759 or 3.128), others smaller to keep mass low.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Triangular geometry is statically stable and distributes load efficiently. Adding node_5 above node_3 creates two triangles, reducing bending in members. Removing member_3 (overstressed) and member_5 (less effective) reduces stress concentration. Increasing areas on critical members reduces stress. Node_4 repositioned closer to node_3 to shorten members and reduce stress. Areas chosen to keep total mass <30 while meeting stress limits.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths: node_1-node_3=2m, node_3-node_2=4m, node_3-node_5=2.5m, node_5-node_1=~3.2m, node_5-node_2=~4.5m, node_4 repositioned at (2.5,1.5). Assign areas: members connected to node_3 and node_5 area=3 (1.759), others area=1 (0.195). Estimate mass sum(length*area). Verify max stress <15.",\n\n  "calculation": "Member lengths and areas: member_1(node_1-node_3)=2m*0.782=1.564, member_2(node_3-node_2)=4m*0.782=3.128, member_3(node_1-node_4)=~2.5m*0.195=0.4875, member_4(node_4-node_3)=~1.8m*0.782=1.4076, member_5(node_4-node_5)=~1.8m*0.195=0.351, member_6(node_3-node_5)=2.5m*1.759=4.3975, member_7(node_5-node_1)=3.2m*1.759=5.6288, member_8(node_5-node_2)=4.5m*1.759=7.9155; total mass approx 24.88 < 30.
