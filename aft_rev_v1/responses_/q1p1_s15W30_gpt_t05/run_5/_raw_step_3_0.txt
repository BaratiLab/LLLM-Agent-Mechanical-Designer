Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_4 moved closer to node_3 in iteration 2, stress slightly increased. Areas fixed per members.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max tensile stress is on member_5 (node_1-node_4) at 7.7558, close to half max allowable. Member_6 and others have moderate stress. Mass reduced from prior iterations, indicating better material distribution. Node_4 position impacts stress distribution significantly. Current layout is a quadrilateral with diagonal members. Moving node_4 to optimize angle and length can reduce stress concentration in members connected to node_4.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_5 has highest tensile stress; consider moving node_4 to reduce tension there. Node_4 y decreased from 2.5 to 2.1, stress increased; try increasing y slightly to reduce tension. Member lengths and angles affect force distribution and stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "To reduce stress in member_5, increase length or change angle to reduce axial force. Increasing vertical height of node_4 should reduce tension in member_5 by increasing its length and changing angle, distributing load better. Check mass impact due to length changes. Keep node_4 x near previous 1.7 to maintain geometry. Areas are fixed; so geometry is main variable. Load at node_3 fixed at (-10, -45 deg). Supports fixed. Ensure no member exceeds ±15 stress and total mass ≤ 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Try node_4 at (1.7, 2.5) or slightly higher than 2.1 to reduce tensile stress on member_5. Calculate approximate member lengths and expect mass impact. Member_5 length increases, mass may increase slightly but still under 30. Stress expected to drop due to better force distribution. Validate no duplicate nodes or members. Areas remain same.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Current node_4 at (1.7, 2.1) yields member_5 stress 7.7558. Increase y to 2.4. Length member_5 from node_1(0,0) to node_4(1.7,2.4) = sqrt(1.7² + 2.4²) ≈ 2.93 (was ~2.7). Member_6 length changes from node_2(6,0) to node_4(1.7,2.4) ≈ sqrt(4.3² + 2.4²) ≈ 4.9 (was ~4.3).
