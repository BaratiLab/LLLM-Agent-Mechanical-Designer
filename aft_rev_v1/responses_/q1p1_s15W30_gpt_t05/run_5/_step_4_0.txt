  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress and maintain constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 7.39 < 15, total mass 25.65 < 30. Node_4 moved upward from 2.1 to 2.4 improved stress. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Member areas fixed. Goal: minimize max stress further by adjusting node_4 y within bounds.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_5 (7.39 tensile) and member_6 (6.18 tensile). Member_5 connects node_1 (0,0) to node_4 (1.7,2.4). To reduce tensile stress on member_5, node_4 could be shifted horizontally or vertically to better align force paths and balance stresses. Moving node_4 slightly right and down might reduce tension in member_5 and compressive stress in others. Mass is acceptable, so focus on stress reduction.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try moving node_4 from (1.7, 2.4) to (1.9, 2.2). This keeps node_4 inside the triangle formed by fixed nodes and load node. Member lengths and areas remain same. Expect better force distribution and reduced max stress.",
  
  "reasoning": "Increasing node_4 x from 1.7 to 1.9 reduces the angle between members 5 and 6, potentially reducing tensile stress in member_5. Lowering y from 2.4 to 2.2 reduces vertical force component, lowering stress in vertical members. Member areas remain unchanged to keep mass stable. Constraints on max stress and mass will be checked after adjustment.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate new member lengths with node_4 at (1.9, 2.2). Update member masses accordingly. Estimate stresses assuming linear relation with member length and force distribution. Verify max stress < 15 and mass < 30.",
  
  "calculation": "New member lengths: m5 length = sqrt((1.9-0)^2 + (2.2-0)^2) = sqrt(3.61 +4.84)= sqrt(8.45)=2.906, m6 length = sqrt((6-1.9)^2 + (0-2.2)^2)= sqrt(16.81+4.84)= sqrt(21.65)=4.65. Member masses: m5 = 2.906 * area 0.782=2.27 (similar to before), m6=4.65 * 0.782=3.64 (slightly less than before). Total mass ~25.5. Expected max stress decrease ~5-10% due to better geometry. Stress likely reduces from 7.39 to ~6.5 max. Constraints satisfied.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved to (1.9, 2.2) to reduce max stress while keeping mass within limit. Members and areas unchanged. Load/support nodes fixed. No duplicate members. Ready for next iteration or stop if stress reduction insufficient.",
