  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while maintaining constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 7.76 < 15, total mass 24.83 < 30. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Node_4 moved closer to node_3 in iteration 2, stress slightly increased. Areas fixed per members.",
  
  "analysis": "Max tensile stress is on member_5 (node_1-node_4) at 7.7558, close to half max allowable. Member_6 and others have moderate stress. Mass reduced from prior iterations, indicating better material distribution. Node_4 position impacts stress distribution significantly. Current layout is a quadrilateral with diagonal members. Moving node_4 to optimize angle and length can reduce stress concentration in members connected to node_4.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_5 has highest tensile stress; consider moving node_4 to reduce tension there. Node_4 y decreased from 2.5 to 2.1, stress increased; try increasing y slightly to reduce tension. Member lengths and angles affect force distribution and stress.",
  
  "reasoning": "To reduce stress in member_5, increase length or change angle to reduce axial force. Increasing vertical height of node_4 should reduce tension in member_5 by increasing its length and changing angle, distributing load better. Check mass impact due to length changes. Keep node_4 x near previous 1.7 to maintain geometry. Areas are fixed; so geometry is main variable. Load at node_3 fixed at (-10, -45 deg). Supports fixed. Ensure no member exceeds ±15 stress and total mass ≤ 30.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Try node_4 at (1.7, 2.5) or slightly higher than 2.1 to reduce tensile stress on member_5. Calculate approximate member lengths and expect mass impact. Member_5 length increases, mass may increase slightly but still under 30. Stress expected to drop due to better force distribution. Validate no duplicate nodes or members. Areas remain same.",
  
  "calculation": "Current node_4 at (1.7, 2.1) yields member_5 stress 7.7558. Increase y to 2.4. Length member_5 from node_1(0,0) to node_4(1.7,2.4) = sqrt(1.7² + 2.4²) ≈ 2.93 (was ~2.7). Member_6 length changes from node_2(6,0) to node_4(1.7,2.4) ≈ sqrt(4.3² + 2.4²) ≈ 4.9 (was ~4.3). Slight mass increase but within limit. Expect tensile stress on member_5 to reduce due to increased length and improved force angle. Other stresses expected to remain within limits. Total mass estimated ~25.5 < 30.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved to (1.7, 2.4) to reduce max tensile stress. Members and areas unchanged. Mass within limit. Stress expected reduced. Stop condition false to allow further refinement if needed.",
