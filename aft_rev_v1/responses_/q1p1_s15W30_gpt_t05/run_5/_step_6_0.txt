  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress and maintain mass under 30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress is 8.01 < 15, mass 24.54 < 30. Need to minimize stress further by adjusting node_4 within constraints.",
  "analysis": "Current max stress is on member_5 (7.99 tensile), close to node_4. Members connected to node_4 show high stresses. Moving node_4 slightly upward and right may reduce stress concentration. Areas are fixed; only node_4 can move. Load/support nodes fixed.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try incremental moves of node_4 in (x,y) to find position reducing stress on member_5 and member_6, keeping geometry stable and closed.",
  "reasoning": "Node_4 controls triangle shape with nodes 1 and 2. Moving node_4 closer to node_3 (loaded) may reduce member_5 stress but increase others. Moving node_4 upward and slightly right can better distribute forces. Keep node_4 within reasonable vertical range (~2.0 to 2.5) and x between 1.7 to 2.0.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current node_4: (1.75, 2.0). Try (1.85, 2.3). Estimate member lengths and stress distribution. Expect decrease in member_5 stress from 8.01 to ~7.0, member_6 stress stable or reduced. Mass should remain similar (~24.5).",
  "calculation": "Move node_4 to (1.85, 2.3). Keep all members and areas same. Member lengths: m5 ~ sqrt((1.85)^2 + (2.3)^2) ~ 2.93, m6 ~ sqrt((6-1.85)^2 + (0-2.3)^2) ~ 4.48. Mass changes minimal. Expected stress reduction due to geometry change.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no constraint violation: max stress < 15, total mass < 30. Node_4 moved within allowed limits. No duplicate nodes or members. Load/support nodes unchanged.",
