  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress and maintain constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress is 7.245 < 15, total mass 27.25 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 can be moved. Areas fixed. Goal: reduce max stress further.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress member_5 (node_1-node_4) is highest tensile (7.245). This member length and orientation influence stress. Moving node_4 can redistribute forces and reduce stress in member_5 and others. Member areas seem adequate but can be rechecked after node move. Keep closed truss shape. Current node_4 at (2.0, 3.0).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing height of node_4 might reduce tensile stress on member_5. Also, slight horizontal move may improve force distribution. Must keep node_4 above baseline to maintain closed truss.",
  
  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 closer to node_1 horizontally and slightly lower vertically can reduce tension in member_5 and balance stresses in members 4 and 6. Keep node_4 y > 2 to maintain truss height. Check member lengths and estimated mass after move. Areas can remain same since within constraints. Load at node_3 fixed.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Try node_4 at (1.5, 2.5). Member_5 length reduces, so stress should reduce. Members 4 and 6 length change slightly, possibly reducing compressive stresses. Total mass should decrease slightly due to shorter members with same area.",
  
  "calculation": "Original member_5 length approx sqrt((2-0)^2 + (3-0)^2) = sqrt(4+9)=3.605. New length sqrt((1.5-0)^2 + (2.5-0)^2)=sqrt(2.25+6.25)=2.915 shorter by ~0.69. Mass reduces by area*length*material_density factor. Stress expected to reduce proportionally. Other members lengths adjusted similarly but minor effect. Total mass expected ~26.5-27.0. Max stress expected <7.0.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Move node_4 to (1.5, 2.5). Keep all members, same areas. Check no duplicate nodes or members. Constraints met. Stop false to allow further iteration if needed.",
