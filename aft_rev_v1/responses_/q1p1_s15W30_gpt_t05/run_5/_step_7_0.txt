  "preamble": "Current 4-node truss meets constraints with balanced stress and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective is to minimize max stress below ±15 with mass under 30. Current max stress ~7.74 well below limit, total mass ~25.3 under max 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved iteratively to optimize stress.",
  "analysis": "Stress distribution is balanced; max stress member_5 tension ~7.74, compressive stresses moderate. Mass is controlled by area selections and member lengths. Node_4 position affects stress; current position (1.85, 2.3) yields stable stresses and mass. Previous iterations show no significant improvement in stress or mass beyond this point.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further node_4 movement risks increasing stress in members or mass. Members with area 3 (1.759) and 2 (0.782) effectively balance load. Load direction fixed; supports fixed. No new nodes or members allowed.",
  "reasoning": "Given constraints and history, the current design achieves low max stress and acceptable mass. The truss is statically determinate and stable. Increasing height or shifting node_4 further has shown stress fluctuations without improvement. Member areas are minimal but adequate. Stress is well below ±15 limit, so further optimization yields diminishing returns.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas yield mass sum ~25.3. Max stress 7.74 < 15. Load at node_3 (-10, -45 degrees) well transferred. Supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller fixed. No violations in constraints. No duplicate nodes or members.",
  "calculation": "No changes to node_1, node_2, node_3 per instructions. Node_4 at (1.85, 2.3) optimal per iteration 6. Member connections unchanged. Areas assigned as per current iteration. Mass and stress within limits.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met, no further improvement evident from history. Stop optimization.",
