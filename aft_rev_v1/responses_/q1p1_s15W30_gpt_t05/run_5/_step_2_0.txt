  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress while maintaining constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress currently 7.03 < 15, total mass 26.0361 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved from (2.0,3.0) to (1.5,2.5) reduced mass and stress.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress in member_5 (7.03) is critical. Members around node_4 carry significant stress. Moving node_4 closer to node_1 and node_3 may reduce stress concentration. Member areas are reasonable, no change suggested now. Current design is stable but stress can be further minimized by small nodal repositioning of node_4.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_4 slightly down and right to balance forces, reduce stress in member_5 and member_6. Keep node_4 inside convex hull defined by supports and loaded node. Avoid increasing member lengths significantly to keep mass low.",
  
  "reasoning": "Node_1 and node_2 fixed by supports. Node_3 fixed by load. Node_4 free to move. Reducing height of node_4 reduces bending in members 5 and 6, potentially lowering stress. Moving node_4 horizontally towards node_3 can balance tension/compression in members 4,5,6. Areas chosen to balance mass and strength. No area change needed as stresses are within limits.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: m5 ~ distance(node_1-node_4), m6 ~ distance(node_2-node_4). Moving node_4 from (1.5,2.5) to approx (1.7,2.1) reduces vertical span, likely reducing stress. Calculate length changes and estimate mass impact. Stress reduction expected from better force distribution.",
  
  "calculation": "New node_4 at (1.7, 2.1). Lengths: m5 ~ sqrt((1.7-0)^2+(2.1-0)^2)=2.69, m6 ~ sqrt((6-1.7)^2+(0-2.1)^2)=4.5 approx. Slight reduction in m5 length, slight increase in m6 length but balanced by stress distribution. Mass impact minimal, total mass ~25.9 estimated. Stress expected to reduce max stress to ~6.5 based on force path smoothing.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Check constraints: max stress < 15, mass < 30, no node moves for supports/loads, no duplicate members. Areas unchanged. Node_4 moved to optimize stress. Structure remains closed with 6 members. Ready for next iteration or FEM validation.",
