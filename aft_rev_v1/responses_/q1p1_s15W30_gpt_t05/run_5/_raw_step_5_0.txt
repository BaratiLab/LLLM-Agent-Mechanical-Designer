Load at node_3 fixed; supports fixed. Node_4 moved in previous iterations to trade-off mass and stress. Areas fixed from previous iteration.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_5 (node_1-node_4) has highest tensile stress ~7.97 close to limit. Member_2 (node_1-node_3) has high compressive stress ~-5.17. Node_4 moved between (1.7,2.1) to (1.9,2.2) with stress fluctuations. Slightly lowering node_4 y or shifting x might balance stress better. Mass is well below limit, so minor geometry adjustments are feasible.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing height of node_4 slightly might reduce tensile stress on member_5. Shifting node_4 closer to node_3 might reduce member_5 length and stress. Keep node_4 x > 1.5 to avoid too flat geometry which increased stress before.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Stress in members depends on geometry and load path. Member_5 tensile stress is critical; reducing its length or changing angle can reduce stress. Member_4 and member_6 also connected to node_4 and affect internal force distribution. Small downward and slight left shift of node_4 from (1.9,2.2) can optimize force distribution and reduce member_5 stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Try node_4 ~ (1.75, 2.0). Member lengths: node_1-node_4 shorter, node_2-node_4 slightly longer but area 2 is moderate. Expect member_5 stress to reduce below 7.5. Check total mass remains <30. Areas remain same to isolate geometry effect.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Set node_4 = (1.75, 2.0). Member lengths approx: m5 ~ sqrt((1.75)^2 + (2.0)^2) = 2.66, shorter than previous ~2.9. Mass contribution reduces. Member_5 stress expected to reduce proportionally. Member_4 and 6 may slightly increase in length but within area capacity. Total mass estimated ~24.8 to 25.0. Max stress estimated ~7.5, improved from 7.97.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "New node_4 position (1.75, 2.0) likely reduces max stress and maintains mass constraints. No new members or nodes added.
