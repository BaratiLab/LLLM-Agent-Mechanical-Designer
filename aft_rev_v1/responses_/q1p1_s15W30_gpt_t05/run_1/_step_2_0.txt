  "preamble": "Current 2D truss with added node_5 meets constraints with low max stress and acceptable mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 5.84 << 15 limit, total mass 26.42 < 30 max mass. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_5 added at (2,5) extends truss vertically, distributing load well.",
  
  "analysis": "Stress is well below limit, indicating good load distribution. Mass is close to limit but still under. Members with smaller cross-section areas (1,2,3) used appropriately. Node_5 position above node_4 provides better load path and reduces stress in members connected to node_3 and node_4. No violations in constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Current design already optimized for stress with added node and members. Further repositioning of intermediate nodes (node_3, node_4, node_5) may marginally improve stress but risk increasing mass or losing closure. Load and support nodes fixed, limiting major topology changes.",
  
  "reasoning": "Minimizing stress further would require either adding more nodes or changing member areas drastically, which risks increasing mass. Current member areas and lengths balance stress well. Node positions of load/support fixed, intermediate nodes are well placed vertically and horizontally to distribute load. The structure is closed and stable.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member stresses range from -5.67 to 5.84, far below Â±15 limit. Total mass 26.42 < 30 max mass. Member areas chosen from given set, no violations. Load at node_3 (-10, -45 deg) well supported by members connected to node_3 and node_4. No member overstressed.",
  
  "calculation": "No need to adjust node positions or member areas. Current mass and stress within limits. Member lengths and areas consistent with minimal stress. Further node movement could increase stress or mass. Current design optimal within given constraints and instructions.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verified no duplicate nodes or members. Load/support nodes fixed. Member areas valid. Closed truss. Constraints satisfied. Optimization should stop.",
