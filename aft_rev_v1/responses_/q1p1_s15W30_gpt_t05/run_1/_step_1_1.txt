  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under -10N@node_3 at 45° with pinned and roller supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 downward-left, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Constraints: stress ≤ ±15, mass ≤ 30. Current max stress 38.28 too high, mass 11.4 ok. Need to reduce stress mainly in member_2 (-38.28).",

  "analysis": "Current structure has a horizontal base (node_1 to node_2), load at node_3 between supports, node_4 above node_3 forming a triangle. High stress in member_2 (node_1-node_3) suggests it is overloaded in tension/compression. Members with area_id=1 or 2 may be undersized or geometry not optimal. Increasing area indiscriminately increases mass. Geometry can be improved by adding a node higher above node_3 to better distribute load.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Add one node above node_4 to create two triangles sharing the load. Use larger cross-section for highly stressed members. Remove direct member_1 (node_1-node_2) to reduce compression in long member. Use triangulation with vertical and diagonal members to reduce bending and stress.",

  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (2.0, 5.0) above node_4 to form a 'roof'. Remove member_1 (node_1-node_2). Connect node_5 to node_1, node_2, and node_4. Adjust member areas to reduce stress below ±15. Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed as required. New members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_4, node_4-node_1, node_4-node_2, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_1, node_5-node_2.",

  "reasoning": "Removing long base member reduces compression in that member, shifting load path through node_4 and new node_5. The vertical extension at node_5 creates a stable truss with shorter members and better load distribution. Larger cross-section areas on members connected to node_3 and node_5 reduce stress. Areas selected from given set balancing mass and strength.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_2=4.0, node_3-node_4=3.0, node_4-node_1=3.605551, node_4-node_2=4.472136, node_4-node_5=2.0, node_5-node_1=5.385165, node_5-node_2=4.472136. Assign areas: node_1-node_3: '4' (3.128), node_3-node_2: '4', node_3-node_4: '3' (1.759), node_4-node_1: '3', node_4-node_2: '3', node_4-node_5: '2' (0.782), node_5-node_1: '1' (0.195), node_5-node_2: '1'. Total mass estimate < 30. Stress estimated to be under ±15 due to shorter members and larger areas on high load paths.",

  "calculation": "Mass approx: sum(length × area): (2*3.128)+(4*3.128)+(3*1.759)+(3.605551*1.759)+(4.472136*1.759)+(2*0.782)+(5.385165*0.195)+(4.472136*0.195)=6.256+12.512+5.277+6.343+7.863+1.564+1.050+0.872=41.737 (too high). Reduce some areas: node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2 to '3' (1.759). New mass: (2*1.759)+(4*1.759)+... recalc total mass ~ (3.518+7.036+5.277+6.343+7.863+1.564+1.050+0.872)=33.523 still high. Reduce node_4-node_1 and node_4-node_2 to '2' (0.782): new mass ~ (3.518+7.036+5.277+2.822+3.498+1.564+1.05+0.872)=25.637 under 30. Stress expected under ±15 with these areas and geometry.",
