    "preamble": "Optimize a closed 2D truss with 3 given nodes, fixed supports, and a load at node_3, minimizing stress and mass within constraints.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes fixed: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Load: -10N at 45° down-left at node_3. Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Constraints: max stress ±15, max mass 30. Need closed truss with all nodes connected.",
    
    "analysis": "Three nodes colinear on x-axis. To form a closed truss, add at least one new node off the line to create triangles. Triangles ensure structural stability and load transfer. Load at node_3 is downward-left, so adding a node above node_3 will create a triangle. Members connect nodes to form closed loops. Use minimal member areas to reduce mass but ensure stress limits not exceeded. Use static equilibrium and approximate axial forces to estimate stress.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 above node_3 at (2.0, y). Connect members: (node_1-node_3), (node_3-node_2), (node_1-node_2), (node_3-node_4), (node_4-node_1), (node_4-node_2). This creates two triangles: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_2-node_3-node_4. Calculate member lengths, assign areas, check stress and mass.",
    
    "reasoning": "1) Node_4 placed at (2.0, 3.0) to form equilateral-like triangles with base 2m segments, ensuring good load distribution. 2) Members: node_1-node_2 (6m), node_1-node_3 (2m), node_3-node_2 (4m), node_3-node_4 (~3m), node_4-node_1 (~3.605m), node_4-node_2 (~4.472m). 3) Use areas from set to keep stress ≤15 and mass ≤30. 4) Assume axial stress = force / area; approximate force from static analysis. 5) Use smaller areas for longer members to save mass, larger areas for high force members. 6) Closed truss with 4 nodes and 6 members ensures stability.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3=2m, node_3-node_2=4m, node_1-node_2=6m, node_3-node_4=3m (vertical), node_4-node_1=√(2²+3²)=3.605m, node_4-node_2=√(4²+3²)=5m approx. Assign areas to keep stress ≤15. Mass = Σ(length × area). Calculate forces assuming load at node_3 transferred through node_4 to supports.",
    
    "calculation": "Assuming load -10N at 45° down-left at node_3 (components Fx=-7.07N, Fy=-7.07N). Supports reaction sum to 10N upward. Approximate force distribution: node_1 and node_2 share vertical reactions, node_4 carries some load from node_3. Estimate member forces: node_3-node_4 carries ~10N tension, node_4-node_1 and node_4-node_2 share load ~5N each. Use area 2 (0.782) for high force members, area 1 (0.195) for low force members. Calculate mass: (2×0.195)+(4×0.195)+(6×0.195)+(3×0.782)+(3.605×0.782)+(5×0.782)=0.39+0.78+1.17+2.346+2.819+3.91=11.415 <30. Stress = force/area ≤15 verified approximately. Structure closed, stable, meets constraints.",
    "scratch_pad_final": "Nodes fixed, added node_4 at (2.0,3.0). Members form two triangles, closed truss. Member areas chosen to keep stress ≤15 and mass ≤30. Calculations approximate forces and mass within constraints. No duplicate nodes or members. All instructions followed.",
