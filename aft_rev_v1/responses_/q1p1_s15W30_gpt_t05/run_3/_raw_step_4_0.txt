Nodes fixed at supports and load. Members sized and connected for closed truss.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Stress distribution is balanced with no member exceeding ±15. Mass is below limit. Load node and supports fixed, node_4 moved upward improved stress. Further movement risks increasing stress or mass beyond limits. Current member areas and layout provide good load path and structural stability.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Attempting to move node_4 or node_3 further risks increasing stress or mass. Reducing member areas may violate stress constraints. Adding members increases mass. Current design is a minimal closed truss with efficient force flow.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "The truss is statically determinate with 4 nodes and 5 members forming a stable closed shape. The load at node_3 is well supported by members with appropriate cross sections. Member stresses are well below limits indicating a good balance. Mass is reasonable given member lengths and areas. No duplicate nodes or members exist. Movement of load/support nodes prohibited. Area selections are consistent with stress requirements.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Max stress 9.04 < 15; mass 24.13 < 30.
