  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under given load/supports within stress and mass limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 (-10N, -45°), supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Constraints: max stress ±15, max mass 30. Current design overshoots stress on member_2 (-19.34) and mass is acceptable (~15).",
  
  "analysis": "Member_2 is overstressed in compression (-19.34), area too small (area_id=1). Increasing area there helps but adds mass. Member_1 area increased caused mass rise and stress redistribution unfavorable. Node_4 lowered from 3.0 to 2.5m decreased mass but increased stress on member_2. Current topology is a simple trapezoid with a diagonal. To reduce max compressive stress on member_2, better load path or additional bracing is needed. Adding a node between node_2 and node_4 to split long member_4 and redistribute forces, and adjusting member areas can reduce stress concentration.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Try adding node_5 near node_2 but elevated, create two diagonals from node_3 and node_5 to node_4 and node_2. Increase area of critical members only. Keep member_2 area moderate to reduce stress. Use areas from 0.782 to 3.128 mostly, avoid large areas to keep mass low.",
  
  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (4.0, 1.5). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4. Assign areas: member_2 (node_3-node_5) area_id=3, member_3 (node_5-node_2) area_id=2, others moderate. This topology improves force distribution and reduces max stress on member_2.",
  
  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 splits load path from node_3 to node_2 via node_5, reducing member_2 length and stress. The added diagonal members increase stiffness and reduce bending. Area selection balances stress and mass. Node_4 kept at 2.5m height to maintain vertical support. Members connecting to node_4 and node_5 provide triangulation and stiffness.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: m1: node_1-node_3 = 2m, m2: node_3-node_5 ~2.236m, m3: node_5-node_2 ~1.802m, m4: node_1-node_4 = 2.5m, m5: node_4-node_5 ~2.236m, m6: node_4-node_2 ~4.472m, m7: node_3-node_4 ~2.5m. Area assignments: m1=2, m2=3, m3=2, m4=2, m5=2, m6=1, m7=3. Estimated mass sum approx <30. Max stress expected <15 due to improved load path.",
  
  "calculation": "Mass = sum(length * area_factor). Using area factors: 2=0.782, 3=1.759, 1=0.195. Mass: m1=2*0.782=1.564, m2=2.236*1.759=3.933, m3=1.802*0.782=1.409, m4=2.5*0.782=1.955, m5=2.236*0.782=1.75, m6=4.472*0.195=0.872, m7=2.5*1.759=4.398. Total ~15.88 < 30. Stress expected balanced by triangulation and moderate areas.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "No nodes moved for load/support. Added node_5 for better force distribution. Member areas adjusted to reduce max compressive stress below ±15. Mass well below limit. No duplicate nodes or members.",
