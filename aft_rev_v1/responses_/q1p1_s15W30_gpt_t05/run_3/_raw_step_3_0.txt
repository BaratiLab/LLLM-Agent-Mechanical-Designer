Current max stress 114 exceeds limit, mass 17.5 acceptable. Load at node_3 downward-left. Supports at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has excessive compressive stress in member_6 (-114) and tensile stress in member_5 (32). Members with high stress are connecting node_4 to node_2 and node_4 to node_5. Adding node_5 increased complexity and stress concentration. Need to reduce stress by redistributing forces and possibly removing or repositioning node_5. Areas used are moderate; consider adjusting member areas and geometry to reduce stress while controlling mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_6 with area 1 (0.195) is overloaded; increasing area may increase mass too much. Reconsider node_5 position or remove it. Possibly reposition node_4 higher for better force path. Simplify truss to 4 nodes to reduce stress concentrations. Use larger areas for highly stressed members and smaller for less stressed.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_5 to simplify structure. Move node_4 slightly higher to (2.0, 3.0). Use members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4. Assign areas: members in compression/tension with high stress get area \'3\' (1.759), others \'2\' (0.782). This should balance stresses and keep mass under 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing node_5 reduces complexity and stress concentration. Raising node_4 increases vertical stiffness, reducing bending and stress in bottom chord. Member areas chosen to keep stresses within ±15 while controlling mass. Member lengths calculated for mass estimate. Structure remains statically determinate and stable with pinned and roller supports.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_2 = 4.0, node_1-node_4 = 3.605551275, node_4-node_2 = 4.472135955, node_3-node_4 = sqrt((2-2)^2+(3-0)^2)=3.0. Mass estimate: sum(length*area). Use area \'3\' =1.759 for high stress members, \'2\'=0.782 for others. Check total mass <30 and estimate max stresses <15.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Mass = (2.0*1.759)+(4.0*0.782)+(3.605551275*1.759)+(4.472135955*1.759)+(3.0*0.782) = 3.518 + 3.128 + 6.344 + 7.864 + 2.346 = 23.2 approx < 30.
