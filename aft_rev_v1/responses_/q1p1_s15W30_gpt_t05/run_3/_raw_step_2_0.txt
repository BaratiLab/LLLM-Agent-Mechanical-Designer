Constraints: max stress ±15, max mass 30. Current design overshoots stress on member_2 (-19.34) and mass is acceptable (~15).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_2 is overstressed in compression (-19.34), area too small (area_id=1). Increasing area there helps but adds mass. Member_1 area increased caused mass rise and stress redistribution unfavorable. Node_4 lowered from 3.0 to 2.5m decreased mass but increased stress on member_2. Current topology is a simple trapezoid with a diagonal. To reduce max compressive stress on member_2, better load path or additional bracing is needed. Adding a node between node_2 and node_4 to split long member_4 and redistribute forces, and adjusting member areas can reduce stress concentration.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try adding node_5 near node_2 but elevated, create two diagonals from node_3 and node_5 to node_4 and node_2. Increase area of critical members only. Keep member_2 area moderate to reduce stress. Use areas from 0.782 to 3.128 mostly, avoid large areas to keep mass low.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (4.0, 1.5). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4. Assign areas: member_2 (node_3-node_5) area_id=3, member_3 (node_5-node_2) area_id=2, others moderate. This topology improves force distribution and reduces max stress on member_2.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 splits load path from node_3 to node_2 via node_5, reducing member_2 length and stress. The added diagonal members increase stiffness and reduce bending. Area selection balances stress and mass. Node_4 kept at 2.5m height to maintain vertical support. Members connecting to node_4 and node_5 provide triangulation and stiffness.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: m1: node_1-node_3 = 2m, m2: node_3-node_5 ~2.236m, m3: node_5-node_2 ~1.802m, m4: node_1-node_4 = 2.5m, m5: node_4-node_5 ~2.236m, m6: node_4-node_2 ~4.472m, m7: node_3-node_4 ~2.5m.
