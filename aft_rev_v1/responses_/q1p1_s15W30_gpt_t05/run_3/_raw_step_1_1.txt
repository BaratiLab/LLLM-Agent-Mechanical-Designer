Load at node_3 downward-left. Node_1 and node_2 fixed supports. Node_4 can move vertically to optimize stress distribution.",\n  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_1 (-13.06), tensile/compressive close to limit. Members_3 and 5 also carry significant stress. Member areas are uniform (area_id=2). Adjusting node_4 vertical position may reduce stress in top members and redistribute forces. Increasing area selectively on high stress members can reduce stress. Member lengths and geometry affect stress and mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider lowering node_4 slightly to reduce tension in member_3 and compression in member_1. Keep node_3 position fixed due to load. Adjust member areas: reduce area on low stress members to save mass; increase on high stress members to reduce stress.",\n  "reasoning": "Lowering node_4 reduces vertical component in members_3 and 5, reducing their stress. Member_1 compression can be reduced by changing geometry and area. Member_2 has low stress, area can be reduced to save mass. Member_4 moderate stress, area can be slightly reduced or maintained. Member_5 compression is high, increase area to reduce stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Current areas all 2 (0.782). Increase member_1 and member_5 to area 3 (1.759) to reduce stress.

Member_1 and member_5 area increased to 3. Member_2 area reduced to 1. Member_3 and member_4 remain area 2.
