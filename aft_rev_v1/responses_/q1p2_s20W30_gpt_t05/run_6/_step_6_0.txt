  "stop": "True",
  "preamble": "Current structure meets constraints with low stress and acceptable mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 6.7 < 20, total mass 26.55 < 30; load at node_3, supports fixed; node_1 and node_2 fixed; nodes 4 and 5 movable.",
  
  "analysis": "Structure is stable, max stress well below limit, mass under max. Member areas mostly 2 or 3, indicating moderate cross-sections. Stress distribution is balanced with no member near limits. Minor stress reduction possible by small node moves but unlikely to improve significantly.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Members with higher stress are member_1 (-6.7), member_4 (5.24), member_7 (-5.69). Node_4 and node_5 positions are reasonable. Member_6 and member_7 connect node_3 to nodes 4 and 5, distributing forces well.",
  
  "reasoning": "Further node movement risks increasing stress or mass. The current closed truss with 5 nodes and 7 members is efficient. Member areas correspond well to stress demands. Load applied at node_3 is well supported by pinned and roller supports at nodes 1 and 2. No violation of constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress limits Â±20, max mass 30; current max stress 6.7, mass 26.55. Node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_3 fixed due to load. Nodes 4 and 5 positioned to balance forces, minimal eccentricity. Member areas chosen to balance mass and strength.",
  
  "calculation": "Mass sum(member length * area factor) = 26.55 < 30. Max stress 6.7 < 20. No members overstressed. No need to increase area or add members. Node moves minimal benefit. Structure optimal within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints satisfied. Stress minimized reasonably. No further optimization expected to yield significant improvement without constraint violation.",
