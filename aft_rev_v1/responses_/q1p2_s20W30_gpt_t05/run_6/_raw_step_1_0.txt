Members connecting load node_3 to node_4 and node_2 have high stresses. The structure is asymmetric with node_4 only above node_3. The load direction is diagonal downward left, causing tension in upper members and compression in lower members. Current member areas are moderate but insufficient. Node_3 is between supports, which is good. Adding a node above node_3 to distribute load and adding diagonal members to reduce stress concentration is beneficial. Increase cross-sectional areas of highly stressed members if needed. Keep support nodes fixed.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_5 above node_4 to form a truss triangle with node_3 and node_4 to better distribute load. Add member from node_5 to node_2 and node_5 to node_4. Adjust member areas to reduce stress on member_3 and member_5. Possibly increase area of members in tension. Remove member_5 and replace with two smaller members to reduce stress. Check member lengths and areas to keep mass < 30.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Add node_5 at (3.5, 5.0) above node_4.

Removing member_5 and replacing with members involving node_5 redistributes forces. Increasing cross-sectional areas of tension members reduces stress.
