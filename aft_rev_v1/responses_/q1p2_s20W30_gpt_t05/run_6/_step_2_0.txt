  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to meet stress ±20 and mass ≤30 constraints under given load and supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load applied at node_3 (-10 N at -45°). Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Current max stress 26.86 > 20, mass 29.76 close to limit. Need to reduce max stress and mass by adjusting topology, areas, and possibly adding nodes.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design has member_5 overstressed (26.86). Member_5 is short and light area (1), but stress too high. Mass is near limit, so increasing areas broadly is limited. The load at node_3 causes high stress in member_5 (node_4-node_5). Current node_5 at (3.5,5.0) is high and far from load nodes. The design has redundant members (member_7) which adds mass but no stress relief. The structure lacks sufficient triangulation near load to distribute forces effectively.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing length of highly stressed members and redistributing load paths can reduce stress. Possibly move node_5 closer to node_4 and node_3 vertically to shorten members and add bracing. Remove or replace member_7 to reduce mass. Use smaller areas on low-stress members and increase areas only on critical members. Maintain supports and load nodes fixed.",
  
  "proposal": "Remove node_5 at (3.5,5.0). Add a new node_5 at (2.8,4.0) to improve triangulation and shorten members. Connect node_5 to node_4 and node_2. Remove member_7 (node_3-node_5) to reduce mass. Use areas: member_5 (node_4-node_5) area '2' (0.782), member_6 (node_5-node_2) area '3' (1.759). Reduce areas on members with low stress to '1' or '0'. Add member between node_3 and node_5 for triangulation only if stress allows.",
  
  "reasoning": "Moving node_5 closer reduces member lengths and stress in members connected to it. Removing member_7 reduces mass and complexity. Adjusting areas to meet stress constraints without exceeding mass limit is key. Triangulation ensures stability and load distribution. Smaller areas on low-stress members reduce mass. Maintaining load and support nodes fixed preserves boundary conditions.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and estimate stresses proportional to load and member geometry. Use area selection to keep stress ≤20 and total mass ≤30. Check member stresses for compression or tension and adjust areas accordingly. Verify no duplicate members or nodes.",
  
  "calculation": "Member lengths (approx):\nnode_1-node_3: 2.0m\nnode_3-node_2: 4.0m\nnode_1-node_4: 3.0m\nnode_3-node_4: ~3.16m\nnode_4-node_5: ~1.41m\nnode_5-node_2: ~3.6m\nMass approx = sum(length * area_factor). Assign areas to keep total mass ≤30.\nReduce member_5 area from '1' (0.195) to '2' (0.782) to balance stress and mass.\nRemove member_7 to reduce mass by ~9.18.\nEstimate max stress <20 with these changes.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Final node positions and connectivity ensure load paths, support constraints, and triangulation. Areas selected minimize mass and maintain stress limits. Removed redundant members to reduce mass. Positions precise to two decimals for optimization clarity.",
