    "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under given load and support with stress and mass constraints.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 (-10N at -45Â°), supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Current max stress 29.05 > 20 limit. Mass 8.7161 < 30 limit. Need to reduce max stress below 20 while keeping mass reasonable.",
    
    "analysis": "Current design has member_3 overstressed in tension (29.05 > 20) and member_5 overstressed in tension (20.15 > 20). Members connecting load node_3 to node_4 and node_2 have high stresses. The structure is asymmetric with node_4 only above node_3. The load direction is diagonal downward left, causing tension in upper members and compression in lower members. Current member areas are moderate but insufficient. Node_3 is between supports, which is good. Adding a node above node_3 to distribute load and adding diagonal members to reduce stress concentration is beneficial. Increase cross-sectional areas of highly stressed members if needed. Keep support nodes fixed.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_5 above node_4 to form a truss triangle with node_3 and node_4 to better distribute load. Add member from node_5 to node_2 and node_5 to node_4. Adjust member areas to reduce stress on member_3 and member_5. Possibly increase area of members in tension. Remove member_5 and replace with two smaller members to reduce stress. Check member lengths and areas to keep mass < 30.",
    
    "proposal": "Add node_5 at (3.5, 5.0) above node_4. Add members: node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_3-node_5. Remove member_5 (node_2-node_4). Increase areas of members under high tension to area_id '4' (3.128) or '5' (4.887). Use lower areas for compression members. Keep existing nodes 1,2,3,4 fixed.",
    
    "reasoning": "Adding node_5 creates a more triangular load path distributing forces and reducing stress concentration on member_3 and member_5. Removing member_5 and replacing with members involving node_5 redistributes forces. Increasing cross-sectional areas of tension members reduces stress. Using node_5 at (3.5,5.0) balances the height and horizontal span. Member lengths remain reasonable to limit mass. Areas selected from given discrete set to optimize mass and stress. Supports unchanged to maintain boundary conditions.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_1-node_3 ~2m, node_3-node_2 ~4m, node_1-node_4 ~3.605m, node_3-node_4 ~3m, node_4-node_5 ~2.061m, node_5-node_2 ~3.201m, node_3-node_5 ~5.315m. Assign areas: member_1 (node_1-node_3): 3 (1.759), member_2 (node_3-node_2): 3 (1.759), member_3 (node_1-node_4): 2 (0.782), member_4 (node_3-node_4): 2 (0.782), member_5 (node_4-node_5): 1 (0.195), member_6 (node_5-node_2): 2 (0.782), member_7 (node_3-node_5): 4 (3.128). Total mass approx sum(length*area). Check stresses expected to be under 20 by load distribution.",
    
    "calculation": "Mass calculation: member_1:2*1.759=3.518, member_2:4*1.759=7.036, member_3:3.605*0.782=2.819, member_4:3*0.782=2.346, member_5:2.061*0.195=0.402, member_6:3.201*0.782=2.503, member_7:5.315*3.128=16.62. Total mass=3.518+7.036+2.819+2.346+0.402+2.503+16.62=35.244 > 30. Reduce area of member_7 to 3 (1.759): 5.315*1.759=9.35, new total mass=28.0 approx. All other areas same. This keeps mass under 30.",
    "scratch_pad_final": "Final mass ~28 < 30. Max stress expected <20 due to better load path and increased areas. Members in tension have larger areas. Added node_5 improves structural redundancy and load distribution. Supports unchanged. Load node unchanged. No duplicate nodes or members. Areas chosen from allowed set.",
