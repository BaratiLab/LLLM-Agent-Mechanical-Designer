Member areas mostly 2 or 3, indicating moderate cross-sections. Stress distribution is balanced with no member near limits. Minor stress reduction possible by small node moves but unlikely to improve significantly.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Members with higher stress are member_1 (-6.7), member_4 (5.24), member_7 (-5.69). Node_4 and node_5 positions are reasonable. Member_6 and member_7 connect node_3 to nodes 4 and 5, distributing forces well.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Further node movement risks increasing stress or mass. The current closed truss with 5 nodes and 7 members is efficient. Member areas correspond well to stress demands.
