Current max stress exceeds ±20 limit, mass under 30 but stress critical. Need stiffer members or better load path.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High compressive stresses on members connected to node_4 and node_5 cause failure. Member_7 from node_1 to node_5 with area 1 causes extreme stress (680). Current topology with node_5 near top right causes stress concentration. The load applied at node_3 on bottom chord leads to high stresses in diagonal and top members. Existing nodes for supports and load fixed; node_5 can be repositioned or removed. Current design uses too many small-area members causing overstress. Need to simplify truss geometry and increase member areas strategically.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_5 to reduce complexity and stress concentration. Use a classic triangular truss with nodes at supports and one or two top nodes to distribute load. Use larger areas on main load path members, smaller areas on secondary. Keep members in tension/compression within ±20. Check member lengths and update areas accordingly.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Use nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0) (load), node_4(3,3), node_5(4.5,3).

Assign areas to keep stresses ≤20: main chords area 4 (3.128), diagonals area 3 (1.759).",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular truss with two top nodes distributes load from node_3 to supports efficiently. Bottom chord carries tension/compression, top chord carries opposite. Diagonals reduce bending and distribute forces. Larger areas on chords reduce stress; smaller on diagonals save mass. Node_5 moved left and higher to reduce long compression members. Removing member_7 which caused large stress. This layout balances load paths and reduces max stress below 20.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3=2m, node_3-node_2=4m, node_1-node_4=~3.605m, node_4-node_5=1.5m, node_5-node_2=~3.354m, node_3-node_4=~3.162m, node_3-node_5=~3.605m, node_4-node_2=~3.605m.
