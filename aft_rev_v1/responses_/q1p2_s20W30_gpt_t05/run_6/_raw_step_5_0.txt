Max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current design stress exceeds -25 on member_6 and -15 on member_7, mass near limit.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high compressive stress on diagonal members (member_6, member_7) with smallest area (area_id=1). Increasing area here will reduce stress but increase mass. Overall mass is close to limit. Members near load nodes are critical. Current topology has 5 nodes with 8 members. Members connecting node_3 to nodes_4 and 5 are overstressed. Areas on these members are minimal. Increasing area or changing geometry to reduce stress is needed. Node placement can be adjusted to reduce member lengths and redistribute forces. Adding a node between node_3 and node_5 or adjusting node_5 position may help reduce stress in member_7. Using a triangular bracing to improve force path and reduce bending stresses is beneficial.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing stress on member_6 and member_7 by increasing their area and adjusting node_5 position closer to node_3 to reduce member length. Possibly remove member_8 (node_4 to node_2) since its stress is low and it adds mass. Consider increasing area of member_6 and member_7 to area_id=2 or 3. Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Move node_4 slightly to optimize force path. Add a new node between node_3 and node_5 or adjust node_5 coordinates for better load distribution.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Modify current design: keep nodes 1,2,3 fixed. Move node_4 to (2.8, 2.8), node_5 to (3.8, 3.2). Increase area of member_6 and member_7 to \'2\'. Remove member_8 to save mass. Members: member_1: node_1-node_3 area 3; member_2: node_3-node_2 area 3; member_3: node_1-node_4 area 3; member_4: node_4-node_5 area 2; member_5: node_5-node_2 area 2; member_6: node_3-node_4 area 2; member_7: node_3-node_5 area 2.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing area on highly stressed members reduces stress. Moving node_5 closer to node_3 shortens member_7, reducing stress and mass. Moving node_4 slightly improves force distribution. Removing low-stress member_8 reduces mass.
