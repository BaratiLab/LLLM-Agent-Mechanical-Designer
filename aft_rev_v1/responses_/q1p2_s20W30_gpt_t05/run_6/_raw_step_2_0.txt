Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Current max stress 26.86 > 20, mass 29.76 close to limit. Need to reduce max stress and mass by adjusting topology, areas, and possibly adding nodes.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has member_5 overstressed (26.86). Member_5 is short and light area (1), but stress too high. Mass is near limit, so increasing areas broadly is limited. The load at node_3 causes high stress in member_5 (node_4-node_5). Current node_5 at (3.5,5.0) is high and far from load nodes. The design has redundant members (member_7) which adds mass but no stress relief. The structure lacks sufficient triangulation near load to distribute forces effectively.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing length of highly stressed members and redistributing load paths can reduce stress. Possibly move node_5 closer to node_4 and node_3 vertically to shorten members and add bracing. Remove or replace member_7 to reduce mass. Use smaller areas on low-stress members and increase areas only on critical members. Maintain supports and load nodes fixed.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_5 at (3.5,5.0). Add a new node_5 at (2.8,4.0) to improve triangulation and shorten members. Connect node_5 to node_4 and node_2. Remove member_7 (node_3-node_5) to reduce mass. Use areas: member_5 (node_4-node_5) area \'2\' (0.782), member_6 (node_5-node_2) area \'3\' (1.759). Reduce areas on members with low stress to \'1\' or \'0\'. Add member between node_3 and node_5 for triangulation only if stress allows.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Moving node_5 closer reduces member lengths and stress in members connected to it. Removing member_7 reduces mass and complexity. Adjusting areas to meet stress constraints without exceeding mass limit is key. Triangulation ensures stability and load distribution. Smaller areas on low-stress members reduce mass. Maintaining load and support nodes fixed preserves boundary conditions.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and estimate stresses proportional to load and member geometry.
