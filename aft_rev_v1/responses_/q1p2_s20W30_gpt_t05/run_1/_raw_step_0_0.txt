Load: node_3 downward-left at 45°. To form a closed truss, members must connect all nodes in a loop: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, and node_1-node_2. Additional members may be added if needed but only 3 nodes exist. The truss is a triangle. Member lengths: node_1-node_2 = 6, node_1-node_3 = 2, node_3-node_2 = 4.47 approx. Select areas to keep stress within ±20 and mass ≤30. Use static equilibrium to estimate member forces. Load magnitude = 10 units at -45° => Fx = -7.07, Fy = -7.07. Assume linear elastic members, uniform areas per member from given discrete set.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Triangle truss with members: (1-2), (1-3), (3-2).

Load components Fx = -10*cos(45°) = -7.071, Fy = -10*sin(45°) = -7.071. Member lengths: L_12=6, L_13=2, L_32=√((6-2)^2 + 0^2)=4.0. But node_3 is at (2,0), node_2 at (6,0), so horizontal distance 4.0, vertical zero. So length_32=4.0. Areas discrete: 0:1,1:0.195,2:0.782,3:1.759,4:3.128,5:4.887,6:7.037,7:9.578,8:12.511,9:15.834,10:19.548.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Step 1: Support reactions. Sum Fx=0: R1x + R2x + Fx = 0. Roller at node_2 only vertical reaction R2y, no horizontal. So R2x=0. R1x = -Fx = 7.071. Sum Fy=0: R1y + R2y + Fy = 0. Sum moments about node_1: R2y*6 - Fy*2 = 0 => R2y = (Fy*2)/6 = (-7.071*2)/6 = -2.357. Then R1y = -Fy - R2y = 7.071 + 2.357 = 9.428. Step 2: Member forces. Use method of joints at node_3. Members: 1-3 and 3-2. At node_3 equilibrium Fx=0: F_13*cos(θ_13) + F_32*cos(θ_32) + Fx = 0. Fy=0: F_13*sin(θ_13) + F_32*sin(θ_32) + Fy = 0. θ_13: node_1(0,0) to node_3(2,0) horizontal right, angle=0°. θ_32: node_3(2,0) to node_2(6,0) horizontal right, angle=0°. So cos(0)=1, sin(0)=0. Equations: Fx: F_13 + F_32 -7.071=0, Fy: 0 + 0 -7.071=0 => Fy equilibrium at node_3 violated unless vertical members exist. So truss is colinear horizontally, no vertical support at node_3. This is unstable vertically. Need to add a node above node_3 to form a stable triangle in 2D with vertical components. Add node_4 at (2.0, 3.0). New nodes: node_4(2.0, 3.0). New members: 3-4, 4-1, 4-2. Now truss is closed polygon with 4 nodes. Recalculate lengths and forces with new geometry. Lengths: 1-4 = sqrt((2-0)^2 + (3-0)^2) = 3.605, 2-4 = sqrt((6-2)^2 + (0-3)^2) = 5.0, 3-4 = 3.0. Now, method of joints at node_3: members 1-3 (2.0), 3-4 (3.0), 3-2 (4.0). Forces resolved with vertical components. Approximate member forces by equilibrium, then calculate required areas. Assume max stress 20, area = force/20. Calculate mass = sum(length × area). Choose nearest discrete area from set. Final mass <30, max stress <20.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_final": "Added node_4 to stabilize truss vertically and form closed polygon.
