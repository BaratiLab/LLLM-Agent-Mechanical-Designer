  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under load with stress and mass constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 downward-left at 45°, supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current max stress 36.26 exceeds limit.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design has one member (member_6) overstressed at -36.26. Total mass 14.5 is within limit. Members near node_3 and node_4 carry high stress. Structure has a single top node (node_4). Load at node_3 is eccentric, causing high stress in diagonal members. Need to redistribute forces by adding nodes and members to reduce stress concentration. Areas can be increased for high stress members but better to add members to reduce load per member.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding an intermediate node between node_3 and node_4 or adding a node above node_3 to form a truss with more triangles can reduce stress. Remove or reduce length of overstressed member_6 or increase its area. Avoid large areas to control mass. Use area ids 2 or 3 for main load paths and 1 for less stressed members.",
  
  "proposal": "Add a new node (node_5) above node_3 at (2.0, 4.0) to form a triangulated truss with node_4. Connect node_5 to node_1, node_2, node_3, and node_4. Remove member_6 (node_3-node_4) or reduce area. Adjust member areas to keep stress within ±20 and total mass <30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 creates additional load paths, reducing stress in member_6 and others. Triangulation improves stability and load distribution. Member lengths and areas chosen to balance mass and stress. Areas selected from given discrete set, prioritizing smaller areas for less stressed members and moderate for main load paths.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_3(2,0) to node_5(2,4) length=4.0; node_5 to node_4(2,2.5) length=1.5; node_5 to node_1(0,0) length=~4.472; node_5 to node_2(6,0) length=~4.472. Assign areas: members with higher force get area 3 or 4, others 1 or 2. Remove or reduce area of overstressed member_6.",
  
  "calculation": "Estimated new total mass with added members and areas ~20-25, under max 30. Max stress expected <20 due to load redistribution. Member_6 replaced by two members node_3-node_5 and node_5-node_4 with moderate areas. Member_1 area increased to 2 to support load transfer. Members node_5-node_1 and node_5-node_2 area 2 for stability. Members node_1-node_3 and node_2-node_3 area 1 to reduce mass.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Check no duplicate nodes or members. Confirm load and support nodes unchanged. Member connections form stable triangulated structure. Areas from allowed set. Positions precise floats.",
