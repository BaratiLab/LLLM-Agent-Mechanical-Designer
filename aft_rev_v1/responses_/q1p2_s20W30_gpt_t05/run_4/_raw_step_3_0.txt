Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved up to 3.0 for better stress distribution.",\n  "analysis": "Stress is well below limits; mass is under max. Members with higher stress are member_4 (7.245) and member_2 (-5.495). Member areas chosen to balance mass and strength. Node_4 position at (2.0, 3.0) provides good geometry for force flow.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further moving node_4 up might reduce stress but increase mass. Reducing member areas risks exceeding stress limits. Current configuration is balanced.",\n  "reasoning": "Given the low max stress and mass close to but under limit, further optimization by moving node_4 or changing areas risks violating constraints or increasing mass. Load and support nodes fixed, so no node movement there. Current closed truss with 4 nodes and 6 members is efficient.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas produce member masses summing to 27.8375. Stress distribution is balanced with no member near Â±20. Small geometry adjustments unlikely to improve significantly.",\n  "calculation": "No changes made; verified stress and mass within constraints. Node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) optimal for load path.
