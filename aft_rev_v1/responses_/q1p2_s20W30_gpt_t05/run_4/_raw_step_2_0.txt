Load at node_3 (-10N, -45°). Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Current max stress 29.51 >20, mass 29.65 close to limit. Need to reduce stress in member_2 (-29.51) and overall stress, possibly redistribute load paths and adjust member areas.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current design has a high stress concentration in member_2 (node_1-node_3) under tensile load near -30, exceeding limit. Mass is near max. Members connecting node_5 add complexity and mass. Node_5 is added above node_4 but causes high stress and mass. Members from node_3 to node_5 and node_5 to others contribute to mass but not effectively reduce stress. The load is at node_3 close to supports, so efficient load transfer paths are essential. Current diagonal members from node_1 and node_2 to node_4 and node_3 are insufficient to reduce stress below limits.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_5 and its members to reduce mass and complexity. Increase height of node_4 to improve load path and reduce stress in bottom chord. Use stronger areas for critical tension members (node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2). Add diagonal bracing from node_4 to node_3 to better distribute load. Reassign areas to keep mass under 30 and stress under 20.",\n\n  "proposal": "Remove node_5 and related members. Keep nodes 1,2,3,4 with node_4 raised to 3.0m. Members: bottom chord node_1-node_2, tension chords node_1-node_3 and node_3-node_2 with increased area. Add diagonal from node_4 to node_3 and node_4 to node_2 for load transfer. Use areas: bottom chord moderate, diagonals larger for tension, vertical member node_1-node_4 moderate. This simpler truss reduces mass and stress.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Removing node_5 reduces mass and complexity. Increasing height of node_4 improves truss depth, reducing axial forces in bottom chord. Diagonal members from node_4 to node_3 and node_2 improve load distribution and reduce stress on node_1-node_3. Assign areas based on expected stress: largest areas on tension diagonals, moderate on compression members. Bottom chord area moderate to save mass. This layout is a classic Warren or Pratt truss variant, efficient for given load and supports.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and assign areas. Node positions: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (2,3).

Reduce m2 and m3 to 3 (1.759), m5 to 4 (3.128), m6 to 2 (0.782), m4 to 2 (0.782). Recalculate mass: m1=4.692, m2=3.518, m3=7.036, m4=2.346, m5=9.384, m6=3.227 total=30.2 close.
