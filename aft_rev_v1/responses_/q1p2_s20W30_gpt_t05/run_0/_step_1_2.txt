  "preamble": "Optimize truss to reduce max stress while maintaining constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 13.06 < 20, total mass 25.1 < 30, structure closed with 4 nodes and 5 members. Load at node_3, supports fixed at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller).",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_1 (-13.06), relatively high compression. Members 3,4,5 have low stresses. Mass is moderate, some members have large areas (3). Node_3 is on bottom chord between supports, node_4 is top node. Current member areas: 2 (0.782) for bottom chords, 3 (1.759) for diagonals and top chords. Load is downward left at 45 degrees on node_3.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, redistribute forces by adjusting node_4 position to better triangulate load path. Possibly move node_4 slightly right and up to reduce compression in member_1. Maintain node_1 and node_2 fixed. Consider reducing area of members with low stress to save mass and increase area of highly stressed member_1 if needed. Check if member lengths and angles reduce stress concentration.",
  
  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 right will increase angle of members 3 and 4, potentially reducing compression in member_1. Slight increase in height may improve load path. Reduce area of member_5 (currently 3) to area 2 (0.782) as its stress is low (-4.02). Increase area of member_1 to 3 (1.759) to reduce stress if needed. Member_2 area can remain same or slightly reduced. This balances stress and mass. Node_3 fixed at (2,0), node_1 and node_2 fixed. Move node_4 from (2,3) to approx (2.8,3.5) to improve triangulation.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member areas: 0=1,1=0.195,2=0.782,3=1.759,4=3.128. Current total mass 25.1. Target max stress <20. Adjust node_4 x from 2 to 2.8, y from 3 to 3.5. Change member_5 area from 3 to 2, member_1 from 2 to 3. Expect reduced compression in member_1 and lower stress overall. Mass should remain under 30. Members: member_1: ('node_1','node_3','3'), member_5: ('node_3','node_4','2').",
  
  "calculation": "New node_4: (2.8, 3.5). Members: member_1 area 3 (1.759), member_5 area 2 (0.782). Others unchanged. Expected member_1 stress reduced from -13.06 closer to -10 or less. Member_5 stress remains low, area reduced to save mass. Total mass estimated ~25.1 - (5.277 - (length_5*0.782)) + (length_1*(1.759-0.782)) ~ still under 30. This should reduce max stress and keep mass constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved to (2.8,3.5), member_1 area increased to 3, member_5 area decreased to 2. Other nodes and members unchanged. Load and supports fixed. Structure remains closed. Constraints met.",
