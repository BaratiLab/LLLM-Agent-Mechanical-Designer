Load at node_3, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_4 moved to (2.3,3.5). Members mostly area 2 or 3.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Stress is well below limit but member_3 has tensile stress 7.21 and member_5 compressive -9.07, indicating uneven force distribution. Mass is well under limit, so area sizes can be adjusted to reduce stress. Node_4 position affects force paths; slight repositioning may balance stresses. Current member layout is minimal closed truss with 5 members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider increasing height of node_4 slightly to reduce compression in member_5 and tensile in member_3. Could try slightly shifting node_4 horizontally to balance forces. Possibly increase area of member_5 to reduce stress. Avoid increasing total mass beyond 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing node_4 height increases member_3 and member_4 length, potentially reducing stress by changing force angles. Slight horizontal shift of node_4 may reduce bending in member_3 and member_5. Keep node_3 fixed due to load, node_1 and node_2 fixed due to supports. Use area 3 or 4 for members under high stress to reduce stress. Member_1 stress is moderate, area 3 is fine. Member_2 stress is low, keep area 2. Member_4 stress moderate, area 2 is acceptable. So increase member_5 area from 2 to 3 or 4 to reduce stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Current member areas: m1=3, m2=2, m3=2, m4=2, m5=2. Member lengths: m1 ~2.3, m2=4, m3~4.1, m4~4.1, m5~3.7. Mass = sum(length*area_factor). Max area factor tried =4 (3.128). Total mass will rise but stay below 30.
