Current design mass at 30.08 slightly over. Max stress 5.76 within limits. Load at node_3 downward-left. Supports fixed at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has member_5 with large area (4) and mass 11.641, major contributor to mass. Members near load node_3 have moderate stress and mass. Node_4 positioned at (2.4, 3.7) creates longer members. Reducing mass by lowering area on heavier members or repositioning node_4 to reduce member lengths can help. Stress is low, so some area reduction possible. Load is at node_3, so structure must transfer load efficiently to supports without excessive mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider reducing area of member_5 from 4 to 2 or 3, shorten member lengths by moving node_4 closer to node_3 and between supports, possibly (2.3, 3.0). Remove redundancy or unnecessary heavy members. Keep members connecting load node_3 to supports structurally efficient.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Move node_4 down to (2.3, 3.0) to shorten members. Reduce area of member_5 to \'2\'. Reduce area of member_3 and member_1 to \'2\' to lower mass. Maintain members connecting node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4 with reduced areas. This balances stress and mass within limits.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Shorter members reduce mass and stress. Lower areas reduce mass while stress remains below limits. Member_5 area reduction critical due to high mass contribution. Node_4 repositioned to optimize geometry for load transfer. Existing supports and load nodes fixed. Areas selected from given discrete set. This design should keep total mass under 30 and max stress under 20.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths with new node_4: node_1-node_4 length ≈ sqrt((2.3)^2 + (3.0)^2) ≈ 3.78, node_2-node_4 length ≈ sqrt((6-2.3)^2 + 3^2) ≈ 4.55, node_3-node_4 length ≈ sqrt((2.3-2)^2 + 3^2) ≈ 3.0.
