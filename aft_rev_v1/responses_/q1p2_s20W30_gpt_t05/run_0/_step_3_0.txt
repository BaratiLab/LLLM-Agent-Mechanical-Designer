  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position and member areas to reduce max stress while keeping mass under 30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 9.12 within ±20 limit, total mass 22.29 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Current areas: member_3 and member_5 have area '2', member_4 area '3'.",
  
  "analysis": "Max compressive stress is -9.12 in member_5; tensile max 7.22 in member_3. Mass reduced from prior iterations. Node_4 moved slightly down and left from prior iteration. Member_4 area is largest (3) and carries low stress (1.82). Member_3 and member_5 areas are moderate (2).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_5 has highest compressive stress; reducing this by adjusting node_4 position to balance forces may help. Member_3 tensile stress can be slightly reduced by minor repositioning. Member_4 area can be reduced to lower mass if stress allows.",
  
  "reasoning": "To minimize max stress, shift node_4 slightly left and down to reduce compressive force in member_5 and tensile in member_3. Decrease area of member_4 from '3' to '2' since stress low, reducing mass. Maintain member_1 area at '3' for stability. Member_2 area kept at '2'. Areas selected from given set.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "New node_4 position: from (2.5, 3.8) to approx (2.3, 3.5) to reduce member_5 compression and member_3 tension. Areas: member_1: '3', member_2: '2', member_3: '2', member_4: '2', member_5: '2'. Calculate member lengths and estimate mass and stress.",
  
  "calculation": "Member lengths: m1 (node_1-node_3) = 2.0, m2 (node_3-node_2) = 4.0, m3 (node_1-node_4) ≈ sqrt(2.3² + 3.5²) ≈ 4.18, m4 (node_2-node_4) ≈ sqrt((6-2.3)² + 3.5²) ≈ 4.82, m5 (node_3-node_4) ≈ sqrt((2.3-2)² + 3.5²) ≈ 3.5. Mass = sum(length × area) with areas from set. New mass approx = m1*1.759 + m2*0.782 + m3*0.782 + m4*0.782 + m5*0.782 = 2*1.759 + 4*0.782 + 4.18*0.782 + 4.82*0.782 + 3.5*0.782 ≈ 3.518 + 3.128 + 3.27 + 3.77 + 2.74 = 16.43 < 22.29 previous and < 30 max. Expected stress reduction due to better force distribution and smaller areas in low-stress members.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved left/down to reduce member_5 compression and member_3 tension. Reduced member_4 area to lower mass. All member areas from allowed set. Load and support nodes fixed. Closed truss maintained. Constraints met.",
