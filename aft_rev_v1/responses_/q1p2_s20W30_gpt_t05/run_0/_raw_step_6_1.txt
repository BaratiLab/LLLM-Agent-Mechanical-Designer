Current max stress is 13.66, total mass 13.73, both within limits. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. Node_4 moved from prior higher positions to (2.3,3.0). All members currently area_id \'2\' except members_1 and 2. Need to reduce max compressive stress on member_1 (-13.66) and tensile on member_3 (7.6).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_1 has highest compressive stress (-13.66) and is relatively light (mass 1.564). Member_3 tensile stress is 7.6 with mass 2.956. Member_5 compressive -9.09. Current areas all \'2\' except member_1 and 2 are \'2\'. Areas are moderate (0.782). Mass is well below limit (13.73 vs 30). We can increase area of highly stressed members to reduce stress. Node_4 position at (2.3, 3.0) is lower than previous iterations where stress was lower but mass was higher. Slightly raising node_4 might improve force distribution and reduce stress concentration on member_1. Members_3 and 5 connect node_4 to node_1 and node_3, adjusting node_4 vertically affects their length and force distribution.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing node_4 y-coordinate from 3.0 to around 3.5-3.7 may reduce compressive stress on member_1 by better triangulation. Increase area of member_1 and member_5 to reduce max stresses. Member_1 area from \'2\' to \'3\' (1.759) or \'4\' (3.128). Member_5 area from \'2\' to \'3\' or \'4\'. Member_3 area from \'2\' to \'3\' may reduce tensile stress. Mass budget allows this. Keep areas of members_2 and 4 as \'2\' to save mass. Avoid node moves for load/support nodes. Node_3 fixed at (2.0,0.0).",\n  \n  "reasoning": "By raising node_4 to about (2.4, 3.6), we can improve force path and reduce compressive stress on member_1. Increasing area of member_1 and member_5 reduces their stress by increasing cross-sectional area. Member_3 area increase reduces tensile stress. Since mass is well below 30, these changes are feasible. This should lower max stress below current 13.66, improving structure. No duplicate nodes or members, and all constraints satisfied.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Stress inversely proportional to area; increasing area reduces stress proportionally. Raising node_4 increases length of members 3,4,5 slightly, increasing mass but improving stress distribution. Member areas chosen from given set. Prior iterations showed node_4 at ~3.5-3.7 y gave lower max stress but higher mass. Now mass is low, so can afford slight increase in mass for stress improvement.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Set node_4 to (2.4, 3.6).

Estimate mass increase: member_1 length ~3.7 * 1.759=6.5, member_5 length ~3.2 * 3.128=10, member_3 length ~4.1 *1.759=7.2, members_2 and 4 lengths ~4*0.782=3.1 each.
