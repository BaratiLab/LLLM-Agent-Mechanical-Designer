  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to minimize stress under constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 9.28 < 20; mass 25.68 < 30; nodes with fixed supports and load; node_4 moved to reduce stress.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress reduced from 13.06 to 9.28 by moving node_4 higher and adjusting member areas. Member_5 still has highest compressive stress (-9.28). Mass increased slightly but within limit. Load at node_3 fixed; supports fixed at nodes 1 and 2. Further stress reduction possible by adjusting node_4 position to balance forces and possibly changing member areas to reduce stress concentration.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_5 under high compression; increasing height of node_4 reduces compression in member_5 but increases member_3 tension. Need to balance node_4 vertical position and possibly shift horizontally slightly within constraints to optimize force distribution.",

  "reasoning": "Increasing node_4 height reduces compression in member_5 but may increase tension in member_3. Horizontal shift of node_4 closer to node_3 can reduce member_5 length and stress. Member areas should be adjusted to maintain stress <20 and minimize mass. Use area 2 or 3 depending on member force. Avoid large mass increase. Node_3 and supports fixed; only node_4 movable.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Try node_4 at (2.5, 3.8) from (2.8, 3.5) to reduce member_5 compression; keep member areas as before or reduce member_3 area if tension low. Calculate member lengths and estimate stresses based on geometry and load. Ensure closed truss with 5 members. Check mass <=30 and max stress <=20.",

  "calculation": "Node positions: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(2.5,3.8). Member lengths: m1(2-0=2.0), m2(4.0), m3=sqrt((2.5)^2+3.8^2)=~4.57, m4=sqrt((3.5)^2+3.8^2)=~5.17, m5=sqrt((0.5)^2+3.8^2)=~3.83. Assign areas: member_1:3(1.759), member_2:2(0.782), member_3:2(0.782), member_4:3(1.759), member_5:2(0.782). Estimated mass: sum(length*area) ~ 2*1.759 + 4*0.782 + 4.57*0.782 + 5.17*1.759 + 3.83*0.782 = 3.518 + 3.128 + 3.57 + 9.09 + 3.0 = 22.3 < 30. Expected stress reduction due to shorter member_5 and balanced geometry. Max stress estimate <9.28.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 moved to (2.5, 3.8) reduces compression in member_5 and balances tension in member_3. Areas adjusted to reduce mass and stress. Constraints met with margin. Further improvement likely minimal. Stop next iteration if no better improvement.",
