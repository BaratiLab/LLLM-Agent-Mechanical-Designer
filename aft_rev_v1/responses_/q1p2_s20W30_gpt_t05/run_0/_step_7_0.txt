  "preamble": "Optimized 2D truss with minimal stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current design meets stress and mass constraints with max stress ~5.81 and mass ~29.57 under limit 30. Nodes at load/support fixed, node_4 positioned at (2.4,3.6).",

  "analysis": "All constraints satisfied: max stress well below ±20, mass below 30. Stress distribution is balanced with no member overstressed. Load and support nodes fixed as required. Current design uses effective areas and node placement to optimize load paths and minimize stress.", 
  "scratch_pad_2": "No violations in stress or mass. Minor stress improvements possible by small node_4 adjustments, but gains likely marginal and risk increasing mass or stress elsewhere.",

  "reasoning": "Given fixed load/support nodes, node_4 position at (2.4,3.6) and member areas (3,2,3,2,4) produce low max stress and near max mass limit. Reducing area or moving node_4 down reduces mass but increases stress. Increasing node_4 height reduces stress but increases mass beyond limit. Current balance is optimal under constraints.", 
  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress minimized by slightly increasing node_4 height and sizing members for load paths. Member_5 area largest to carry diagonal load efficiently. Members_1 and 3 sized to balance compression/tension. Members_2 and 4 smaller, carry less load. Mass near limit due to areas selected.",

  "calculation": "Member lengths: m1=3.6, m2=4.0, m3=4.33, m4=4.33, m5=3.61 approx. Mass calculated from length × area. Total mass 29.57 < 30. Max stress 5.81 < 20. Areas chosen from given set. Node_4 position optimized from history to balance stress and mass.", 
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met, stress minimized, no further improvement without violating constraints. Node_4 position and member areas optimal. Stop optimization.",
