Max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current max stress 29.05 (exceeds), total mass 15.55 (ok). Need to reduce stress especially in member_3 and member_4.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current design has high tensile stress in member_3 (29.05) and member_4 (20.15). Member_3 area is 0.195, member_4 area 0.195, both small. Increasing areas of these members can reduce stress but may increase mass. Also, node_4 at (2,3) is close to node_3 (2,0), causing high stress in vertical members. The diagonal member_5 has moderate stress -4.02. The horizontal members from node_1 to node_3 and node_3 to node_2 have low to moderate stress. The load direction suggests a diagonal load causing high tension in vertical members. Adding an additional node to better distribute forces may help.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding a node between node_4 and node_2 to create a more triangulated structure. Increase cross-section areas of highly stressed members. Possibly move node_4 slightly right and up for better force distribution. Keep supports and load nodes fixed. Avoid large increases in areas to stay within mass limit.",\n\n    "proposal": "Add node_5 at (4.0, 2.0) to create additional triangulation. Connect node_4 to node_5, node_5 to node_2, and node_3 to node_5. Increase area of member_3 and member_4 to area_id \'2\' (0.782) to reduce stress. Use moderate areas for new members. Keep other members as is or slightly adjusted.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Adding node_5 creates smaller triangles, distributing load better and reducing stress concentration. Increasing area of vertical members reduces tensile stress. New members provide alternate load paths. Areas chosen balance stress reduction and mass increase.
