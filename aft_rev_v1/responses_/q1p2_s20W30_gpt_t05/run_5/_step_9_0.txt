  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 and node_5 positions to reduce max stress while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 13.43 < 20, total mass 27.02 < 30, load at node_3, supports fixed. Areas mostly fixed. Nodes 1,2,3 fixed; can move 4 and 5.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress concentrated on member_1 (-13.43) and member_3 (7.45). Member_1 is compressive, member_3 tensile. Members 4 and 5 have intermediate stresses. Members 6,7,8 low stress. Current mass close to limit but acceptable. Node_4 at (2.4,3.3) and node_5 at (2.6,1.4).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing compression in member_1 may reduce max stress. Adjusting node_4 upward slightly may reduce bending and compressive stress. Moving node_5 slightly closer to node_3 may reduce stress in members 6,7,8 and redistribute forces. Maintain closed truss and connectivity. Avoid increasing member lengths significantly.",
  
  "reasoning": "Increase node_4 y-coordinate slightly to reduce compression in member_1 by better load path. Slightly move node_5 closer to node_3 horizontally and downward to reduce stress in members 6,7,8 and balance forces. Keep node_5 y > 1.2 to maintain geometry and avoid buckling. Areas remain same to keep mass stable.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4: from (2.4,3.3) to (2.4,3.5). Node_5: from (2.6,1.4) to (2.5,1.3). Check member lengths and estimate mass impact minimal. Expect member_1 stress to reduce from -13.43 to ~ -12.5, member_3 tensile stress to reduce slightly. Total mass remains ~27.",
  
  "calculation": "Member lengths: member_1 length ~2.4 to (2.4,3.5) ~ sqrt((2.4-0)^2 + (3.5-0)^2)=~4.27 (was ~3.95), slight increase. Member_6 length reduces slightly, member_7 length slightly reduces. Mass impact negligible. Stress expected to reduce due to better load path. Constraints satisfied.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New node positions within design space, no constraint violation, expected stress reduction, mass within limit, closed truss maintained, no duplicate nodes or members.",
