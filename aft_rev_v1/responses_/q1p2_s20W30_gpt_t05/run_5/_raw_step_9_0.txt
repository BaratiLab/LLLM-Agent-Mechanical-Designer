Avoid increasing member lengths significantly.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increase node_4 y-coordinate slightly to reduce compression in member_1 by better load path. Slightly move node_5 closer to node_3 horizontally and downward to reduce stress in members 6,7,8 and balance forces. Keep node_5 y > 1.2 to maintain geometry and avoid buckling.
