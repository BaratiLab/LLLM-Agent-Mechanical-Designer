Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 and node_5 moved in previous iterations to optimize stress.",\n  "analysis": "Stress is well below allowable limits; mass is close to but below max. Minor improvements in stress possible by repositioning nodes, but gains are marginal. The structure is stable, closed, and uses appropriate member areas.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Further node movements risk increasing stress or mass. Member areas are balanced to handle load. Load and supports fixed, so node_4 and node_5 are only movable nodes.",\n  "reasoning": "Member_1 has highest compressive stress (-13.06), but well below limit (-20). Other members have low stresses. Mass is near limit but not exceeded. Current node positions create an efficient load path minimizing stress. Further node adjustments previously attempted show diminishing returns.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress and mass constraints met. Node_4 at (2.4,3.6) and node_5 at (2.45,1.2) yield balanced stresses. Member areas chosen from allowed set. No duplicate nodes or members. Load/support nodes fixed.",\n  "calculation": "No changes to node positions or member areas recommended.
