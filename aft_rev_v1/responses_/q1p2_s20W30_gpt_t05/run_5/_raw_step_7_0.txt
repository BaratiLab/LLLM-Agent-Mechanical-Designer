Load at node_3, supports fixed. Current high compressive stress at member_1 (-13.43).",\n  "analysis": "Member_1 has highest compressive stress. Members around node_4 and node_5 show moderate stresses. Slightly lowering node_4 may reduce compressive stress in member_1 by changing force distribution. Moving node_5 closer to node_4 and slightly down may reduce stress in members connected to node_5. Areas are fixed; only node positions can change except supports and load nodes.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Check if lowering node_4 from y=3.3 to ~3.0 and moving node_5 from (3.0,1.7) to (2.8,1.5) reduces stress in member_1 and others. Keep node_3 fixed at (2.0,0.0).",\n  "reasoning": "Lowering node_4 reduces vertical force arm, reducing compression in member_1. Moving node_5 closer to node_4 shortens members 6,7,8, reducing their stresses and mass slightly. This should maintain a closed truss and keep mass under 30. Areas remain same to keep mass stable.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths recomputed: member_1 length ~ sqrt((2-0)^2+(3.0-0)^2)=3.6055; previously ~3.86. Member_6 length shorter -> less stress.
