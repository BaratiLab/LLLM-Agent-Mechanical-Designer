  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to reduce max stress while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 13.86 < 20, mass 25.9 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 and node_5 positions can be adjusted. Areas fixed for members. Goal: reduce stress further by node repositioning.",
  
  "analysis": "Max compressive stress in member_1 (-13.86) is dominant. Members near node_4 and node_5 have lower stress. Mass is below limit, so slight increase in some member areas or lengths is possible if it reduces stress. Load at node_3 is downward-left (-10, -45deg). Node_3 fixed at (2,0), node_1 at (0,0), node_2 at (6,0). Node_4 at (2.4,3.0) and node_5 at (2.8,1.5) can be moved to optimize force distribution. Members form a closed truss with 8 members.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider raising node_4 slightly to improve force distribution in members 3 and 4. Move node_5 closer to node_4 to reduce bending and stress concentrations. Slightly reduce horizontal offset of node_5 to distribute forces better between members 6,7,8. Maintain closure and no member overlap.",
  
  "reasoning": "Increasing height of node_4 will increase vertical component in members 3 and 4 reducing bending stress. Bringing node_5 closer to node_4 shortens members 6 and 8, reducing stress in those members. Slightly shifting node_5 left reduces stress in member 7 which connects node_5 and node_2. Keep areas as is to avoid mass increase. Final positions must keep structure closed and stable with no duplicate nodes or connections.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths and angles after node moves. Calculate approximate length changes and their effect on stress. Member_1 length fixed from node_1 to node_3 (2.0m). Member_3 and 4 lengths depend on node_4 position. Member_6,7,8 lengths depend on node_5 position. Stress roughly proportional to force/area, so by optimizing geometry, forces can be balanced better.",
  
  "calculation": "Current node_4: (2.4,3.0), node_5: (2.8,1.5). Propose node_4: (2.4,3.3) (+0.3m y), node_5: (2.6,1.4) (shift left 0.2, down 0.1). This increases height of node_4, reduces horizontal offset and length of members connected to node_5, likely reducing max stress. Mass impact minimal as member areas unchanged. Check closure: members connect nodes properly, no duplicates.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no violation of max stress Â±20, mass <30. Expected max stress to reduce below current 13.86. Mass slightly changed but within limit. Load and supports unchanged. No node movement for node_1, node_2, node_3. Members and areas unchanged. Ready to update node positions and keep member dict same.",
