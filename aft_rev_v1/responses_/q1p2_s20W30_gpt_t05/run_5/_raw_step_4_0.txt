High compressive stress on member_1 (-13.9) and tensile on member_3 (7.7). Members around node_4 and node_5 have moderate stress. Node_4 and node_5 positions can be slightly adjusted to better distribute forces and reduce peak stress. Areas chosen mostly mid-range (2 or 3).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on repositioning node_4 and node_5 to balance force paths; consider slightly shortening or changing angles of high-stress members; keep areas same or reduce if stress is low to save mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_1 is under highest compression; reducing its length or improving force distribution around node_4 can reduce stress. Node_4 moved slightly upward and left to reduce bending and compressive load on member_1. Node_5 moved slightly closer to node_4 to reduce length and stress in members 6,7,8.
