  "preamble": "Optimize node positions to reduce max stress while respecting mass and stress constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 13.24 < 20, total mass 27.35 < 30, structure stable. Load at node_3 fixed, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Nodes 4 and 5 movable.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is dominated by member_1 (-13.24), compression. Members with high stress are member_1, member_3, member_5. Mass is near limit but not exceeded. Current layout has node_4 at (2.3,3.3), node_5 at (3.5,2.1). The truss is closed and stable. To reduce stress, better distribute forces by adjusting node_4 and node_5 positions to reduce member_1 compression and member_3 tension.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_4 slightly right and down to reduce length and stress in member_1 and member_3. Move node_5 slightly left or down to balance forces in members connected to it. Keep load/support nodes fixed.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_1 is highly compressed; shortening or changing angle can reduce stress. Member_3 tension can be reduced by lowering node_4. Member_5 compression can be improved by adjusting node_4 and node_5 relative positions. Area selections seem appropriate; no change needed now. Small node moves can improve force distribution and reduce max stress.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Try node_4 at (2.5,3.0) to reduce height and node_5 at (3.3,1.9) to reduce lever arm. Recalculate member lengths and estimate stress reduction. Ensure no member length too short or long to avoid high stress or mass increase. Mass should remain under 30.",
  
  "calculation": "New node positions: node_4 (2.5,3.0), node_5 (3.3,1.9). Member lengths recalculated. Expected member_1 length reduces, lowering compression stress. Member_3 length reduces, lowering tension. Member_5 length slightly reduced, lowering compression. Mass change minimal, total mass ~27.2. Max stress estimated to drop below 13.0.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Positions valid, no duplicate nodes or members, constraints met. Stress and mass within limits. Further small improvements possible but diminishing returns expected.",
