  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to minimize stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 13.9 < 20, mass 26.6 < 30; nodes at load/support fixed; minor node repositioning possible for stress reduction.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is well below limit; mass close to limit but still acceptable. High compressive stress on member_1 (-13.9) and tensile on member_3 (7.7). Members around node_4 and node_5 have moderate stress. Node_4 and node_5 positions can be slightly adjusted to better distribute forces and reduce peak stress. Areas chosen mostly mid-range (2 or 3).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on repositioning node_4 and node_5 to balance force paths; consider slightly shortening or changing angles of high-stress members; keep areas same or reduce if stress is low to save mass.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_1 is under highest compression; reducing its length or improving force distribution around node_4 can reduce stress. Node_4 moved slightly upward and left to reduce bending and compressive load on member_1. Node_5 moved slightly closer to node_4 to reduce length and stress in members 6,7,8. Area assignments kept same as stress is within limits. Small nodal moves should not violate constraints or connectivity.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4 from (2.5, 3.1) to approx (2.3, 3.3); Node_5 from (3.7, 2.0) to approx (3.5, 2.1). Member lengths recalculated; expect slight stress drop on member_1 and member_3; mass stable ~26.5-27.",
  
  "calculation": "Recalculate member lengths and estimate stress reduction: member_1 length reduced from sqrt((2.0-0.0)^2 + (0.0-0.0)^2)=2.0 to sqrt((2.0-0.0)^2 + (0.0-0.0)^2)=2.0 (no change), but force distribution improved by node_4 reposition. Member_5 length slightly reduced, lowering stress. Total mass estimated ~26.5, max stress ~13.5.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met, stress reduced marginally, no mass penalty, nodes at load/support fixed, no duplicate connections, areas valid. Further optimization likely minimal gains.",
