  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to reduce max stress while respecting mass and stress constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 14.07 < 20, mass 22.06 < 30; loads at node_3, supports fixed at node_1 and node_2; node_4 and node_5 movable.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_1 has highest compressive stress (-14.07), member_3 moderate tensile (7.85). Mass is moderate. Node_4 and node_5 positions influence load path and stress distribution. Member areas mostly mid-range (1 to 3). Current structure is stable and closed. Optimization can focus on repositioning node_4 and node_5 to reduce stress concentrations and possibly reduce member areas.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing compressive stress in member_1 by adjusting node_4 upward/right and node_5 slightly to redistribute forces; possibly reduce area of low stressed members (e.g., member_8).",
  
  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 slightly higher and more right can reduce bending and compressive load on member_1 by better load transfer. Moving node_5 slightly upward and left can improve triangulation and reduce stresses in members connected to node_5. Reducing area of member_8 from 1 to 0.782 (area_id '2') is possible given low stress (-0.83). Check if member_6 and member_7 areas can be slightly reduced from 1 to 0.782. Maintain closed truss by keeping all members. Node_3 and support nodes fixed per instructions.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Adjust node_4 from (2.5,3.0) to about (2.7,3.3), node_5 from (4.0,2.0) to (3.8,2.2). Reduce member_8 area from '1' to '2'. Possibly reduce member_6 and member_7 from '1' to '2'. Verify stress and mass after these changes.",
  
  "calculation": "New node_4: (2.7, 3.3), node_5: (3.8, 2.2). Member_8 area '2' (0.782), member_6 and member_7 area '2' (0.782). This should reduce mass by ~0.3 and reduce stress in member_1 by better force distribution. Total mass estimated ~21.7 < 30, max stress expected <14.07 due to improved geometry and reduced member areas in low stress members.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes or members. Load and support nodes unchanged. All members maintained for closed truss. Areas selected from allowed set. Positions precise floats.",
