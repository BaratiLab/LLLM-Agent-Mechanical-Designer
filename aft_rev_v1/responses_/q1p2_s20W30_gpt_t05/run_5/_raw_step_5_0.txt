Load at node_3 fixed, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Nodes 4 and 5 movable.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress is dominated by member_1 (-13.24), compression. Members with high stress are member_1, member_3, member_5. Mass is near limit but not exceeded. Current layout has node_4 at (2.3,3.3), node_5 at (3.5,2.1). The truss is closed and stable. To reduce stress, better distribute forces by adjusting node_4 and node_5 positions to reduce member_1 compression and member_3 tension.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_4 slightly right and down to reduce length and stress in member_1 and member_3. Move node_5 slightly left or down to balance forces in members connected to it. Keep load/support nodes fixed.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_1 is highly compressed; shortening or changing angle can reduce stress. Member_3 tension can be reduced by lowering node_4. Member_5 compression can be improved by adjusting node_4 and node_5 relative positions. Area selections seem appropriate; no change needed now. Small node moves can improve force distribution and reduce max stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Try node_4 at (2.5,3.0) to reduce height and node_5 at (3.3,1.9) to reduce lever arm.
