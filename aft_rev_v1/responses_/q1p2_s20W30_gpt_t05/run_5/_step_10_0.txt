  "preamble": "Optimize node positions to reduce max stress while satisfying constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 13.18 < 20, total mass 27.77 < 30, load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 and node_5 movable.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is mostly in member_1 (-13.18), slightly high but within limit. Mass is close to limit (27.77). Members mostly use area 2 or 3. Node_4 moved up to 3.5 and node_5 near 1.3. To reduce stress, slightly reposition node_4 and node_5 to better distribute forces and reduce axial stress in critical members. Member_1 stress is compressive and high, so increasing vertical height of node_4 may help reduce bending moment and compressive stress in member_1. Also, adjusting node_5 closer to node_3 and node_4 may reduce stress in members 6,7,8. Avoid increasing member lengths too much to keep mass under 30.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_4 slightly higher (3.6) and node_5 slightly left and down (2.45, 1.2). Maintain member areas as is for now to keep mass stable. Check if stress reduces in member_1 and others.",
  
  "reasoning": "Increasing node_4 height increases truss stiffness and reduces compressive stress in member_1 by providing better load path. Adjusting node_5 closer to node_3 and node_4 shortens members 6 and 8, reducing mass and stress. Keep areas stable to avoid mass increase. Load and support nodes fixed as per constraints. Ensuring no duplicate members or nodes. Members remain connected as before to maintain closed truss. This small adjustment aims to reduce max stress below current 13.18 while keeping mass below 30.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4: (2.4, 3.5) -> (2.4, 3.6) (+0.1 in y). Node_5: (2.5,1.3) -> (2.45,1.2) (-0.05 in x, -0.1 in y). Member areas unchanged: members 1,3,4,5,6,7,8 same areas. Mass estimated to remain ~27.7. Expect stress member_1 reduce from -13.18 to ~-12.5, others slightly better distributed.",
  
  "calculation": "Length member_1: node_1(0,0) to node_3(2,0) = 2.0. No change. Stress reduction from better vertical support from node_4. Length member_6: node_4(2.4,3.6) to node_5(2.45,1.2) ~ 2.4, slightly less than before ~2.2. Minor mass reduction. Overall mass stable. Max stress expected to drop due to better load distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Confirm no nodes changed for load/support nodes. No duplicate members. Areas unchanged to keep mass stable. Small node position changes to further reduce max stress from 13.18 to below 13. Final design within constraints, continue optimization in next steps if needed.",
