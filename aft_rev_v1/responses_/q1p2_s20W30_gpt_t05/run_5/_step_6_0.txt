  "preamble": "Optimize nodal positions to reduce max stress while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 14.07 < 20 limit, total mass 26.05 < 30 limit. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed. Nodes 4 and 5 movable.",
  
  "analysis": "Max compressive stress is on member_1 (-14.07), tensile max ~7.85 on member_3. Mass is under limit but close. Members with high stress are mostly near node_1 and node_3. Node_4 and node_5 positions affect stress distribution and member forces. Member areas are mostly 2 or 3, which are moderate. Slight reposition of nodes 4 and 5 can balance forces and reduce peak stress.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on lowering compressive stress in member_1 by adjusting node_4 upward and slightly left to redistribute axial forces. Move node_5 slightly closer to node_4 and slightly lower to reduce bending and stress concentration. Maintain closed truss connectivity and no duplicate members.",
  
  "reasoning": "Increasing height of node_4 increases member_3 and member_4 lengths, reducing force concentration on member_1. Moving node_5 closer to node_4 reduces member_6 length and stress. Slight horizontal adjustments can balance tensile and compressive forces. Areas remain same for now to keep mass under limit. Small nodal position changes can reduce max stress without increasing mass.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and forces roughly proportional to nodal distances. Stress = force/area, so redistributing geometry can reduce peak stress. Mass = sum(length * area). Keep areas fixed to avoid mass increase. Check that max stress stays below 20 and mass below 30.",
  
  "calculation": "Adjust node_4 from (2.5, 3.0) to (2.4, 3.3) to increase height and slightly left. Adjust node_5 from (3.3, 1.9) to (3.0, 1.7) to shorten member_6 and reduce stress. Keep other nodes fixed. Areas unchanged. Expect member_1 compressive stress to reduce from -14.07 to ~-12.5 and max tensile stress from 7.85 to ~7.0. Mass estimated to remain ~26.0.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes/members, load/support nodes fixed, closed truss maintained. Constraints met with margin. Optimization can continue if needed but current step improves stress.",
