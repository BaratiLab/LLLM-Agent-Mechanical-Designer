Load at node_3 (-10, -45°). Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Current max stress 35.32 > 20, mass 29.14 < 30. Need to reduce max stress, especially member_11 (35.32).",\n\n  "analysis": "Current design has excessive stress in member_11 (node_5-node_2) and member_2 (node_3-node_2). Member areas are mostly large. Structure complexity with nodes 4,5,6,7 is good for load path but member sizing and topology can be improved. Load at node_3 induces tension/compression in members connected to node_2 and node_5. Member_11 stress is tensile and too high. Mass is near limit, so increasing cross-section indiscriminately is not an option.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing stress in member_11 by redistributing forces, possibly adding a diagonal member from node_3 to node_7 or node_6 to provide alternate load path. Reduce area of overstressed members and increase area of critical load path members moderately. Consider moving node_7 closer to node_2 horizontally to reduce member length and stress. Possibly remove redundant members with zero stress to reduce mass.",\n\n  "proposal": "Modify structure by: 1) Adding member from node_3 to node_7 to share load. 2) Slightly move node_7 horizontally to (4.2, 3.5) to shorten member_10 and reduce stress. 3) Reduce area of member_11 from \'1\' to \'0\' (max area 1) to reduce stress. 4) Increase area of member_2 from \'1\' to \'2\' to better carry load. 5) Keep other members as is, but remove member_9 (node_6-node_7) with zero stress to reduce mass. 6) Keep node positions except node_7 moved as above.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Adding member_3-7 creates an alternative load path, reducing stress on member_11. Moving node_7 closer to node_2 reduces member length and stress. Increasing area of member_2 balances load transfer. Removing zero stress member reduces mass. This keeps total mass under 30 and max stress under 20 per constraints.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths and areas: member_11 length ~distance node_5(2.3,3.5) to node_2(6,0) ~4.72. Area reduced from \'1\' (0.195) to \'0\' (1) is not possible since \'0\' area is 1 (largest?). Actually area \'0\' corresponds to 1, \'1\' to 0.195, so reduce area from \'1\' to \'1\' is minimal. So better to reduce area of member_11 from \'1\' (0.195) to \'0\' (1) is increasing area, so not good. So reduce from \'1\' (0.195) to \'0\' (1) is increasing? So keep \'1\' for member_11 but add member_3-7 with area \'2\' or \'1\' to share load. Increase member_2 area from \'1\' (0.195) to \'2\' (0.782) to reduce stress. Node_7 moved from (4.5,3.5) to (4.2,3.5). Remove member_9 (node_6-node_7).",\n\n  "calculation": "Member lengths: member_11 length ~4.72, member_3-7 length ~distance node_3(2,0) to node_7(4.2,3.5) ~3.96. Areas assigned: member_3-7 area \'2\' (0.782), member_2 area \'2\' (0.782), member_11 area remain \'1\' (0.195). Total mass estimated to remain below 30. Expected max stress reduced below 20 due to load sharing.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes/members, supports and load nodes unchanged except node_7 position.
