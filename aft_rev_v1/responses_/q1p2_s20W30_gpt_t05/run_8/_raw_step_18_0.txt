Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current mass 44.08 too high. Stress max 9.04 within limit but mass exceeds.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure uses large areas (3 and 4) causing high mass. Members are long and heavy. Load is on node_3, which is mid-span. Nodes 4 and 5 placed high to form triangular bracing. Current design is stable but overweight. Reducing member areas and optimizing node 5 position could reduce mass. Also, removing redundant members or shortening long members will help. Current max stress is low, so some reduction in area is possible.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Keep nodes 1, 2, 3 fixed. Move node_5 to reduce member lengths and mass. Possibly remove member_7 (node_5-node_2) if not critical. Use smaller areas for members under low stress. Keep triangular bracing with nodes 4 and 5 for stability. Use areas mostly 1 or 2 for light members, 3 for main load paths.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Maintain nodes 1, 2, 3. Node_4 at (3.5, 4.0), node_5 moved to (2.5, 2.5) to shorten members. Members: node_1-node_3 area 2, node_3-node_2 area 2, node_1-node_4 area 1, node_4-node_2 area 1, node_3-node_5 area 1, node_5-node_4 area 1. Remove member node_5-node_2 to reduce mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Reducing area ids from 4 and 3 to 1 and 2 reduces mass significantly. Moving node_5 closer to node_3 and node_4 reduces member lengths and thus mass. Removing member_7 cuts mass and complexity. Triangular bracing remains with nodes 3,4,5 to distribute load and maintain stiffness. Stress should remain below 20 due to load reduction on members by smaller areas and shorter lengths.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_2 = 4.0, node_1-node_4 ≈ 5.315, node_4-node_2 ≈ 2.5, node_3-node_5 ≈ 1.58, node_5-node_4 ≈ 1.58. Mass = sum(length × area_factor). Area factors: 1=0.195, 2=0.782. Mass estimate = (2*0.782)+(4*0.782)+(5.315*0.195)+(2.5*0.195)+(1.58*0.195)+(1.58*0.195) ≈ 1.56+3.13+1.04+0.487+0.308+0.308=6.83 <30. Stress expected <20 due to smaller areas and stable geometry.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Mass = 6.83 (well below 30).
