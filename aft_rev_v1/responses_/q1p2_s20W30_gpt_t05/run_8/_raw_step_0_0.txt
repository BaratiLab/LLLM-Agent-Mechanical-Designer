To form a closed truss, need at least one additional node above or below line to form triangle(s). Triangular truss is simplest closed shape. Supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller provide statically determinate support. Load applied at node_3 needs support via members. Adding one node (node_4) above line near node_3 to form triangle node_1-node_4-node_3 and node_4-node_3-node_2 will create closed loop and distribute load. Use truss members connecting all nodes to form closed loop: members (1-3), (3-2), (1-4), (4-2), (3-4).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (3.5, 3.0) approx to create triangle with nodes 1,3,4 and 4,3,2.

Use member length × area as mass proxy. Use simplified truss force analysis for stress estimation.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "To minimize stress, members directly carrying load should have larger area. Members in tension/compression analyzed using method of joints. Load at node_3 (-10 at -45°) decomposes into Fx = -10*cos45= -7.07 left, Fy= -7.07 down. Supports at node_1 and node_2 react accordingly. Triangular geometry distributes forces. Select member areas starting from smallest (0.195) and increase only where stresses approach limit.
