Load at node_3: -10 N at -45°. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current max stress 40.54 > 20, total mass 29.79 close to limit. Stress concentrates on member_9 (-40.54). Members with zero stress (6,7,8) can be reconsidered. Current topology has redundant members causing high stress in member_9. The load is applied at node_3 on bottom chord, so truss geometry and member sizing should be adjusted to redistribute forces and reduce stress concentrations.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove low-stress members to reduce mass and complexity. Add diagonal bracing between top nodes and bottom chord to improve load path. Adjust node_5 and node_6 positions for better force distribution. Use smaller areas on low force members and larger areas on critical members. Keep supports and loaded nodes fixed.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove member_9 (node_5-node_4) causing high stress. Reposition node_5 closer to node_4 but slightly lower to reduce compression. Add member from node_5 to node_2 for better load path. Adjust areas: use area_id 3 or 4 for main chords, 2 or 1 for diagonals. Retain node_6 at (3.0,4.0) for top support. Finalize with 7 members to reduce mass and stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing member_9 eliminates stress concentration. Adding member_5-node_2 improves force distribution under load at node_3. Slightly lowering node_5 reduces compression in members connected to it. Using moderate area sizes balances mass and strength. The truss geometry forms a stable triangular framework minimizing bending and shear.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and assign areas: main chords (node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2) length ~2 and 4, use area 4 (3.128). Diagonals length ~3 to 4, area 2 (0.782). Short members like node_4-node_5 ~1.5, area 1 (0.195). Total mass estimate below 30. Check max stress by reducing area in low force members and increasing in high force members.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3=2.0, node_3-node_2=4.0, node_1-node_4=3.54, node_4-node_2=3.54, node_3-node_5=1.58, node_5-node_6=2.0, node_6-node_2=3.6, node_5-node_2=3.16. Area assignments: main chords area_id 4 (3.128), diagonals area_id 2 (0.782), short braces area_id 1 (0.195). Mass sum = Σ length × area ≈ 29.5 < 30.
