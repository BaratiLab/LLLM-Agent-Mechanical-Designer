Current max stress 57.41 > 20, mass 14.64 < 30. Need to reduce stress drastically, especially member_1 (-57.41) and member_5 (-36.98).",\n  \n  "analysis": "High compressive stress on member_1 (node_1-node_3) and member_5 (node_3-node_5) indicates these members are overloaded. Areas are minimal (area_id 1 = 0.195) for these members. Increasing cross-sectional areas there helps reduce stress. Also, current geometry places node_5 close to node_3 and node_4, creating long slender members with low area. Node_6 is at (4.0, 2.5) but members connected to it have low area, not effective in load transfer. The load direction (-45°) induces tension and compression in diagonal members connected to node_3. To reduce stress, better triangulation and load path is needed with larger areas on critical members. Mass constraint allows some increase in member areas.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding a new intermediate node between node_3 and node_2 or node_5 and node_2 to better distribute load. Increase areas on members from node_1 to node_3, node_3 to node_5, and node_5 to node_2. Possibly increase height of node_4 or reposition node_6 for better triangulation. Avoid very long members with small areas. Use area_id 3 (1.759) or 4 (3.128) for critical members. Keep mass ≤ 30.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep existing nodes fixed for supports and loads (node_1, node_2, node_3). Move node_5 slightly upward and left to (2.3, 3.5) for better triangulation. Move node_6 to (3.8, 3.0). Add new node_7 at (4.5, 3.5) to improve load path to node_2. Members: node_1-node_3 (area 3), node_3-node_5 (area 3), node_5-node_4 (area 2), node_5-node_6 (area 2), node_6-node_4 (area 1), node_6-node_7 (area 2), node_7-node_2 (area 3), node_5-node_2 (area 1), node_4-node_2 (area 2), node_3-node_2 (area 1). This structure improves triangulation and load distribution.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing areas on members with highest stress reduces stress magnitude. Adding node_7 near node_2 provides an alternative load path, reducing stress on node_5-node_2 and node_3-node_2. Moving node_5 upward and left increases member angles, reducing axial forces. Node_6 repositioned to improve load transfer. Triangulation ensures stability. Areas chosen balance mass and stress: critical members get area 3 or 4, less critical area 1 or 2.
