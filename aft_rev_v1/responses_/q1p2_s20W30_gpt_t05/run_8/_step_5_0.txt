  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to meet stress ±20 and mass ≤30 constraints under given load/supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 with magnitude 10 at -45°, supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current max stress 135.98 exceeds ±20, mass 22.3 is under limit. Need stress reduction mainly in member_7 and member_4, 6.",
  "analysis": "Current design has high compressive stress (-135.98) on member_7 (node_6-node_2) and high tensile stress on members 4 and 6. Member_7 has smallest area '1' but highest stress indicating it is overloaded. Node_6 placement at (3.0,4.0) causes long members with high stresses. The truss lacks adequate triangulation near node_2 to distribute load effectively.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress, increase areas on critical members or rearrange nodes to shorten high-stress members. Adding a node closer to node_2 and redistributing members can reduce stress on member_7. Avoid large member lengths and small areas on heavily loaded members.",
  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (4.5, 2.0) to create better triangulation near node_2. Connect node_5 to node_2, node_4, and node_6. Remove member_7 (node_6-node_2) to avoid high compressive stress. Increase area of members near node_2 and node_5 to moderate levels. Keep existing load/support nodes fixed. Areas selected from given set to balance mass and stress.",
  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 near node_2 creates shorter members to distribute forces, reducing load on member_7. Removing member_7 eliminates the overstressed member. Using medium areas (2 or 3) on new and critical members balances mass and strength. Triangulation ensures stability and stress distribution under combined vertical and horizontal loads from node_3.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_5-node_2 ≈ sqrt((6-4.5)^2 + (0-2)^2) = 2.5, node_5-node_4 ≈ sqrt((4.5-3.5)^2 + (2-3)^2) = 1.414, node_5-node_6 ≈ sqrt((4.5-3)^2 + (2-4)^2) = 2.5. Assign area '3' to node_5-node_2, '2' to node_5-node_4 and node_5-node_6. Members from node_3 to node_6 and node_4 remain with area '2' or '3' as needed. Total mass estimated under 30 with these area choices.",
  "calculation": "Sum member lengths × area: member_1 (node_1-node_3): length 2.0, area 3 → mass 6.0; member_2 (node_3-node_2): length 4.0, area 3 → 12.0; member_3 (node_1-node_4): length ~4.6097, area 2 → 9.06; member_4 (node_4-node_2): length ~2.5, area 2 → 5.0; member_5 (node_3-node_6): length ~4.472, area 2 → 8.78; member_6 (node_4-node_6): length ~1.414, area 2 → 2.83; member_8 (node_5-node_2): 2.5, area 3 → 7.5; member_9 (node_5-node_4): 1.414, area 2 → 2.83; member_10 (node_5-node_6): 2.5, area 2 → 5.0. Total mass ~59 (too high), reduce some areas to '1' or '0.782' to keep mass ≤30.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Reduce member_2 area to '1' (0.195), member_1 area to '2' (0.782), member_5 area to '1' (0.195), member_3 and 4 area to '1' (0.195), member_6 and new members area to '1' or '0.782'. Estimated mass now under 30. Stress expected within ±20 due to better triangulation and member sizing.",
