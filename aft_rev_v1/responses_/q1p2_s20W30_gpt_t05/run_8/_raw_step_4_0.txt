Current design has excessive stress on member_6 (-472). Load at node_3 downward-left. Supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. Need to reduce stress concentration and balance load paths.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current structure has high compressive stress in member_6 connecting node_5 and node_4. This suggests member_6 is overloaded. Node_5 is close to node_3 and node_4, creating a short, highly stressed member. The load at node_3 is large, and the triangular top structure with node_4 and node_5 may be causing stress concentration. The members from node_3 to node_5 and node_5 to node_4 are critical. The mass is within limits but stress is not. The areas used are moderate (2 and 3).",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, consider removing node_5 or repositioning it higher and more centered to distribute forces better. Adding a new node above node_4 to form a stiffer triangular truss might help. Increase area of critical members or redistribute members to shorten long members or reduce bending. Maintain pinned and roller supports at nodes 1 and 2. Avoid member_6 overload by reducing length or changing connectivity.",\n\n  "proposal": "Remove node_5, add a new node_6 at (3.0, 4.0) above node_4 to form a stiffer truss top. Connect node_3 and node_4 to node_6. Connect node_6 to node_2. Keep base nodes and members from node_1 to node_3 and node_3 to node_2. Use areas to reduce stress: area_id \'3\' for main bottom chords, \'2\' for verticals/diagonals, and \'1\' or \'0\' for less stressed members. This creates a stable triangular truss with better load distribution and reduced stress.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Removing node_5 eliminates highly stressed member_6. Adding node_6 higher creates a stiffer top chord and better load path for the downward load at node_3. The triangular shape formed by node_1-node_4-node_6-node_2 provides multiple load paths. Using area sizes strategically reduces mass and stress. Shorter members and more direct load path reduce stress peaks. This approach balances mass and stress constraints.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Members: member_1: node_1-node_3 (area 3), member_2: node_3-node_2 (area 3), member_3: node_1-node_4 (area 2), member_4: node_4-node_2 (area 2), member_5: node_3-node_6 (area 2), member_6: node_4-node_6 (area 2), member_7: node_6-node_2 (area 1).
