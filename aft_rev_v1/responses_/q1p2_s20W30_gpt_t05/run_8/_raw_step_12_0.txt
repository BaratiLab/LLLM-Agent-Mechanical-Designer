Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass 30 units. Current iteration 11 fails stress and mass limits.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current structure has max stress 26.85 > 20 and mass 45.64 > 30. High stresses in member_5 (-26.85) and member_6 (-15.79). Mass dominated by large areas 3 and long members (member_3, member_4, member_8). Load path from node_3 to supports inefficient, causing overstress and excess mass. Node_8 high and far right adds mass but little stress relief. Members with area 3 are heavy.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Need to reduce mass by lowering areas or member lengths, reduce max stress by improving load paths. Possibly remove node_8 to reduce mass and complexity. Add intermediate nodes between node_3 and supports to better distribute load. Use smaller areas (1 or 2) for less stressed members. Keep load/support nodes fixed.",\n\n  "proposal": "Remove node_8. Add one new node (node_7) near center top to create a triangular truss. Connect node_3 to node_7, node_7 to node_4, node_7 to node_2 to form a stable triangular load path. Use area 2 for main load members, area 1 or 0 for secondary. Keep members from node_1 to node_3 and node_3 to node_2 with moderate areas (2 or 3). This reduces mass and improves force distribution.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Triangular truss topology is stable and efficient for 2D loads. Removing node_8 reduces mass and complexity. Adding node_7 near center top creates shorter members and better load transfer. Smaller areas reduce mass but must be balanced against stress. Using area 2 for main members balances strength and mass. Load at node_3 at -45deg requires diagonal members to transfer load efficiently to supports.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and estimate mass = sum(length * area). Check max stress by limiting area to keep stress within ±20. Areas: 0=1,1=0.195,2=0.782,3=1.759. Target total mass <30. Assign areas: main load members area 2, secondary area 1 or 0. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_7, node_7-node_4, node_7-node_2. Node positions: node_7 at approx (3.5, 3.5).",\n\n  "calculation": "Lengths (approx): node_1-node_3: 2.0; node_3-node_2: 4.0; node_1-node_4: ~4.6; node_4-node_2: ~2.7; node_3-node_7: ~4.3; node_7-node_4: ~1.4; node_7-node_2: ~3.0. Mass estimate: (2*0.782)+(4*0.782)+(4.6*0.195)+(2.7*0.195)+(4.3*0.782)+(1.4*0.195)+(3*0.782) = 1.56+3.13+0.9+0.53+3.36+0.27+2.35=12.1 approx, well under 30.
