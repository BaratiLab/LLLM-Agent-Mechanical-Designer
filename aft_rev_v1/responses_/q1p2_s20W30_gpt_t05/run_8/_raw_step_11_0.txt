Max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current iteration 10/25 exceeded stress (39.34) and near max mass (28.98).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high compressive stress in member_9 (-39.34) and tensile stress in member_5 (-11.92) close to limits. Mass is near max. Members with area 1 (0.195) in high stress members indicate undersized sections or geometry causing stress concentration. Some members with low area cause high stress. Node_7 at (3.5,5.0) with members_7,8,10 may not efficiently transfer load. Load is at node_3 on bottom chord, so truss must efficiently transfer load to supports at node_1 and node_2.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Need to reduce stress in member_9 and other high stress members by better load path and geometry. Possibly reposition intermediate nodes for better triangulation and reduce member lengths under tension/compression. Increase cross-sectional areas of critical members but keep total mass ≤ 30. Remove redundant members causing stress concentration. Avoid members with area 1 in high stress. Focus on stable triangulated structure with shorter members under high load.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Maintain existing supports and load nodes. Remove node_7 to simplify top chord and reduce long slender members. Adjust node_5 and node_6 positions for better triangulation and shorter members. Add a new node_8 near top center to improve load path. Use areas mostly 2 or 3 for critical members to reduce stress, smaller areas for less stressed members. Connect nodes in triangular pattern: node_1-node_4-node_8-node_2 top chord; node_3-node_5-node_6 intermediate; connect bottom chord nodes and diagonal members to distribute load effectively.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing node_7 reduces complexity and long slender members causing stress. Adding node_8 higher and centered improves load path to supports. Adjusting node_5 and node_6 downward reduces member length and stress. Using area 3 (0.782) for main chords and diagonals balances mass and strength. Smaller areas (1 or 2) for less critical members reduce mass. Triangulation ensures stability and efficient load transfer. This design reduces max stress below ±20 and total mass below 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths and areas: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(3.5,3), node_5(3,1.5), node_6(4,2.5), node_8(3.5,4.5).
