Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current iteration 14 has NaN stresses, mass 28.35, indicating instability or modeling error. Need stable, statically determinate or well-braced design with proper member areas.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(3.5,4), node_7(3.5,4). Members connect load and support nodes with some redundancy and zero area member (member_6 area 5 but zero mass). NaN stresses likely from zero or improper cross-sectional area or unstable member. Member areas too large in some members causing mass close to limit. Design lacks proper triangulation and balanced area distribution to reduce stress and mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove duplicate node_7 coinciding with node_4 at (3.5,4). Add a node above load node_3 to form stable triangle. Use smaller areas for less stressed members and larger for critical load paths. Avoid zero area members. Ensure no zero length or overlapping members. Use areas mostly 1-3 range to control mass. Keep total mass under 30. Use simple triangular truss geometry for stable load transfer.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_7. Add node_5 at (2.0, 3.0) above node_3 to form triangle with node_4 at (3.5,4). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_4, node_5-node_2. Assign areas: 2 for base chords, 1 for diagonal braces, 3 for critical members carrying load. This forms a stable triangular truss with proper load paths and controlled mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular truss geometry ensures stability and proper force distribution. Node_5 above node_3 creates a vertical load path reducing bending. Areas chosen to keep stresses within ±20 and mass under 30. Avoid zero or excessive area to prevent NaN or overmass. Members connecting load and supports sized for load transfer. No overlapping nodes or members. Supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. Load at node_3 handled by vertical and diagonal members.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approx: node_1-node_3=2, node_3-node_2=4, node_1-node_4=5, node_4-node_2=3, node_3-node_5=3, node_5-node_4=1.8, node_5-node_2=4.5. Area ids: \'1\'=0.195, \'2\'=0.782, \'3\'=1.759. Mass approx sum(length*area): (2*0.782)+(4*0.782)+(5*0.195)+(3*0.195)+(3*0.195)+(1.8*0.195)+(4.5*0.195)=1.56+3.13+0.98+0.59+0.59+0.35+0.88=7.62 << 30 limit.
