Load at node_3, supports fixed. Areas mostly 2 or 3. Member_6 has highest compressive stress (-11.76). Node_5 moved from y=4.0 to 3.5 reduced stress from 12.05 to 11.76. Aim to further reduce stress by adjusting node_5 vertically.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_6 shows highest compressive stress. Node_5 vertical position affects length and angle of members 5 and 6, influencing force distribution. Lowering node_5 slightly may reduce compressive stress in member_6 and balance tension in member_3 and 4. Must keep node_5 above node_3 (y=0) and within truss shape to maintain closed geometry.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Current node_5 at (2.0, 3.5). Try lowering to ~3.2-3.3 to reduce compressive stress in member_6. Check if mass remains under 30 with same areas. Consider keeping areas as is (2 or 3) since mass is well below limit.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Reducing height of node_5 reduces length of member_6, thus reducing compressive force. Also reduces bending moment on node_4 and redistributes load. Member_5 has zero stress, so slight length change won\'t increase stress there significantly. Maintaining areas at 2 or 3 keeps mass low and sufficient strength. No need to add nodes or change load/support nodes.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: member_6 length = distance(node_5, node_4). Current length ~ sqrt((3.5-2)^2 + (3.0-3.5)^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 0.25) = sqrt(2.5)=1.58. Lower node_5 to y=3.2: new length = sqrt(1.5^2 + (3.0-3.2)^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 0.04) = sqrt(2.29)=1.51 (shorter).

Member_6 length ~ sqrt(1.5^2 + 0.25^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 0.0625) = sqrt(2.3125) = 1.52. Mass of member_6 = length * area (3) = 1.52 * 1.759 = 2.67 (slightly less than 2.78). Member_5 length ~ sqrt((2-2)^2 + (3.25-0)^2) = 3.25, mass = 3.25 * 0.782 = 2.54 (slightly less than 2.73).
