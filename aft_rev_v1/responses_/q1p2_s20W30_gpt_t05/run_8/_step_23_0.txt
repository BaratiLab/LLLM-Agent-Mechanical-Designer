  "preamble": "Optimizing 2D truss under load at node_3 with pinned and roller supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: keep max stress within ±20 and total mass ≤ 30. Current design mass=34.77, max stress=20.84 (slightly over stress limit). Load at node_3 (-10, -45°). Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller).",
  
  "analysis": "Current structure has slightly excessive mass and max compressive stress (member_8 at -20.84) slightly exceeding limit. Members with large areas (3 or more) contribute to high mass. Members near node_4 and node_6 are highly stressed. The truss is somewhat dense with 7 nodes including 3 interior nodes. Load at node_3 induces compression in member_8 and tension in others. The structure can be optimized by reducing member areas and redistributing forces via better geometry.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing mass by lowering member areas especially for longer members, and slightly repositioning nodes 5, 6, 7 to improve force paths and reduce peak stress. Avoid removing load/support nodes. Remove member_12 to reduce complexity and mass. Add a new intermediate node near node_5 and node_6 to create a stiffer triangular substructure. Use smaller areas for low stress members and increase areas only where needed.",
  
  "proposal": "Modify current node positions for nodes 5, 6, 7 to optimize force flow. Remove member_12 (node_3-node_7). Add a new node_8 at (3.3, 3.7). Connect node_8 with node_5, node_6, node_7 with small area members. Adjust member areas to mostly 1 or 2, increase only critical members to 3. This reduces mass and stress.",
  
  "reasoning": "Reducing member areas lowers mass. Adding node_8 creates stiffer triangular substructures which reduce stress concentration. Removing member_12 reduces mass and complexity. Adjusting node_5,6,7 positions improves force distribution. Using mostly area_id 1 or 2 keeps mass low. Critical load paths use area 3 for safety. This balances mass and stress constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths and areas: areas mostly 1 or 2 (0.195 or 0.782). Member lengths ~1-3 m. Mass = sum(length * area). Target total mass < 30. Max stress ≤ ±20. Node_8 placed near center of triangle formed by nodes 5,6,7 for force redistribution.",
  
  "calculation": "Estimate member lengths and mass: (approximate) \n- member_1 (node_1-node_3): length=2.0, area=3 (0.782), mass=1.564\n- member_2 (node_3-node_2): length=4.0, area=2 (0.782), mass=3.128\n- member_3 (node_1-node_4): length=5.315, area=2, mass=4.156\n- member_4 (node_4-node_2): length=3.2, area=2, mass=2.56\n- member_5 (node_3-node_5): length=1.44, area=2, mass=1.44*0.782=1.126\n- member_6 (node_5-node_4): length=1.3, area=1, mass=0.254\n- member_7 (node_5-node_6): length=0.9, area=1, mass=0.176\n- member_8 (node_6-node_4): length=1.0, area=1, mass=0.195\n- member_9 (node_6-node_7): length=0.7, area=1, mass=0.137\n- member_10 (node_7-node_2): length=2.0, area=2, mass=1.564\n- member_11 (node_5-node_2): length=3.0, area=1, mass=0.585\n- member_13 (node_8-node_5): length=0.7, area=1, mass=0.137\n- member_14 (node_8-node_6): length=0.7, area=1, mass=0.137\n- member_15 (node_8-node_7): length=0.9, area=1, mass=0.176\nTotal mass approx = 17.3 < 30, stress expected reduced by better geometry and force paths.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All members area ≤ 3, mostly 1 or 2. Mass well below 30. Max stress expected ≤ 20 by avoiding long high area members and adding node_8. Removed member_12 to reduce stress concentration. Node positions adjusted for better force distribution. Supports and load nodes unchanged.",
