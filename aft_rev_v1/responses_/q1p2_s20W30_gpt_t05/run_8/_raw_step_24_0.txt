Load at node_3 (-10 N, -45Â°). Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Current design overshoots stress and marginally under mass limit. Need to reduce stress in high-stress members, especially member_11 (31.54) and member_6 (-27.18), and member_5 (-9.07).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has 8 nodes with members mostly low area (1 or 2). High stress in members with area 1, indicating undersized members. Member_11 (node_5-node_2) has tensile stress 31.54 > 20 limit. Member_6 (node_5-node_4) compressive stress -27.18 > -20 limit. Mass is 22.75 < 30, so room to increase member areas selectively. Load at node_3 causes bending and tension/compression in members connected to node_5 and node_4. Node_8 adds complexity but low mass members. Structure topology is complex, some members carry excessive stress due to low area and node placement. Node positions mostly fixed except added nodes; load/support nodes fixed.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress, increase area of critical members (member_11, member_6, member_5). Possibly remove node_8 to simplify structure and reduce stress concentration. Reposition node_7 slightly closer to node_2 to reduce member length and stress. Keep triangular bracing around node_4, node_5, node_6 for stiffness. Use area 3 or 4 for critical members, smaller areas for others to keep mass < 30.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_8 and its members to reduce complexity and stress concentration. Increase area of members with high stress: member_6 (node_5-node_4) area 4, member_11 (node_5-node_2) area 4, member_5 (node_3-node_5) area 3. Adjust node_7 position slightly to (4.0, 3.5) to shorten member_10 (node_7-node_2). Maintain remaining nodes positions. Keep members between node_5, node_6, node_4 for triangulation with small areas (1 or 2). Use member_1 area 3, member_2 area 2, member_3 area 2, member_4 area 2 for baseline stiffness. Resulting design reduces max stress below 20 and mass under 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing node_8 reduces low area members causing stress concentration. Increasing areas of critical members reduces stress by increasing cross-sectional capacity. Slight reposition of node_7 shortens long members to reduce stress. Triangular bracing ensures stability and load transfer. Areas chosen to balance mass and strength. Node_5 position kept to maintain load path. Supports unchanged as per instructions.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths and areas: member_11 length ~distance(node_5,node_2)= sqrt((6-2.3)^2+(0-3.5)^2)=4.4, area 4 (3.128) mass ~13.8. member_6 length ~distance(node_5,node_4)= sqrt((3.5-2.3)^2+(4-3.5)^2)=1.3, area 4 mass ~4.1. member_5 length ~distance(node_3,node_5)= sqrt((2-2.3)^2+(0-3.5)^2)=3.5, area 3 mass ~6.2.

Stress reduction proportional to area increase. Increasing area from 1 to 4 reduces stress by factor ~4. Member_11 stress 31.54/4=7.9 <20 OK. Member_6 stress -27.18/4= -6.8 <20 OK. Member_5 stress -9.07/3= -3.0 <20 OK. Other members have low stress and small areas. Total mass <30.
