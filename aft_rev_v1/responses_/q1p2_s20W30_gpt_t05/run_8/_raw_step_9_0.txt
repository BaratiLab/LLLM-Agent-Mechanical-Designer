Current iteration 8 exceeds stress and mass limits. Load at node_3 (-10 N, -45 deg). Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Nodes fixed: node_1, node_2, node_3. Members have high stress in members connected to node_5 and node_6. Mass too high at 31.85 > 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High compressive stress on member_6 (node_5-node_6) and member_8 (node_5-node_2) causing failure. Mass is high due to large area (4) on members 1 and 2. Node_5 position likely causes stress concentration. Current topology with node_5 and node_6 creates long slender members with high stress. Need to reduce member areas, reposition node_5, and add bracing to distribute load better.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce member areas on highly stressed members, reposition node_5 closer to node_4 and node_3 to reduce member lengths and stresses. Add diagonal bracing between node_4, node_5, and node_6 to improve stiffness. Use smaller areas for long members. Avoid member area 4 to reduce mass. Keep node_3 at x=2.0, y=0.0 fixed. Node_5 moved to reduce bending. Node_6 fixed at (3.0,4.0).",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep nodes 1,2,3 fixed. Move node_5 to (3.4,1.8) to reduce length of members connected to node_5. Add member between node_4 and node_6 for bracing. Use area 2 or less for most members, area 3 for main tension members. Remove member_8 (node_5-node_2) to reduce mass and stress. Members: node_1-node_3 (area 3), node_3-node_2 (area 3), node_1-node_4 (area 2), node_4-node_2 (area 2), node_3-node_5 (area 2), node_5-node_6 (area 1), node_6-node_2 (area 2), node_5-node_4 (area 1), node_4-node_6 (area 1).",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Reducing area on highly stressed members lowers stress. Moving node_5 closer to node_4 and node_3 reduces member length and stress. Adding diagonal bracing (node_4-node_6) improves load path and stiffness.
