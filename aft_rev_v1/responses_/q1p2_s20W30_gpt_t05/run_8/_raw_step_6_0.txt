Current max stress 162 exceeds ±20 limit, mass 7.74 under 30. Need to reduce stress by redesigning topology and member areas.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has high tensile/compressive stresses on members 4, 6, 10 exceeding ±20. Mass is low but stress failure dominates. Members near node_4, node_6, and node_5 are overstressed. Load at node_3 induces large bending and shear in the upper members. Existing nodes 1, 2, 3 fixed; nodes 4, 5, 6 can be repositioned or removed. Member areas mostly small (1 or 2).",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress concentration near node_4 and node_6 suggests insufficient triangulation or weak members. Adding a node higher above node_3 or between node_4 and node_6 could distribute forces better. Increase area of critical members. Remove or relocate node_5 to reduce complexity and stress concentration.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_5 to simplify structure. Adjust node_4 and node_6 positions for better load path. Add a new node_7 above node_4 and node_6 to form a stiffer upper triangle. Connect node_3 to node_7 and node_7 to node_2. Use larger areas for members under high stress, smaller for others. Resulting truss: nodes 1,2,3 fixed; node_4 at (3.5,3.5), node_6 at (3.0,4.0), node_7 at (3.5,5.0). Members: 1-3, 3-2, 1-4, 4-6, 6-7, 7-2, 3-6, 3-7, 4-7. Assign area ids to keep stress ≤20 and mass ≤30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangulated top chord with node_7 reduces bending in members 4 and 6. Increasing areas on members 4, 6, 7 improves stress capacity. Removing node_5 reduces load path complexity and stress concentration. Members 3-7 and 3-6 provide direct load transfer from node_3 to upper nodes. Member 7-2 transfers load to support. Member 1-4 and 4-6 stabilize left side.
