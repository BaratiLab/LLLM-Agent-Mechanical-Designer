  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to meet stress and mass constraints under given loads and supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress limit ±20, total mass ≤30. Current max stress 189.29 (exceeds), mass 17.82 (ok). Load at node_3 downward-left. Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Existing nodes and members show high stress in members connected to node_7 and node_6.",
  
  "analysis": "High stress in members 5 and 8 (135 and -189) indicates overloaded diagonals involving node_7 and node_6. Member areas mostly small (1 or 2). Node_7 at (3.5,5) is high, causing long members with high stress. Current topology has redundant members causing stress concentrations. Need to reduce length and redistribute load paths. Mass is low, so can increase areas strategically. Node_3 at (2,0) loaded; better triangulation near node_3 and supports needed. Node_4 and node_6 positions can be adjusted to improve load paths.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_7 to reduce long high-stress members. Add node closer to load and supports for better triangulation. Use larger areas for main load-carrying members, smaller for others. Keep load/support nodes fixed. Aim for simple triangulated topology with shorter members and balanced stress.",

  "proposal": "Remove node_7. Adjust node_4 to (3.5,3.0), keep node_6 at (3.0,4.0). Add node_5 at (3.0,2.0) to improve load transfer. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_5, node_5-node_6, node_6-node_2, node_4-node_6, node_5-node_4. Assign areas from 2 to 4 range to control stress and mass.",

  "reasoning": "Removing node_7 removes long high-stress members. Adding node_5 at mid-height improves triangulation near load and reduces stress. Members form multiple triangles distributing forces evenly. Larger areas on members under compression/tension near supports and load. Smaller areas on diagonals to reduce mass. This topology reduces max member length, improving stress distribution and keeping mass under 30.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and assign areas: Use area 4 (3.128) for main vertical and horizontal members, area 2 (0.782) for diagonals. Estimate mass = sum(length * area). Check stress expected to reduce with better triangulation and shorter members. Verify no member area zero. No duplicate members/nodes. Node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_3 fixed. Node_4 and node_6 adjusted. Node_5 new.",

  "calculation": "Member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_2 = 4.0, node_1-node_4 ~4.609, node_4-node_2 ~3.201, node_3-node_5 = 2.0, node_5-node_6 = 2.0, node_6-node_2 = 3.162, node_4-node_6 = 1.414, node_5-node_4 = 1.414. Mass estimate: sum(length*area). For example, node_1-node_3 area 4: 2*3.128=6.256, node_3-node_2 area 4: 4*3.128=12.512, node_1-node_4 area 2: 4.609*0.782=3.604, node_4-node_2 area 2: 3.201*0.782=2.505, node_3-node_5 area 3: 2*1.759=3.518, node_5-node_6 area 2: 2*0.782=1.564, node_6-node_2 area 2: 3.162*0.782=2.473, node_4-node_6 area 1: 1.414*0.195=0.276, node_5-node_4 area 1: 1.414*0.195=0.276. Total ~32.5 slightly above 30, reduce some areas to 1 or 0.782 to reduce mass. Adjust node_3-node_2 area to 3 (1.759): 4*1.759=7.036 to save mass. Recalculate total mass ~27.0 <30. Stress expected below ±20 due to good triangulation and area sizing.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Final nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (3.5,3.0), node_5 (3.0,2.0), node_6 (3.0,4.0). Members and areas assigned to balance stress and mass. No duplicate nodes or members. Load and supports fixed. Mass under 30, max stress expected under 20.",
