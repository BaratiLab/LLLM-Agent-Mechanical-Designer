Current max stress 241.3 > 20, mass 23.8 < 30. Need stress reduction mainly in members 8 and 9.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High compressive stress in members connecting nodes 4, 5, 6 (members 8 and 9). Current topology has a triangle at top right causing stress concentration. Member 6 (5-6) is tensile but large stress. Areas mostly small (1 or 2). Load applied at node_3 near bottom center, causing bending. Increase triangulation and redistribute forces by adding a node higher and repositioning nodes 5 and 6 for better force paths. Use larger areas for critical members to reduce stress. Avoid increasing mass beyond 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove member 9 (4-6) or reduce its area, reposition node_5 higher and more centered, add node_7 above node_6 to form stable upper triangle. Use area 3 or 4 for main chords, area 1 or 2 for diagonals. Increase height of truss to reduce bending moment. Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Add node_7 at (3.5, 5.0).",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_7 at (3.5, 5.0). Modify node_5 to (3.2, 2.5) and node_6 to (3.0, 4.0). Remove member_9. Members: main bottom chords (1-3, 3-2) area 3, verticals and diagonals area 2 or 3, top triangle members area 1 or 2. Connect node_5 to node_4 and node_7, node_6 to node_7 and node_2, node_3 to node_5 and node_6. This improves load path and reduces stress concentration.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing truss height reduces bending moments and distributes load better. Adding node_7 creates upper triangle enhancing stiffness. Removing member_9 reduces compressive stress concentration. Increasing area of main chords reduces stress. Using smaller areas for secondary members controls mass. Repositioning node_5 upward shifts load path to reduce stress in member_8 and 9. Overall mass remains below 30 due to controlled area selection.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths, assign areas, estimate stresses proportional to force paths. Ensure max stress ≤ 20.
