  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to reduce max stress and keep mass under 30, keeping fixed load/support nodes.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 12.05 < 20, mass 27.42 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. Node_5 added to reduce stress from iteration 0. Areas mostly 2 or 3. Member_6 stress highest at 12.05.",
  "analysis": "Member_6 (node_5-node_4) has max stress 12.05, close to limit. Members with zero or low stress (member_5) can be adjusted. Node_5 at (2,4) is free to move. To reduce stress in member_6, consider shortening it or adjusting node_5 position. Members connected to node_3 have compressive stresses -6.34 and -2.32. Load direction is -45 degrees at node_3, inducing tension/compression in members. Current topology is closed with 6 members. Areas are moderate (2 or 3). Mass close to limit but room to increase area if needed. Strategy: move node_5 to reduce length and stress in member_6, adjust member areas if needed, possibly reduce area in low stress members to save mass.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Shorten member_6 by moving node_5 closer to node_4 along vertical or horizontal direction. Node_5 y=4 can be reduced slightly for shorter member_6. Check effect on member_5 (node_3-node_5) stress which is zero now. Possibly reduce area of member_5 from 3 to 2 or 1 to save mass. Increase area of member_6 if stress still high after shortening. Keep node_3 fixed at (2,0).",
  "reasoning": "Reducing length of member_6 reduces stress for same force. Moving node_5 closer to node_4 reduces member_6 length. Member_5 currently zero stress, area can be reduced to save mass for increasing member_6 area if needed. Keep node_4 position to maintain geometry and support load transfer. Node_3 fixed due to load. Areas chosen from given set. Mass limit 30 allows some margin for area adjustments.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: member_6 length currently ~distance between (2,4) and (3.5,3) = sqrt(1.5^2 + 1^2) = ~1.8. Moving node_5 down to y=3.5 reduces length to sqrt(1.5^2 + 0.5^2) = ~1.58, ~12% reduction. Stress ~ force / area / length, so stress reduces roughly proportionally. Member_5 length from (2,0) to (2,4) = 4. Reducing area from 3 to 2 saves mass. Member areas: member_6 currently 3, possibly increase to 4 if needed. Total mass recalculated after changes.",
  "calculation": "Move node_5 from (2,4) to (2,3.5). Change member_5 area from '3' to '2'. Keep member_6 area at '3' initially. Recalculate member lengths and approximate mass: member_5 length 3.5, area factor 0.782, mass ~2.74 (was 7.036). Member_6 length 1.58, area factor 1.759, mass ~2.78 (was 3.1711). Total mass reduced by ~4.7 units, new total mass ~22.7, well below 30. Expect stress in member_6 reduced by ~12%. Max stress likely ~10.6 < 12.05. Other members unchanged. This should reduce max stress and mass, improving design.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New node_5 position (2.0, 3.5). member_5 area '2', member_6 area '3'. Other members unchanged. Check no duplicate nodes or members. Load/support nodes unchanged. Design remains closed truss. Constraints satisfied with margin. Stop=False to continue optimization if needed.",
