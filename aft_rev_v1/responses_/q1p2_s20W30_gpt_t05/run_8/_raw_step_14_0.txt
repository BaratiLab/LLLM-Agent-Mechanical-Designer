Supports at node_1 pinned and node_2 roller. Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current max stress 51.94 > 20, mass 16.7 < 30. Need to reduce stress by better load path and member sizing.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has high stress in member_6 (node_7-node_4) at 51.94, and elevated stresses in members around node_4 and node_7. Members with area \'1\' (0.195) in these critical parts cause stress concentrations. The load path from node_3 to supports is via node_7 and node_4 with small area members. The structure is somewhat complex with nodes 4,7,8. The load is downward-left at node_3, so truss should efficiently transfer load to supports at node_1 and node_2 on base line. Current design\'s tall node positions (node_4 at y=4.2, node_7 at 4.8) cause long slender members with high stress. Mass is well below max, so can increase cross-section in key members. Also, some members (node_4-node_8 and node_8-node_2) add complexity and mass with moderate stress. Simplifying geometry and increasing areas in high stress members can reduce max stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing stress in members around node_4 and node_7 by increasing areas, reducing height of node_7 to reduce length and improve force distribution. Possibly remove node_8 to simplify. Keep load and support nodes fixed. Use areas up to 4.887 or 7.037 in critical members. Maintain triangulation for stability. Check member lengths and stresses after adjustments.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Maintain nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0), node_4 (3.5,4.0), node_7 (3.5,4.0). Remove node_8 to simplify. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_7, node_7-node_4, node_7-node_2. Increase areas for members with previously high stress: members connecting node_4 and node_7 to area \'4\' (3.128) or \'5\' (4.887), others moderate areas \'2\' (0.782) or \'3\' (1.759). This should reduce stresses below ±20 and keep mass below 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Load at node_3 is downward-left, so direct load path to supports at node_1 and node_2 is critical. The triangle formed by node_1-node_4-node_2 supports vertical load well. Node_7 close to node_4 at y=4.0 reduces member length and stress. Removing node_8 avoids unnecessary members and mass. Increasing cross-section in high stress members reduces stress. Using area \'4\' or \'5\' in critical members balances mass and strength. Members between node_3 and node_7 and node_7 to supports help distribute load and reduce stress concentration at node_4.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approx: node_1-node_3=2m, node_3-node_2=4m, node_1-node_4=~5.315m, node_4-node_2=~2.7m, node_3-node_7=~4.12m, node_7-node_4=0m (same y, x diff 0), node_7-node_2=~2.7m.

Estimated mass sum(length*area) < 30. Stress reduced by larger areas in node_4-node_7 and node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2 members.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Mass approx: member_1(2m*0.782)=1.56, member_2(4m*0.782)=3.13, member_3(5.315m*3.128)=16.63, member_4(2.7m*3.128)=8.45, member_5(4.12m*1.759)=7.24, member_6(0m*4.887)=0, member_7(2.7m*1.759)=4.75. Total ~41.7 is above 30, so reduce some areas: use area \'2\'(0.782) for node_1-node_4 and node_4-node_2 instead of \'4\'(3.128), mass then: member_3=5.315*0.782=4.15, member_4=2.7*0.782=2.11. Total mass now ~1.56+3.13+4.15+2.11+7.24+0+4.75=22.94 <30. Stress likely under 20 with these areas and shorter node_7 height. Node_7 and node_4 at same height reduces bending moments and stress peaks.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_final": "Final design keeps critical nodes fixed, removes node_8, reduces height of node_7 to 4.0 (same as node_4).
