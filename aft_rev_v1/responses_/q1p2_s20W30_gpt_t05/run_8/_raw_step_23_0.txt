Current design mass=34.77, max stress=20.84 (slightly over stress limit). Load at node_3 (-10, -45°). Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has slightly excessive mass and max compressive stress (member_8 at -20.84) slightly exceeding limit. Members with large areas (3 or more) contribute to high mass. Members near node_4 and node_6 are highly stressed. The truss is somewhat dense with 7 nodes including 3 interior nodes. Load at node_3 induces compression in member_8 and tension in others. The structure can be optimized by reducing member areas and redistributing forces via better geometry.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing mass by lowering member areas especially for longer members, and slightly repositioning nodes 5, 6, 7 to improve force paths and reduce peak stress. Avoid removing load/support nodes. Remove member_12 to reduce complexity and mass. Add a new intermediate node near node_5 and node_6 to create a stiffer triangular substructure. Use smaller areas for low stress members and increase areas only where needed.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Modify current node positions for nodes 5, 6, 7 to optimize force flow. Remove member_12 (node_3-node_7). Add a new node_8 at (3.3, 3.7). Connect node_8 with node_5, node_6, node_7 with small area members. Adjust member areas to mostly 1 or 2, increase only critical members to 3. This reduces mass and stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Reducing member areas lowers mass. Adding node_8 creates stiffer triangular substructures which reduce stress concentration. Removing member_12 reduces mass and complexity. Adjusting node_5,6,7 positions improves force distribution. Using mostly area_id 1 or 2 keeps mass low. Critical load paths use area 3 for safety. This balances mass and stress constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths and areas: areas mostly 1 or 2 (0.195 or 0.782). Member lengths ~1-3 m. Mass = sum(length * area).
