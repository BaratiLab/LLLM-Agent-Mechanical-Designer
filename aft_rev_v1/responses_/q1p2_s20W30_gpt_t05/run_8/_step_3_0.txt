  "preamble": "Optimize node 5 position to reduce max stress while respecting constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress = 11.76 < 20, total mass = 22.73 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Areas mostly 2 or 3. Member_6 has highest compressive stress (-11.76). Node_5 moved from y=4.0 to 3.5 reduced stress from 12.05 to 11.76. Aim to further reduce stress by adjusting node_5 vertically.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_6 shows highest compressive stress. Node_5 vertical position affects length and angle of members 5 and 6, influencing force distribution. Lowering node_5 slightly may reduce compressive stress in member_6 and balance tension in member_3 and 4. Must keep node_5 above node_3 (y=0) and within truss shape to maintain closed geometry.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Current node_5 at (2.0, 3.5). Try lowering to ~3.2-3.3 to reduce compressive stress in member_6. Check if mass remains under 30 with same areas. Consider keeping areas as is (2 or 3) since mass is well below limit.",
  
  "reasoning": "Reducing height of node_5 reduces length of member_6, thus reducing compressive force. Also reduces bending moment on node_4 and redistributes load. Member_5 has zero stress, so slight length change won't increase stress there significantly. Maintaining areas at 2 or 3 keeps mass low and sufficient strength. No need to add nodes or change load/support nodes.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: member_6 length = distance(node_5, node_4). Current length ~ sqrt((3.5-2)^2 + (3.0-3.5)^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 0.25) = sqrt(2.5)=1.58. Lower node_5 to y=3.2: new length = sqrt(1.5^2 + (3.0-3.2)^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 0.04) = sqrt(2.29)=1.51 (shorter). Mass proportional to length * area, so mass slightly less or equal. Stress expected to reduce.",
  
  "calculation": "Set node_5 at (2.0, 3.25). Member_6 length ~ sqrt(1.5^2 + 0.25^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 0.0625) = sqrt(2.3125) = 1.52. Mass of member_6 = length * area (3) = 1.52 * 1.759 = 2.67 (slightly less than 2.78). Member_5 length ~ sqrt((2-2)^2 + (3.25-0)^2) = 3.25, mass = 3.25 * 0.782 = 2.54 (slightly less than 2.73). Total mass decreases slightly, max stress estimated to reduce from -11.76 to about -10.5 in member_6, improving margin.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "No changes to other nodes or members. Areas remain same. Mass stays below 30. Max stress reduces, improving structural safety. No violation of constraints. Next iteration can verify FEM results. Stop not recommended yet as stress can improve further with minor node_5 adjustments.",
