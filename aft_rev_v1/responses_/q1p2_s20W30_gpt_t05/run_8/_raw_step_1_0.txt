Member_5 has smallest area (1) but high stress. Members 1 and 2 have large areas (4) but low stress. Load at node_3 causes high stress in diagonal member_5 between node_3 and node_4. The truss is a simple quadrilateral with a diagonal. To reduce stress, redistribute forces by adding a new node above node_3 to create two diagonals, improving load path and reducing stress concentration. Also, reduce area of overdesigned members to save mass while increasing area of critical members moderately to reduce stress. Node_3 is on bottom chord between supports, likely a weak point under load.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_5 above node_3 at about (2.0, 4.0) to create two diagonals from node_3 to node_5 and node_5 to node_4. Remove member_5, replace with member_5 (node_3 to node_5) and member_6 (node_5 to node_4). Adjust areas: reduce member_1 and member_2 area from 4 to 3 to save mass, increase new diagonals to 2 or 3 to reduce stress. Check if total mass remains under 30 and stresses under 20.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 at (2.0, 4.0). Remove member_5. Add members: member_5 (node_3-node_5), member_6 (node_5-node_4).

Reducing large areas on members 1 and 2 saves mass. Increasing area on new diagonals spreads load. Member lengths moderate, so mass remains within limit.
