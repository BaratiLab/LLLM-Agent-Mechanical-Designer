  "preamble": "Optimize closed 2D truss with 3 given nodes, load at node_3, supports at node_1 and node_2, minimize stress within ±20 and mass ≤ 30.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Nodes fixed at node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Load -10 at 45° down-left on node_3. Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Need closed truss (all nodes connected forming at least one closed loop). Max stress ±20, max mass 30. Areas discrete from given set. Single iteration, no node repositioning allowed.",

  "analysis": "Given nodes are colinear along x-axis at y=0, so to form a closed truss, add a new node above the line to create a triangle. This will form a stable closed truss. Load acts on node_3, which is between node_1 and node_2. Supports at ends. Triangular configuration is simplest closed truss with 4 nodes. Select node_4 above x-axis near node_3 to reduce member lengths and stresses. Use equilibrium to size areas minimizing stress and mass. Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_4-node_3, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2. Closed polygon formed by nodes 1-4-2 and node_3 connected inside.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2.8, 2.0) approx to form triangle with node_1 and node_2. Connect members to form closed loops: (1-4), (4-2), (1-3), (3-2), (3-4). Calculate member lengths, select minimal areas to keep mass under 30. Check stress approx by static equilibrium assuming axial forces only. Use load vector components Fx= -10 cos45= -7.07, Fy= -7.07 at node_3.",

  "reasoning": "1) Add node_4 above line to create closed truss triangle with nodes 1 and 2. 2) Connect node_4 with node_3 to transfer load efficiently. 3) Use members along bottom line (1-3, 3-2) for stability. 4) Calculate member forces by method of joints assuming pin joints and axial forces only. 5) Use areas from given discrete set, select smallest area that keeps stress ≤ 20. 6) Total mass = sum(length × area). 7) Approximate stresses = axial force / area. 8) Adjust areas iteratively to meet constraints. 9) Keep node positions fixed except new node_4.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: L(1-3)=2, L(3-2)=4, L(1-4)=√((2.8-0)^2+(2-0)^2)=√(7.84+4)=√11.84=3.44, L(4-2)=√((6-2.8)^2+0-2^2)=√(10.24+4)=√14.24=3.77, L(3-4)=√((2.8-2)^2+(2-0)^2)=√(0.64+4)=√4.64=2.15. Total length=2+4+3.44+3.77+2.15=15.36. Choose areas to minimize mass and keep stress ≤ 20. Members near load need larger area. Approximate member forces using static equilibrium at node_3 and node_4.",

  "calculation": "Load at node_3: Fx=-7.07, Fy=-7.07. Assume members 1-3 and 3-2 carry horizontal components, members 3-4 carry vertical components. Using method of joints at node_3: sum Fx=0: F_1-3 + F_3-2 + F_3-4x = -7.07; sum Fy=0: F_3-4y = -7.07. Approximate axial forces: F_3-4 ~10 N (tension), F_1-3 and F_3-2 share horizontal load ~7 N. Assign areas: 1-3: 1.759 (area_id 3), 3-2: 1.759 (area_id 3), 3-4: 3.128 (area_id 4) to keep stress ≤ 20 (stress = force/area). For members 1-4 and 4-2 carry reaction forces, assign areas 1.759 (area_id 3) each. Mass = sum(length × area) = (2×1.759)+(4×1.759)+(3.44×1.759)+(3.77×1.759)+(2.15×3.128) = 3.518+7.036+6.05+6.63+6.73=29.96 ≤ 30 max. Stress approx max = 10/3.128=3.2 < 20, safe.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 added at (2.8, 2.0) to form closed triangular truss. Members connected to form closed loop and stabilize load. Areas chosen to keep stress ≤ 20 and mass ≤ 30. Approximate static equilibrium and axial stress calculations confirm constraints met. No duplicate nodes or members. Node positions fixed except added node_4. Areas from discrete set used.",
