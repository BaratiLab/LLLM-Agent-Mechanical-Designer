  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to reduce max stress, maintain constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 6.65 < 20, mass 24.43 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved to y=2.0 from 1.5 and 2.5 in prior steps. Added member_6 (node_1-node_2) reduces stress. Areas vary 2-3 mostly, one member area 2.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress 6.65 is moderate. Member_1 and member_3 have higher tensile stresses (~6.6 and 4.8). Compressive stresses moderate. Total mass 24.43 is well below 30, so room to increase member areas or reposition node_4 to reduce stress further. Node_3 and supports fixed, so only node_4 can move. Member_6 added in iteration 3 improved stress distribution. Member areas mostly medium (2 or 3).",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing node_4 height slightly might reduce bending stresses in members connected to node_4. Also, adjusting node_4 x-position slightly could balance forces better. Consider increasing area of critical members (member_1, member_3) if mass allows. Avoid increasing mass beyond 30. Stress in member_1 is highest compressive, member_3 highest tensile. Member_5 also compressive but less. Member_2 and member_4 low stress. Member_6 moderate compressive.",
  
  "reasoning": "To reduce max stress, optimize node_4 position to better align force paths. Increasing node_4 y slightly above 2.0 might reduce member_3 tensile stress and member_1 compressive stress. Slightly shifting node_4 x closer to node_3 (from 3.0 to ~2.7) can shorten member_1 and member_5, reducing stress. Increase area of member_1 and member_3 from 3 to 4 (area 3.128 to 3.128 or 4.887) if mass budget permits. Member_5 area can be kept at 3 to avoid mass increase. Member_2 and member_4 area 2 is sufficient. Member_6 area 2 is fine.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_4 from (3.0, 2.0) to (2.7, 2.2). Member_1 length reduces slightly, member_3 length increases slightly but better force alignment. Member areas: member_1:4, member_3:4, others same. Check mass: sum length * area. Lengths approx: m1 ~2.7, m3 ~2.7, m5 ~2.3, m6 ~6.0, m2 ~4.0, m4 ~3.6. Mass estimate: m1=2.7*3.128=8.45, m3=2.7*3.128=8.45, m5=2.3*1.759=4.05, m6=6*0.782=4.69, m2=4*0.782=3.13, m4=3.6*0.782=2.82. Total ~31.5 > 30, so reduce some areas. Keep member_1 area 3 (1.759), member_3 area 3, member_5 area 3, member_6 area 2, member_2 and member_4 area 2. Mass ~ 2.7*1.759 + 2.7*1.759 + 2.3*1.759 + 6*0.782 + 4*0.782 + 3.6*0.782 = 4.75 + 4.75 + 4.05 + 4.69 + 3.13 + 2.82 = 24.19 < 30. This mass is acceptable and stress should reduce due to better node_4 position.",
  
  "calculation": "Update node_4 to (2.7, 2.2). Member areas: member_1:3, member_2:2, member_3:3, member_4:2, member_5:3, member_6:2. Member connections unchanged. Expect stress reduction due to improved geometry and maintain mass < 30. Monitor max stress expected < 6.0 based on prior trends. This design balances stress and mass well.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no load/support node moved. No duplicate nodes or members. Areas from allowed set. Mass < 30. Max stress expected < 7. Current max stress 6.65, expect improvement. Stop=False to allow further refinement if needed.",
