Max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current design iteration 2 has max stress 43.58 (exceeds limit) and mass 12.24 (within limit). Need to reduce stress, especially member_5 (-43.58 stress), and maintain mass below 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has a low mass but an overstressed member_5 (node_3-node_4). Member areas are small (area_id 1 for member_5). The truss shape is a simple triangle with a low node_4. Increasing node_4 height or repositioning it can reduce stress in member_5 by better load transfer. Also, increasing some member areas or adding a diagonal member can improve load distribution. The previous iterations had node_4 higher (2.0-2.5) but mass was near or above 30. Aim to find a balance with node_4 around 2.0 height, adjust member areas, and add a diagonal member if needed.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress mainly in member_5 due to load direction. Member_5 length is short, so stress high with small area. Member_2 area was reduced from 3 to 2, member_5 from 4 to 1, causing stress spike. Increasing member_5 area to 3 or 4 helps. Possibly add member from node_1 to node_2 (bottom chord) to reduce bending and share load. Node positions fixed for supports and load. Node_4 can be moved vertically. Avoid heavy mass increase.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep nodes 1, 2, 3 fixed. Move node_4 to (3.0, 2.0) to raise height for better load path. Add member_6 connecting node_1 and node_2 with area_id 2 for bottom chord support. Increase member_5 area to 3 to reduce stress. Keep other members at area_id 3 or 2 as appropriate. This creates a more stable truss with two triangles and bottom chord, reducing stress on member_5 and distributing load better, keeping mass under 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Raising node_4 increases vertical component of members, reducing member_5 axial load. Adding bottom chord (node_1-node_2) shares horizontal forces, reducing bending and stress on members. Increasing member_5 area reduces stress by increasing cross-section. Using area_id 3 and 2 balances mass and strength. This structure resembles a classic Pratt or Warren truss segment, known for efficiency. Mass estimate remains under 30 given member lengths and areas.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_1-node_2 = 6.0, node_1-node_3 = 2.0, node_3-node_2 = 4.0, node_1-node_4 = sqrt(3^2 + 2^2) = 3.6056, node_4-node_2 = sqrt(3^2 + 0^2) = 3.0, node_3-node_4 = sqrt(1^2 + 2^2) = 2.236.
