  "preamble": "Optimized 2D truss with minimized stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress ~6 is well below ±20 limit; total mass ~24.4 < 30. Node_4 moved to reduce stress from previous iterations.",
  "analysis": "All constraints satisfied: max stress ±20, total mass < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Member areas and node positions optimized to balance stress and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further node_4 position changes cause marginal stress improvement but risk mass increase or stress concentration. Current design stable.",
  "reasoning": "Stress minimized by adjusting node_4 vertically and horizontally within small range to balance load paths. Area selections favor moderate sizes to keep mass low while controlling stress.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member areas: member_1=3 (1.759), member_2=2 (0.782), member_3=3 (1.759), member_4=2 (0.782), member_5=3 (1.759), member_6=2 (0.782). Node_4 at (2.65,2.15) balances tension/compression. Load and support nodes fixed.",
  "calculation": "No member stress exceeds ±6, well below ±20. Total mass 24.4043 < 30. Node_4 position optimized to minimize max stress. Member areas consistent with stress levels. No duplicate nodes or members. Closed truss maintained.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Design meets all constraints with margin. Further optimization unlikely to yield significant improvement without violating mass or stress limits. Stop optimization.",
