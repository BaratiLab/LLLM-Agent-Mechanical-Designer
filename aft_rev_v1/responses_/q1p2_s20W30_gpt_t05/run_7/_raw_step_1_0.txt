Load at node_3, supports at nodes_1 and 2 fixed. Node_4 movable. Area sizes mostly moderate. Objective: reduce max stress further by geometry adjustment.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max compressive stress at member_1 (-7.77) is highest magnitude. Members connected to node_4 have moderate stress. Node_4 controls load path between supports and load node_3. Moving node_4 up or slightly right may reduce stress in member_1 by redistributing forces. Member areas seem balanced; focus on geometry.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adjust node_4 from (2.8, 2.0) to (3.0, 2.5) to increase vertical height, improve truss stiffness, reduce tension/compression in member_1 and member_5.

Slight horizontal shift right allows better load transfer to node_2. Member lengths increase slightly but mass still under 30 with same area choices.
