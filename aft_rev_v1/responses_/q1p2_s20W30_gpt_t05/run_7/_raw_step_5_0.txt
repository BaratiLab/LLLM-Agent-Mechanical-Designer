Load at node_3, supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. Only node_4 movable.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_1 (-5.97), member_4 (5.43), and member_3 (4.24). Mass is moderate. Member areas mostly 2 or 3. Member_4 area is 2, member_3 and member_5 area 3, member_6 area 2. The triangular topology with members connecting node_4 to node_1 and node_2 and node_3 is good. Slightly reducing stress on highly stressed members while keeping mass under 30 is possible by repositioning node_4 to better balance force distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_4 moved from (3.0,2.0) to (2.7,2.2) improved stress from 6.65 to 5.97. Further small adjustment may reduce max stress further. Moving node_4 closer to node_3 horizontally may reduce tension in member_3 and compression in member_1. Increasing vertical height slightly may improve load path. Avoid moving node_4 too far to keep stable geometry and closed truss.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Reducing stress in member_1 (compression) and member_4 (tension) is priority. Member_3 tension can be slightly reduced by moving node_4 closer to node_3 horizontally (reduce length and force). Member_5 stress (-4.21 compression) is moderate. Member_6 (bottom chord) stress moderate (-3.0). Keeping node_4 within x=2.5 to 2.9 and y=2.0 to 2.3 range to balance forces. Areas can remain same since mass under limit and changing areas risks mass or stress increase.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and forces depend on node_4 position. Area ids kept as before to keep mass stable: member_1(3), member_2(2), member_3(3), member_4(2), member_5(3), member_6(2). Calculated length of member_1 with node_4 at (2.65,2.15) is sqrt((2.65-0)^2 + (2.15-0)^2)=~3.43. Member_3 length sqrt((2.65-0)^2 + (2.15-0)^2)= same. Member_4 length sqrt((6-2.65)^2 + (0-2.15)^2)=~3.76. Member_5 length sqrt((2.65-2)^2 + (2.15-0)^2)=~2.17.
