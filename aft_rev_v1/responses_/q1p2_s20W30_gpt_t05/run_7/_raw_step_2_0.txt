Constraints: max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current design mass 32.7 exceeds limit.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current truss has 4 nodes (including load/support nodes) and 5 members with areas mostly 3 and 4. Mass exceeds 30, though max stress is within limits. Member_5 (node_3-node_4) is heaviest. Node_4 raised to 2.5m increased mass. Need to reduce mass by either reducing member lengths or areas, or removing/repositioning nodes/members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing node_4 height or removing it may reduce mass. Consider simpler triangular truss connecting node_1, node_2, node_3 with optimized member areas. Possibly add a new node at lower height for better load path and reduced mass. Avoid increasing length unnecessarily.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_4 to simplify structure. Use triangular truss with nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0). Add a new node_4 at (3,1.5) to provide vertical support and reduce bending. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_4. Select smaller areas for longer members to reduce mass but keep stress within limits. Use area ids: 3 for shorter members, 2 or 1 for longer members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular truss with a vertical node reduces bending moments and distributes load efficiently. Keeping node_4 lower reduces member lengths and mass. Using smaller areas on longer members reduces mass while keeping stress acceptable. Node_3 is load point; member_3-node_4 helps transfer load to supports. Supports fixed, load fixed; optimize internal nodes and member areas.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: node_1-node_3 = 2m, node_3-node_2 = 4m, node_1-node_4 = sqrt(3^2 +1.5^2)=3.3541m, node_4-node_2 = sqrt(3^2 +1.5^2)=3.3541m, node_3-node_4 = sqrt(1^2 +1.5^2)=1.8028m. Assign areas: members connected to supports and load get area 3 (1.759), longer members 2 (0.782), shortest member 1 (0.195). Total mass approx sum(length*area).",\n  \n  "calculation": "Mass = 2*1.759 + 4*0.782 + 3.3541*0.782 + 3.3541*0.782 + 1.8028*0.195 = 3.518 + 3.128 + 2.624 + 2.624 + 0.351 = 12.245 kg approx, well below 30.
