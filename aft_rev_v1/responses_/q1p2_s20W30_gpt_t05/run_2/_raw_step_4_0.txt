Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_7 moved to (2,4) to reduce stress.",\n  "analysis": "Max stress is well below limit, mass is below max. Members with zero stress can be optimized for mass but are already minimal area. Current geometry balances load well.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_3 and member_4 have compressive stress ~ -3.5, member_2 tensile -2.5, member_1 zero stress. Areas are moderate (2 and 3).",\n  "reasoning": "Further stress reduction unlikely without increasing mass or changing load/support nodes. Moving node_7 higher or sideways risks increasing stress or instability. Areas are selected to keep stress low with moderate mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Current design uses node_7 at (2,4) creating a triangular truss. Members sized appropriately. Mass and stress within limits. No duplicate nodes or members. Load/support nodes fixed.",\n  "calculation": "No further mass reduction possible without increasing stress beyond constraints.
