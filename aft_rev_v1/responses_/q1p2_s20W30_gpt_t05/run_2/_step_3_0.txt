  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under given loads and supports with stress and mass constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 (-10N at -45°), supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Constraints: max ±20 stress, max total mass 30. Current design fails stress at member_4 (-64.47). Need to reduce stress in bottom chord and redistribute forces.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design has a bottom chord member_4 (node_1-node_3) highly overstressed in compression (-64.47). Other stresses are within limits. Total mass is low (10.45) so mass budget allows strengthening or adding members. The load direction induces bending and compression on bottom chord. Triangular truss with a top node (node_6) is good but member_4 too small area (area_id=1). Increasing area or adding diagonal members can help. Also, node_3 is on bottom chord between supports, which is unusual, causing high stress. Adding a vertical or diagonal member from node_3 to top node or supports can redistribute load. Consider moving the top node slightly upward and adding a vertical member from node_3 to top node to reduce bending moment on bottom chord. Keep supports and load nodes fixed. Use area sizes up to 10 for critical members.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Increase area of bottom chord members, add vertical member from node_3 to top node, adjust top node position to balance forces. Avoid excessive mass by using moderate area sizes. Check stress and mass after modification.",
  
  "proposal": "Add node_7 vertically above node_3 at (2.0, 4.0). Connect node_7 to node_1, node_2, and node_3. Increase area of bottom chord members to reduce stress. Use areas: bottom chord members area_id=4 (3.128), diagonals area_id=3 (1.759), vertical member area_id=3 (1.759). Remove member_4 (node_1-node_3) to eliminate high compression member.",
  
  "reasoning": "Removing bottom chord member_4 eliminates overstressed member. Adding node_7 above node_3 creates a vertical member that carries load directly, reducing bending in bottom chord. Diagonal members from node_7 to supports distribute load efficiently. Increasing area of bottom chord members reduces stress. Mass remains under 30 due to moderate area sizes and short members. This truss resembles a Warren or Pratt truss with verticals, known for efficient load distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: node_1-node_2 = 6.0m, node_1-node_7 ≈ sqrt(2^2 + 4^2) = 4.472m, node_2-node_7 ≈ sqrt(4^2 + 4^2) = 5.657m, node_3-node_7 = 4.0m. Areas chosen to balance stress and mass. Estimate mass: sum(length * area) with area factors. Stress expected reduced due to vertical load path.",
  
  "calculation": "Mass estimate: member_1 (node_1-node_6) replaced by (node_1-node_7) length 4.472m × 3.128 = 13.98, member_2 (node_7-node_2) length 5.657m × 3.128 = 17.69, member_3 (node_3-node_7) length 4.0m × 1.759 = 7.036, member_4 removed, member_5 (node_3-node_2) length 4.0m × 1.759 = 7.036. Total mass approx 45.74, which is above 30. Reduce areas on longer members to area_id=2 (0.782): mass becomes (4.472*0.782)+(5.657*0.782)+(4*1.759)+(4*1.759)=3.5+4.4+7.036+7.036=~22 mass, under limit. Bottom chord replaced by node_3-node_2 member with area 1.759 to carry load. Stress expected within limits due to vertical load path.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Final design removes overstressed member, adds vertical node and members, adjusts areas to keep mass under 30 and stresses under ±20. Load path improved to reduce bending and compression in bottom chord.",
