Current max stress 48.35 > 20, mass 19.77 < 30. Need stress reduction primarily.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design places node_5 at (2,4) with large cross-section members (area_id \'3\') causing high mass and stress. Members connected to node_5 have low stress but members from node_1 to node_3 and node_5 to node_3 are overstressed. The load is applied at node_3, which is on the bottom chord. The structure is asymmetric and likely inefficient in force distribution. A better truss would triangulate load path with smaller member areas and possibly reposition intermediate nodes to reduce member length and stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding a new intermediate node between node_3 and node_2 or node_1 and node_3 to reduce member length and distribute forces. Use smaller cross sections on high-stress members where possible. Maintain load/support nodes fixed. Avoid heavy members like area_id \'3\' unless absolutely necessary. Try a Warren or Pratt truss style with 3 nodes including supports and one or two intermediate nodes for better load path.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node above node_3 to form a triangular truss with nodes 1, 2, 3, and new node_6. Connect members from node_1 to node_6, node_6 to node_2, node_3 to node_6, node_1 to node_3, node_3 to node_2. Use smaller cross sections for bottom chord members, moderate for diagonals. Position node_6 at (3.5, 3.0) to create effective triangulation and reduce bending moments.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular truss reduces bending by converting loads into axial forces. New node_6 provides better load path for force from node_3 load. Shorter members reduce stress. Smaller areas reduce mass. Using area_id \'1\' or \'2\' for bottom chord and \'2\' or \'3\' for diagonals balances mass and strength. Avoid large area \'3\' or above to keep mass low. Keep node_3 at (2,0) fixed as load point.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_1(0,0) to node_6(3.5,3) length ~4.609, node_6 to node_2(6,0) length ~3.354, node_3(2,0) to node_6(3.5,3) length ~3.354, node_1 to node_3 length 2, node_3 to node_2 length 4. Use area_id \'2\' (0.782) for diagonals, \'1\' (0.195) for bottom chords. Estimate mass ~ sum(length*area). Check stresses expected to be within ±20 due to better force distribution.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Mass estimate: member_1(0-6): no direct member, members are 1-6 (4.609*0.782=3.605), 6-2 (3.354*0.782=2.622), 3-6 (3.354*0.782=2.622), 1-3 (2*0.195=0.39), 3-2 (4*0.195=0.78).
