Max stress ±20, max mass 30. Current max stress 38.22 exceeds limit.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has member_4 highly overstressed (-38.22). Mass is acceptable (10.87 < 30). Members with low area (1) are overstressed; increasing areas or redesigning geometry needed. Node_3 is between supports 1 and 2, load applied there, causing bending and high stress in diagonal members. Current triangular shape insufficient to distribute load within stress limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, add a new node above load node_3 to create a more stable truss with shorter members and better force paths. Increase cross-sectional areas selectively. Keep load/support nodes fixed. Avoid member_4 overstress by adding redundancy.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 above node_3 at (2.0, 4.0). Connect node_5 to node_1, node_2, and node_3 forming a diamond shape. Remove member_4 (node_3-node_4) to reduce overstress. Increase areas on critical members to reduce stress. Use area_id 3 or 4 for main load paths, smaller areas for others.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 creates two triangles sharing load at node_3 and distributes stresses better. Diamond shape reduces bending moments. Increasing area reduces stress by increasing capacity. Removing overstressed member_4 avoids failure. Member lengths are short, keeping mass moderate.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node positions: node_5 (2.0, 4.0).

Reduce areas on less stressed members to area_id 1 (0.195) for m1, m2, m5 and keep m3, m4 at 3 (1.759).
