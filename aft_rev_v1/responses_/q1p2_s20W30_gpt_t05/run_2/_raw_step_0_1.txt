To form a closed truss, add at least one more node off-axis to create triangular members. Triangles provide stability and reduce stress. The load at node_3 is downward-left. Supports at nodes 1 and 2 fix horizontal and vertical reactions. The truss should be symmetric or near-symmetric to balance forces and minimize stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 above x-axis between nodes 1 and 2, say at (3.0, 3.0) to form two triangles: (1-3-4) and (3-2-4).
