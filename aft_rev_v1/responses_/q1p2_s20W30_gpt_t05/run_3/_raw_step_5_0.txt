Member areas mostly large (area_id 3 and 2). Node_4 position at (2.3, 3.1) provides good geometry for load transfer. Further shifting node_4 or changing areas risks increasing stress or mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Previous iterations show attempts to reduce max stress and mass by adjusting node_4 and member areas. Current design is best compromise with low stress and mass under limit.",\n  "reasoning": "Since max stress is only 6.01 (far below Â±20) and mass is 26.6 (below 30), reducing member areas further may increase stress beyond limits. Moving node_4 closer to the load or support nodes risks higher stress concentrations. The current design balances geometry and member sizing well.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas produce acceptable stresses. Areas 3 and 2 correspond to mid-large cross sections, ensuring strength. Node_4 at (2.3, 3.1) maintains good truss shape.
