Load at node_3, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Node_4 moved from (2.3,3.3) to (2.4,3.0) improved stress. Areas mostly 2 or 3, moderate mass.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress reduced from 18.16 to 13.86 by adjusting node_4 position and member areas. Member_1 still highly stressed (-13.86), member_2 and member_5 lower stress. Member areas 2 and 3 keep mass moderate. Load at node_3 causes tension/compression in members attached. Node_3 fixed at (2,0), node_1 and node_2 fixed supports. Node_4 can be optimized further to reduce stress concentration especially on member_1 and member_4.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Try small vertical and horizontal adjustments to node_4 to balance force paths. Consider reducing area of member_4 from 3 to 2 to save mass and redistribute stress. Possibly increase area of member_1 to reduce stress if needed. Check if slight horizontal shift of node_4 towards node_3 reduces stress on member_1.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_1 stress is highest in compression (-13.86). Increasing its area from 2 to 3 (1.759 area) may reduce stress. Member_4 area can be reduced to 2 to compensate mass increase. Node_4 position at (2.4,3.0) can be shifted slightly left to reduce bending moment on member_1 and member_4. Node_4 x = 2.3 and y = 2.9 tried. This may balance load paths better, reduce peak stresses.
