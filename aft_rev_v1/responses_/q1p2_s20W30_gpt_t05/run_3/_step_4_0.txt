  "preamble": "Optimize node 4 position and member areas to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 9.09 < 20 limit, total mass 19.11 < 30 limit. Load at node_3, supports at nodes 1 and 2 fixed. Node_4 movable.",
  
  "analysis": "Stress distribution improved from previous iterations, max stress reduced significantly. Member_4 has highest compressive stress (-9.09). Areas chosen mostly moderate. Node_4 moved down from 3.0 to 2.9. Member_1 area increased to 3, member_2 and others moderate. Further stress reduction possible by fine tuning node_4 position and adjusting areas especially for member_4 and member_1.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing compressive stress on member_4 and tensile stress on member_1. Possibly raise node_4 slightly and adjust member_4 area to reduce stress concentration. Keep mass under 30.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_4 stress is highest compressive; increasing its area or slightly adjusting node_4 position to reduce axial force can lower stress. Member_1 area is largest, possibly optimized. Node_4 vertical position influences force distribution in members connected to it. Small upward move of node_4 may balance forces better. Member_2 area can be slightly increased to reduce stress. Use area codes from given set. Ensure closed truss shape preserved.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: m1 ~ length(node_1-node_3)=2.0, m2 ~ length(node_3-node_2)=4.0, m3 ~ length(node_1-node_4), m4 ~ length(node_3-node_4), m5 ~ length(node_2-node_4). Adjust node_4 y from 2.9 to ~3.1 to balance forces. Area codes: member_1 keep 3 (1.759), member_4 increase from 2 (0.782) to 3 (1.759), member_2 increase from 2 (0.782) to 3 (1.759), others adjusted accordingly.",
  
  "calculation": "New node_4 position: (2.3, 3.1). Member areas: member_1=3, member_2=3, member_3=3, member_4=3, member_5=2. Estimated mass increase acceptable, total mass ~21-22 < 30. Expected max stress reduction due to balanced forces and increased member areas. Verify no constraint violation.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Check no duplicate nodes/members, node_1 and node_2 fixed, node_3 fixed. Node_4 moved slightly upward. Areas adjusted to reduce stress in critical members. Closed truss maintained.",
