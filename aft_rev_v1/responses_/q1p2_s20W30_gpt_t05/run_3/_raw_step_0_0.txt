Need closed truss (all nodes connected forming at least one closed loop).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current nodes are colinear along x-axis. To form a closed truss, add at least one node above or below to form a triangle or polygon. Triangular truss is simplest closed shape, optimal for stress distribution. Add node_4 above node_3 to create two triangles: (node_1, node_3, node_4) and (node_3, node_2, node_4). Members connect all nodes forming closed loop. Use areas from given set to keep stress ≤20 and mass ≤30.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) for a near-equilateral triangle with base length 4 (between node_2 and node_3).

Calculate lengths and assign areas to keep stress and mass in limits.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular geometry distributes load efficiently, minimizing max stress. Adding node_4 at (2.0, 3.0) creates two triangles sharing node_4. Members along base are shorter, reducing mass. Use smaller cross-sectional areas on shorter members and larger on longer members under higher stress. Approximate stress from static equilibrium and tension/compression in members.

Assume uniform load distribution, tensile stress in members connecting loaded node. Assign areas: longer members get larger areas (e.g., area_id 3 or 4), shorter members smaller (area_id 1 or 2).
