Load at node_3, supports at node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_3 can move horizontally only; node_4 can move freely. Members connect nodes forming closed truss.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress concentrated in member_1 (-13.06), which is compressive and close to limit. Member_2 and member_5 have low stress, indicating potential to reduce area and mass. Member_4 has low compressive stress, member_3 moderate tension. Node_3 is on bottom chord, node_4 top chord. Moving node_4 slightly can reduce bending and stress in members. Reducing cross-section area in low-stress members can reduce mass and stress concentration. Aim to balance forces by adjusting node_4 position upward and slightly right to redistribute load. Also reduce area in members 2 and 5 from 3 and 2 to 1 or 0.782 to save mass and reduce stress. Increase area in member_1 slightly if needed to keep stress balanced. Maintain closed truss shape.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Node_1 and node_2 fixed. Node_3 fixed at (2.0,0.0) due to load. Node_4 move from (2.0,3.0) to (2.3,3.3) to optimize force distribution. Reduce member_2 area from 3 to 1, member_5 from 2 to 1. Member_1 keep at 2 or increase to 3 if stress rises. Member_3 keep at 3, member_4 keep at 4 for stability. Check mass and stress after changes.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Moving node_4 up and right increases triangle height and stiffness, reducing stress in bottom chord member_1. Reducing area in low-stress members reduces mass and stress concentration. Keeping member_4 area high maintains top chord stiffness. Node_3 fixed by load, node_1 and node_2 fixed by supports.
