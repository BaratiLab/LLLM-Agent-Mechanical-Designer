  "preamble": "Current 2D truss meets constraints with low max stress and acceptable mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 6.01 < 20, total mass 26.6 < 30, load and supports fixed, nodes mostly optimized.",
  "analysis": "Stress is well below limits and mass is within budget. Member areas mostly large (area_id 3 and 2). Node_4 position at (2.3, 3.1) provides good geometry for load transfer. Further shifting node_4 or changing areas risks increasing stress or mass.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Previous iterations show attempts to reduce max stress and mass by adjusting node_4 and member areas. Current design is best compromise with low stress and mass under limit.",
  "reasoning": "Since max stress is only 6.01 (far below Â±20) and mass is 26.6 (below 30), reducing member areas further may increase stress beyond limits. Moving node_4 closer to the load or support nodes risks higher stress concentrations. The current design balances geometry and member sizing well.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas produce acceptable stresses. Areas 3 and 2 correspond to mid-large cross sections, ensuring strength. Node_4 at (2.3, 3.1) maintains good truss shape. Load at node_3 fixed, supports fixed.",
  "calculation": "No changes to nodes or members recommended. Current max stress 6.01 < 20, total mass 26.6 < 30. All constraints satisfied.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Design is optimal given constraints and fixed nodes. Further optimization unlikely to reduce stress significantly without violating constraints or changing fixed nodes.",
