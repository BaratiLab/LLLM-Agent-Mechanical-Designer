Load at node_3, supports at nodes 1 and 2 fixed. Node_4 movable.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Stress distribution improved from previous iterations, max stress reduced significantly. Member_4 has highest compressive stress (-9.09). Areas chosen mostly moderate. Node_4 moved down from 3.0 to 2.9. Member_1 area increased to 3, member_2 and others moderate. Further stress reduction possible by fine tuning node_4 position and adjusting areas especially for member_4 and member_1.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing compressive stress on member_4 and tensile stress on member_1. Possibly raise node_4 slightly and adjust member_4 area to reduce stress concentration. Keep mass under 30.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_4 stress is highest compressive; increasing its area or slightly adjusting node_4 position to reduce axial force can lower stress. Member_1 area is largest, possibly optimized. Node_4 vertical position influences force distribution in members connected to it. Small upward move of node_4 may balance forces better. Member_2 area can be slightly increased to reduce stress. Use area codes from given set. Ensure closed truss shape preserved.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: m1 ~ length(node_1-node_3)=2.0, m2 ~ length(node_3-node_2)=4.0, m3 ~ length(node_1-node_4), m4 ~ length(node_3-node_4), m5 ~ length(node_2-node_4). Adjust node_4 y from 2.9 to ~3.1 to balance forces. Area codes: member_1 keep 3 (1.759), member_4 increase from 2 (0.782) to 3 (1.759), member_2 increase from 2 (0.782) to 3 (1.759), others adjusted accordingly.",\n  \n  "calculation": "New node_4 position: (2.3, 3.1).
