  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 position to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 18.16 is close to limit ±20. Mass 20.75 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Node_4 moved from (2,3) to (2.3,3.3) previously, reduced mass but max stress increased.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is on member_5 (18.16) tensile, member_1 and 2 have high compressive stress (~-13.5). Member areas are small on members 2 and 5 (areas 1 and 1). Node_4 position affects force distribution in diagonal members. Moving node_4 higher or adjusting horizontal position may balance forces and reduce peak stress. Cannot move load/support nodes. Mass is well below limit, so area can be increased on critical members if needed.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on reducing tensile stress on member_5 and compressive on member_2 by adjusting node_4. Possibly move node_4 slightly left and up to reduce member_5 elongation and redistribute forces.",
  
  "reasoning": "Member_5 connects node_2 (6,0) to node_4 (2.3,3.3). Its length and angle cause high tensile stress. Reducing vertical height or shifting node_4 left may reduce tensile force. Member_2 (node_3 to node_2) has compressive stress -13.55, maybe area can be increased or geometry adjusted. Member_4 has large area (4) but low stress (-2.27), area could be reduced to save mass and increase area of critical members. Overall, node_4 position is key to stress distribution.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths and angles for current node_4 position. Adjust node_4 x from 2.3 to ~2.1 and y from 3.3 to ~3.0 to reduce member_5 length and redistribute forces. Keep node_1,2,3 fixed. Consider increasing area of member_5 from 1 to 2 or 3 if stress remains high. Decrease area of member_4 from 4 to 3 or 2 to compensate mass increase.",
  
  "calculation": "Current member_5 length = sqrt((6-2.3)^2 + (0-3.3)^2) ≈ 4.87. Moving node_4 to (2.1,3.0) length ≈ sqrt((6-2.1)^2 + (0-3)^2) = sqrt(3.9^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(15.21 + 9) = sqrt(24.21) ≈ 4.92 (slightly longer). But angle changes may reduce tensile stress. Alternatively, move node_4 left to 1.9, up to 3.0: length = sqrt((6-1.9)^2 + (0-3)^2) = sqrt(4.1^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(16.81 + 9) = sqrt(25.81) ≈ 5.08 (longer). Longer member may increase stress. So better to move node_4 slightly right and lower: (2.4, 3.0): length = sqrt((6-2.4)^2 + (0-3)^2) = sqrt(3.6^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(12.96 + 9) = sqrt(21.96) ≈ 4.69 (shorter). This reduces member_5 length and potentially stress. Adjust member_4 area from 4 to 3, member_5 area from 1 to 2 to balance stress and mass. Member_2 area increase from 1 to 2 to reduce compressive stress. Mass recalculation: sum(length * area). Approximate lengths: member_1: node_1-node_3 (0,0)-(2,0) = 2.0; member_2: node_3-node_2 (2,0)-(6,0) = 4.0; member_3: node_1-node_4 (0,0)-(2.4,3.0) = sqrt(2.4^2+3^2)=3.84; member_4: node_3-node_4 (2,0)-(2.4,3.0)=sqrt(0.4^2+3^2)=3.02; member_5: node_2-node_4 (6,0)-(2.4,3.0)=4.69. Mass = 2*0.782 + 4*0.782 + 3.84*1.759 + 3.02*3.128 + 4.69*0.782 = 1.564 + 3.128 + 6.75 + 9.45 + 3.67 = 24.56 < 30. So within mass limit.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "New node_4 at (2.4,3.0), member areas adjusted: member_1:2, member_2:2, member_3:3, member_4:3, member_5:2. Expect reduced max stress, mass acceptable. Ready for next FEM evaluation.",
