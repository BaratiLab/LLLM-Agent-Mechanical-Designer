  "preamble": "Optimize closed 2D truss with 3 fixed nodes, minimize stress ≤ ±20, mass ≤ 30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0) with load at node_3 and supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Need closed truss so all nodes connected forming at least one closed loop. Minimize stress and mass under given constraints. First iteration, no previous assumptions.",
  
  "analysis": "Nodes are colinear initially, so to form a closed truss, add a new node above the line to create a triangle. Triangles are inherently stable and minimal for closed truss. Load on node_3 is downward-left at 45°, magnitude 10. Supports at node_1 and node_2 fix horizontal and vertical reactions. Triangular truss formed by nodes (node_1, node_2, new_node_4) with node_3 connected inside or as part of triangle. To minimize stress and mass, use minimal area members where possible, increase area in members under higher load.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Add node_4 above line between node_1 and node_2 to form triangle. Position node_4 at (3.0, 3.0) for symmetry and stability. Connect members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_1-node_2 (base), plus node_3 connected to node_1, node_2, and node_4 to ensure closed structure including node_3 and distribute loads.",
  
  "reasoning": "Triangular truss with apex at node_4 (3.0,3.0) forms stable closed loop with base nodes at (0,0) and (6,0). Node_3 at (2,0) lies on base line, connect it to node_4 to transfer load vertically. Members: base (node_1-node_2), sides (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4), plus node_3 connected to node_1 and node_4 for load path. Use area selection to keep stress ≤ 20 and mass ≤ 30. Approximate member lengths and forces using static equilibrium, assume linear elastic behavior, axial forces only. Calculate forces from load and reactions, then select areas from given discrete set to keep stress within limits. Mass = sum(length * area_id).",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: base = 6.0, sides ≈ sqrt(3²+3²)=4.2426, node_1-node_3=2.0, node_3-node_4=sqrt((3-2)²+3²)=3.1623. Forces: vertical load -10 at node_3 at 45° left-down. Reactions at pinned and roller support. Calculate axial forces by method of joints or sections. Approximate max force ~10-15 units. Stress = force/area. Choose area to keep stress ≤20, so area ≥ force/20. Use smallest areas possible to minimize mass. Sum mass and check ≤30.",
