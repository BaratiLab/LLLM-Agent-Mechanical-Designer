  "preamble": "Current truss satisfies constraints with low stress and mass well below limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress ±12.09 < ±20 and total mass 11.84 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. Nodes for load/support fixed.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design uses 5 members with areas mostly '2' and '1'. Stress distribution is moderate, max compressive stress ~12.1, max tensile ~8.5. Mass is low at 11.84, far below max 30. Node_3 at (2,0) and node_4 at (3,3) form a compact triangle with node_1 and node_2. No constraint violations.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress is balanced; members near load have moderate stress. No member close to stress or mass limits. Node repositioning limited to node_3 and node_4 only. Load/support nodes fixed.",
  
  "reasoning": "Further stress reduction possible by adjusting node_3 and node_4 positions to optimize force paths. However, current max stress is well below limit, and mass is low, indicating efficient design. Increasing cross-sectional areas would increase mass unnecessarily. Decreasing areas risks stress increase. Minor repositioning of node_4 upwards or node_3 slightly forward may reduce stress but marginally.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas determine mass; stress depends on load path and geometry. Current configuration forms stable triangular substructures. Load at node_3 downward-left, balanced by members to node_1 and node_4. Node_4 at (3,3) provides vertical support. Moving node_4 higher may reduce stress but increase member length and mass.",
  
  "calculation": "Current total mass 11.84 << 30, max stress 12.09 << 20. Member areas mostly '2' (0.782) which is moderate. No members overloaded. Minor node movement unlikely to significantly improve stress without increasing mass or complexity. Optimization likely converged.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Constraints met with margin; no further improvement justifies complexity. Stop optimization.",
