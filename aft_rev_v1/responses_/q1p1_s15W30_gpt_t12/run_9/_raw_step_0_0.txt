Constraints: max stress ±15 and mass ≤30. Goal: connect nodes to form a closed truss - implies all nodes connected and loop closed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Nodes fixed at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0). Load (-10 N at 45° down-left) at node_3 on x=2 line. Support at node_1 (pinned = fixed x,y), node_2 (roller = fixed y). To form closed truss from 3 nodes, must connect all 3 edges: node_1–node_2, node_2–node_3, node_3–node_1. These form basic triangle. This triangle is the truss unit. To reduce stress, add one additional node to reduce member length or add internal member in the truss.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Only 3 nodes currently, all in x-axis line: (0,0), (6,0), (2,0) - zero height. This line cannot form closed area truss on same y=0, structurally poorly performing. Add one node above x-axis to form a triangle with area for load path. Add node_4 at (2.5, 3.5) to provide apex support.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "The original nodes are colinear - no closed shape. To create closed truss, add a node_4 above to form triangle (node_1, node_2, node_4) and connect node_3 with others to distribute load. Design members connecting node_4 to all base nodes to carry load and create triangles. The member cross-sections will largely depend on force magnitude and length; select area from the table ensuring stress <15 and total mass <30. Use approximate axial stress = force / area, mass approx = sum member_length * area (using areas ids as proportional to cross-sectional area). Assume modulus proportional to area for stress simplification.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: Load is fully transferred via axial forces in members. Forces resolved by static equilibrium (sum Fx=0, sum Fy=0, sum moments=0). Member axial force estimated via geometry of triangle.
