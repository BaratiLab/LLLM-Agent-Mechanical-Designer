Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller fixed. Node_1 and node_2 fixed; only node_4 movable. Max allowable stress +-15, mass <30. Current max stress 12.06, mass 28.35 under limits.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The highest stress in magnitude occurs in member_2 (-12.059). Members near node_4 carry significant loads. The structure is stable and within constraints but can be improved to reduce stress near limits. Node_4 positioning affects stress in members 4,5,6. Reducing member lengths and adjusting geometry to align better with load paths could reduce max stress and mass, improving safety margin.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on moving node_4 slightly horizontally and vertically to reduce force on member_2. Lower stress in compression members by redistributing geometry. Ensure closed loop remains intact and no load/support node position changed.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Node_4 is crucial for force distribution in top triangular loop. By slightly moving node_4 left and lowering Y, we can reduce compressive forces in member_2 and adjacent members. Reducing vertical offset reduces bending moments and axial forces in the truss members. This geometric adjustment helps reduce overall member forces, thus lower max stress and slightly reduces length/mass of some members. This will maintain mass under prescribed limit. Keeping areas same as basis to avoid complexity.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_1:(0,0), node_2:(6,0) pinned & roller fixed; node_3:(2,0) load applied; move node_4 from (2.5,3.5) to approx (2.3,3.0). This reduces length and stress in member_2 and related members. Areas retained: member_1 area_id=\'1\', members 2 and 3 area_id=\'2\', members 4-6 area_id=\'3\' appreciating previous findings.
