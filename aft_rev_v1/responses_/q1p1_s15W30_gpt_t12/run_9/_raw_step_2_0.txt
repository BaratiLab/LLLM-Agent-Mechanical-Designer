Node_1 and node_2 fixed (supports), load at node_3 fixed, node_4 movable. Areas fixed per member. Current max stress at member_2 (-12.26) close to limit, reducing that is priority.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max compressive stress is 12.26 (member_2), critical. Current layout shifted node_4 inward and down from iteration 0 reduced mass and stress slightly. Member areas favor larger areas (3 for top members). Members connected to node_4 seem key for stress redistribution. Current mass is 26.1935 well under 30, gives some flexibility to adjust if needed.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider moving node_4 closer horizontally between node_1 and node_2 to redistribute force paths, potentially lowering high stress in member_2 (node_2-node_3). Improving angle for member force flow around node_3 (loaded node) critical as it\'s fixed. Nodal move vertically moderate to balance compressive and tensile forces in diagonals.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Member_2 (node_1-node_3) axial stress highly compressive likely due to load at node_3 pulling at 45 deg and fixed horizontal nodes. Wider triangular height may help reduce bending and reduce compressive force. Need to keep node_4 inside triangle formed by node_1, node_2, node_3 for closed truss. Also reducing length of higher stressed member_2 helps reduce stress. Slight increase of vertical position from 3.0m to ~3.2 and move node_4 slightly to right may balance forces better.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assuming linear stress proportion to load and member geometry, increase node_4 y from 3.0 to 3.2m and x from 2.3 to 2.5m. Check member length changes. Areas for members remain unchanged because mass limits allow current selection.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Updated node_4: From (2.3, 3.0) to (2.5,3.2). Lengths and member orientations adjusted: This should reduce compressive peak in member_2 and member_6, less stress in main diagonal can reduce max stress. Falling mass expected or constant as member lengths stay similar. Mass well below max 30 allowed. Verify no violation of support/load position fixed at node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0).",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify sum(member length Ã— area) <=30. Member areas unchanged, masses expected slightly reduced or steady. Stress should redistribute lowering max stress under margin 15. Ready for FEM re-run to confirm but feasible optimal next step.
