  "preamble": "Optimize node_4 vertical position to reduce max compressive stress member_2 while keeping constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress -12.4 on member_2 (compressive), total mass 27.04 < 30 limit. Load and supports fixed nodes. Members areas 1,2,3 used. Adjust node_4 y to reduce stress and mass within limits.",
  
  "analysis": "Member_2 has highest compressive stress (-12.4) close to allowable limit (-15). Mass is within constraint but increased from previous state. Node_4 shifted up increased stress and mass slightly from iteration_1. Member_4,5,6 area=3 might be reduced in area to lower mass and stress proportionally if stress allows. Moving node_4 down slightly closer to iteration_1 but adjusting for stress improvement.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Lowering node_4 y mildly expected to reduce member_2 compressive stress, member_4,5,6 member length will reduce, lowering mass. Keep node_4 x close to 2.3-2.5 range to maintain geometric stability.",
  
  "reasoning": "Max stress limiter is compressive on the diagonal base chord member member_2 between node_1 and node_3. Lowering node_4 Y reduces force in diagonal members from load at node_3. Maintain load/support node positions. Area assignment I keep same as initial: member_1: area_id 1, member_2,3: area_id 2, members 4,5,6: area_id 3 - or can reduce area of those tension members later if stress is well below limit. Geometry adjustment should target geometric stiffening to lower compression in member_2.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Height_node_4 moved down from 3.2 m to ~3.0 m previously improved mass and stress. Try y=3.05 to balance improving compressive stress member_2 and moderate mass. X of node_4 kept at 2.4 for balance. Member lengths approximated for mass check. Re-calculate member lengths as all member connections fixed.",

  "calculation": "Node_4 from (2.5,3.2) → (2.4,3.05). Member lengths: m4 (node_1-node_4) ~ sqrt((2.4^2)+(3.05^2))=3.87m, m5 (node_2-node_4) ~ sqrt((3.6^2)+(3.05^2))=4.77m, m6 (node_3-node_4) ~ sqrt((0.4^2)+(3.05^2))=3.08m vs prior 4.13,5.14,3.68m. Reduced member lengths lowers mass. Assuming stress decrease in member_2 (from -12.4→~ -11) due to vertical lowering, still within safety. Mass recalculated: member mass = length * area density(for area 3=1.759). Total mass near 26.5 < 27 then reduction improved mass. Maintain areas same for stress capacity.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Node_4 downward y move balances better compressive stress reduction and lower mass. Members and node placement valid within constraints: no duplicate, support/load nodes fixed, continuous closed truss. Ready for next evaluation step.",
