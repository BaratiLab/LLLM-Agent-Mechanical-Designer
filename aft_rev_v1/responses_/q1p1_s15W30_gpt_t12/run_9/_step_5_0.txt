  "preamble": "Optimizing 2D truss node_4 position to minimize stresses within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Node_4 moved slightly in previous steps; max stress close to 12.57 under limit ±15. Mass reduced to 25.56 <30 max. Load and supports fixed.",
  
  "analysis": "Load applied at node_3 causes high compressive stress on member_2 (-12.567) near the stress limit. Node_4 position controls force distribution among members 4,5,6. Minimal mass achieved by selecting tight area profile. Increasing node_4 height increased mass beyond desirable. Current position at (2.35,2.85) reduces mass and keeps balance.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Attempting to shift node_4 further may increase member_masses or stress. Members have reasonable areas assigned (area_id=3 corresponds to area 1.759). Other area choices for high-stress members might increase masses. Current mass and stress near optimal.",
  
  "reasoning": "Avoid moving load/support nodes (node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed). Only node_4 can be adjusted. Previous iterative trend pushing node_4 coordinates down reduces mass. Any shift too far reduces stiffness increasing stress. Members areas adequate given mass budget. Stress in members mostly tensile/compressive within ±15 limit, no active constraint violation. Further shifting likely leads to worse performance.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member area assignments fixed as in history step 4. Node_4 slight reduction in y from last iteration decreased mass and held stresses just below limit. Member 2 highest compressive stress tolerance may dictate current morphology trade-off. No new members or nodes allowed per instruction.",
  
  "calculation": "Mass = 25.556 (below max 30). Max stress = 12.57 (below allowable 15). Node_4 at (2.35, 2.85) gives minimum stress with acceptable member stress distribution. No redundant or duplicate members/nodes. Stress balance and mass landscape flat with minor perturbations around last updated coordinate.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "No improved candidate seen in previous attempts. Load, supports fixed. Node_4 positioned near an optimum location. Node coordinate and placement fixed to maintain optimal trades between mass and stress.",
