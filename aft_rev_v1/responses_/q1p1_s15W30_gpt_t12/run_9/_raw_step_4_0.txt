Load and supports fixed at node_3 and node_1/2. Only node_4 movable, currently at (2.4, 3.05). Members consistent with previous iterations. Areas assigned as per last iteration.",\n  "analysis": "Member_2 (between node_1 and node_3) has highest max compressive stress near limit (-12.4). Member_4 and member_5 show moderate tensile stresses (~2-3). To reduce high compressive stresses, reposition node_4 to reduce eccentricity and redistribute load more evenly across members, alter internal geometry to reduce reliance on member_2 and member_6. Smaller vertical displacement at node_4 compared to previous helps mass but stress remained similar. Consider slight lateral movement of node_4 closer to load axis to balance forces better.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider node_4 shift (x,y): current 2.4,3.05 shift closer to node_3\'s horizontal line but higher or slightly left to reduce compressed dominance in member_2. Areas from iteration_3 generally optimized; improve geometry rather than area changes. Minimize member_2 stress by moving node_4 slightly downward and left (e.g., 2.3-2.35 in x, 2.8-3.0 in y). Check mass impact due to length changes.",\n  "reasoning": "Reducing node_4 vertical elevation minimizes lever arm causing high compressive stress on member_2; moderate lateral shift can prevent unintended stress increase in member_3/5. Maintaining simple triangular shape keeps model closed, minimal members added. Areas unchanged: member_2 and 3 at \'2\':0.782, members connected to node_4 at \'3\':1.759 seem sufficient, avoiding mass increase. This strategy should keep max stress below allowed 15 and total mass under 30 while improving stress distribution.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Assumptions: constant loads and supports, areas from iteration_3 optimized. Calculated member lengths roughly consistent with Pythagoras. Approximate effect of node_4 movement: length(node_1-node_4) shorter if lower y, stress drop expected if higher stress in member_2 is due to geometry. Execute update node_4 from (2.4, 3.05) to (2.35, 2.85). Predict smaller mass due to reduced length in long members, stress stabilization from better force distribution.",\n  "calculation": "Node_4 new proposed position: x=2.35, y=2.85 (float values precise). No change to nodes 1, 2, 3. Member connections same. Areas re-used from last iteration. Check quick approximate length changes: \\n - member_4 length ~ sqrt((2.35-0)^2 + (2.85-0)^2) ≈ 3.72, previous ~3.9\\n - member_5 length ~ sqrt((6-2.35)^2 + (0-2.85)^2) ≈ 4.46 vs previous ~4.6\\n Reduced removal of compressive load from member_2 possible.\\n Mass estimated slightly reduced or same < 27, stresses redistributed lower than 12.4 max.\\n Stop condition False since improvement feasible.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Node positions within allowed movement, load and supports fixed.
