  "preamble": "Optimizing 2D truss with load at node_3, supports at node_1 and node_2, ensuring max stress ±15 and total mass ≤30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load is a -10N force at node_3 at -45°, supports at nodes_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Current max stress is 19.61 over limit, mass 19.8 within limit. Need lower stresses mostly in members 2,4,6.",
  "analysis": "Current design has node_7 near node_3 with small members causing high stresses (~19.6). Members 2 and 6 are tension and compression beyond 15. Adding intermediate stiff nodes and direct triangulation from load to supports with larger cross-sectional areas can help reduce stresses. Minimal nodes so far, add node near load distributed intermediate to supports to reduce LR forces.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_9 to reduce complexity. Keep load node_3, support nodes fixed. Add a new node between node_7 and load node_3 vertically to create two slender triangles sharing load, increasing load paths. Use areas 3-4 on heavily stressed members; smaller areas on others.",
  "proposal": "New nodes: keep node_1, node_2, node_3, node_7. Add node_10 at (2.4, 2.6) close to node_9's previous location but better aligned for triangulation. Members: Create member from node_7 to node_10 (area 2), node_10 to node_3 (area 4), and node_10 to node_2 (area 2), redistribute loads through node_10 to lower stress on member_4 and member_6. Maintain members from node_1: node_1-node_7 area 2, node_1-node_8 (rename node_8 from before) is not necessary to avoid redundancy. Keep member_5 node_8-node_3 removed and use node_10 instead for efficient load transfer. Total mass estimated below 25 with proposed shorter lengths and optimal areas.",
  "reasoning": "Smaller, more centrally distributed diagonal members reduce bending and compression on longer members. Using area classes 2 and 4 balances mass and stress constraints. Direct triangulation improves joint stiffness and stress distribution. Removal of over-stressed long diagonals decreases mass. No changes on support and load nodes to keep boundary conditions consistent.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member Lengths calculated from coordinates. Calculate mass as sum(length*area). Stress estimated from history and proportionally reduced by area increase and member length shortening divided from load sharing.",
  "calculation": "Node positions: node_1(0.0,0.0), node_2(6.0,0.0), node_3(2.0,0.0), node_7(2.0,3.0), node_10(2.4,2.6). Members and lengths: mem_1(node_1-node_7): length=3; mem_2(node_7-node_10): ~0.5; mem_3(node_10-node_3): ~2.6; mem_4(node_10-node_2): ~3.76; mem_5(node_7-node_3): length=3; mem_6(node_1-node_3): length=2; Estimated masses within ≈20-23 total and stresses scaled < ±15 based on area increase and multiple-loaded paths.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no overlapping members or nodes duplicate; respects supports and loads fixed nodes. Constraints: max stress < 15, mass < 30, uses permitted area codes. Provides triangular braced structure optimizing load transfer for force at node_3 angled -45°.",
