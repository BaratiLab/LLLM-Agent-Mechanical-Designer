Supports: node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Nodes mostly along base and upper region. Constraints: max stress ±15, max mass 30. Areas must be from given discrete series.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design at iteration 2 has max stress 85.18 (far above ±15 limit) and mass 28.25 (~under max 30). High stresses occur mainly in members connected to node_6. Areas are somewhat large, indicating overload. Structure is statically indeterminate and nonsymmetrical placement might cause stress concentration. To reduce stresses, structure and member sizes must be revised: add more triangulation for stiffness, reduce length or redistribute load paths. Node_6 position and connectivity increases complexity and stress.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reconsider node_6 inclusion; possibly remove node_6 for simplification. Increase triangulation from node_4 and node_3 connections to spread loads. Keep node_4 at (2.0,2.0) for triangulation. Use smaller areas broadly, larger areas only on critical members. Node_5 may be added around (4,2.5) for better load path as in previous iteration 1 but optimized better.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep original nodes node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4. Remove node_6. Add node_5 at (4.2, 2.3) to spread load better. Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_5, node_5-node_3, node_5-node_2. Use optimized areas mostly area_id \'1\' or \'2\' (0.195, 0.782) for low stresses, and \'3\' or \'4\' only if needed. Resulting mass anticipated <30 and stress <±15.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangulated 2D truss with clear load path limits bending and reduces stress. Removing excess nodes reducing irregular members. Moderate member lengths with fine area selections balance mass and strength. Redistribution ensures axial forces stay under ±15 stress limit. Nodes fixed for load/support; addition aids stiffness. Iterative FEM indicates this layout better conforms to constraints.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculations for mass: compute Euclidean length, multiply by area density from area_look_up. Cross-check stresses from member orientation and force distribution to assign needed area. Ensure major load bearing members get bigger area from set. Keep total mass <30.

Order members logically to avoid duplicates.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Lengths: node_1(0,0) to node_4(2,2)=2.828, node_4 to node_3(2,0)=2.0, node_3 to node_2(6,0)=4.0, node_1 to node_5(4.2,2.3)=~4.59, node_5 to node_3= sqrt((4.2-2)^2+(2.3-0)^2)=~2.73, node_5 to node_2= sqrt((6-4.2)^2+ (0-2.3)^2)=~2.85.\\nMass = sum(length * area_density).
