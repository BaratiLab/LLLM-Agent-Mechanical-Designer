Current max stress is 19.61 over limit, mass 19.8 within limit. Need lower stresses mostly in members 2,4,6.",\n  "analysis": "Current design has node_7 near node_3 with small members causing high stresses (~19.6). Members 2 and 6 are tension and compression beyond 15. Adding intermediate stiff nodes and direct triangulation from load to supports with larger cross-sectional areas can help reduce stresses. Minimal nodes so far, add node near load distributed intermediate to supports to reduce LR forces.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_9 to reduce complexity. Keep load node_3, support nodes fixed. Add a new node between node_7 and load node_3 vertically to create two slender triangles sharing load, increasing load paths. Use areas 3-4 on heavily stressed members; smaller areas on others.",\n  "proposal": "New nodes: keep node_1, node_2, node_3, node_7. Add node_10 at (2.4, 2.6) close to node_9\'s previous location but better aligned for triangulation. Members: Create member from node_7 to node_10 (area 2), node_10 to node_3 (area 4), and node_10 to node_2 (area 2), redistribute loads through node_10 to lower stress on member_4 and member_6. Maintain members from node_1: node_1-node_7 area 2, node_1-node_8 (rename node_8 from before) is not necessary to avoid redundancy. Keep member_5 node_8-node_3 removed and use node_10 instead for efficient load transfer. Total mass estimated below 25 with proposed shorter lengths and optimal areas.",\n  "reasoning": "Smaller, more centrally distributed diagonal members reduce bending and compression on longer members. Using area classes 2 and 4 balances mass and stress constraints. Direct triangulation improves joint stiffness and stress distribution. Removal of over-stressed long diagonals decreases mass. No changes on support and load nodes to keep boundary conditions consistent.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member Lengths calculated from coordinates. Calculate mass as sum(length*area).
