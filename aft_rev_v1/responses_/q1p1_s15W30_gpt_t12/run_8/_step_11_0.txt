  "preamble": "Minimize max stress below 15 while respecting mass < 30; refine node 8's position and redistribute member areas",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 13.65 is close to limit; mass 27.67 close to max 30. Members 1-4 have area 3, member 5 area 2. Loads are at node_3; supports fixed for nodes 1 and 2; movable nodes 7 and 8.",
  
  "analysis": "Member 4 (node_8-node_3) has near-limit tensile stress ~13.65, others lower. Node_8 close to node_7 (3.1,2.9) slightly lower Y may improve force distribution. Areas all equal (except member 5 area 2). Mass slightly under limit but can be reused to optimize.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress concentrates on members connected to node 3 and node 8. Member length and orientation influence stress; moving node_8 lower and slightly left reduces tension on member_4. Adjust area assignments to tailor cross sections, especially reducing area where stress is very low (members 1,2) and boosting member_4 area if stress remains high.",
  
  "reasoning": "Node_7 fixed at (2,3) since it carries load paths; node_3 fixed at (2,0) due to load. Nodes_1,2 - supports fixed. Move node_8 from (3.1,2.9) to approx (2.7, 2.6) to reduce length and angle of member_4 to reduce stress. Assign member areas as: reduce members 1,2 to area 2 (1.759), member_4 area 4 (3.128) to handle tension, others remain area 3 (1.759) or tweak to reduce mass and stress. This contributes to redistributing load and lowering peak stress.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate length for moved node_8, new member lengths: member_4 shorter by ~0.5 units, stress inversely related to area and length. New area assignments reduce mass: expected mass less than 29. Total length * area weighted sum ~28.5 estimated. Max stress reduced by geometry improvement and increased area for member_4. Verify no violation of stress <15 and mass <30.",

  "calculation": "Nodes:\n node_1: (0.0, 0.0) fixed\n node_2: (6.0, 0.0) fixed\n node_3: (2.0, 0.0) fixed\n node_7: (2.0, 3.0) fixed\n node_8: moved to (2.7, 2.6)\nMembers:\n - 'member_1': ('node_1', 'node_7', '2') area=1.759 length ~3.605 mass=~6.34 *1.759/3=~3.7 less than previous\n - 'member_2': ('node_1', 'node_8', '2') length=~3.41 area=1.759 mass=~6.0\n - 'member_3': ('node_7', 'node_3', '3') same area 1.759 length=3 mass=5.3\n - 'member_4': ('node_8', 'node_3', '4') area=3.128 length ~ 2.96 mass~9.24 increase area to reduce stress\n - 'member_5': ('node_3', 'node_2', '2') same, area=0.782, length 4 mass ~3.1\nEstimated total mass < 29",
