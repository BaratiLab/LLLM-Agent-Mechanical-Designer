Supports pinned and roller at node_1 and node_2. Need a closed truss, with max stress ≤ ±15, mass ≤ 30. Areas chosen from discrete set 0 to 10.",\n\n    "analysis": "To ensure the structure is stable and closed (all nodes connected in a rigid framed loop), and considering we have three nodes mostly on the x-axis (0,0), (2,0), (6,0), the current nodes are colinear or near-colinear; truss with nodes on one line is unstable unless additional nodes or vertical displacement is added. We must add at least one node to create a 2D shape (triangle, quadrilateral). However, constraints say don\'t move existing nodes, but new nodes can be added. So, add a single new node above the line near node_3 to create a triangular closed truss. This supports the load better. Select member areas and connectivity to minimize stress and mass. The load pushes down + left, so a node slightly vertically elevated above node_3 helps to better distribute forces. Choose member areas to keep stress ≤ 15 with safety margin. The max mass comes from sum of lengths × area. Areas increment discretely: select small areas on longest members to reduce mass.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Add new node near node_3, at x=2, y=2 (vertical uplift approx), build members forming a triangle (1-3-new, 3-2, 2-1, 3-new, new-1). Check length, force distribution using simple truss analysis assuming pin-jointed truss in 2D. Use geometric lengths using Pythagoras; member force = Load / sin or cos of angles. Areas increase with expected force / (σ_max). Pick minimum area ≥ required for each member.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Add node_4 = (2.0, 2.0) (vertical up above node_3). Connect members to form closed triangle: members (node_1-node_4), (node_4-node_3), (node_3-node_2), (node_2-node_1). This gives four members in a quadrilateral shape (3+1 new node). All nodes connected, stable. The pinned support at node_1 and roller at node_2 allow reaction forces to develop. The external load (-10 N at -45°) at node_3 creates tension/compression in members. Length of members and force resolve to optimize area ids. Use basic statics: sum of moments and equilibrium in x,y to find member forces approximately.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_1-node_4 = sqrt((2-0)^2 + (2-0)^2) = 2.828, node_4-node_3 = sqrt((2-2)^2 + (2-0)^2) = 2.0, node_3-node_2 = 4.0, node_2-node_1 = 6.0. Horizontal base (1-2). Force equilibrium and vertical: Reaction forces at supports with load vector (-10*cos45, -10*sin45) = (-7.07, -7.07).

For 7N: area ≥ 0.466 needed; closest from list is 0.782(area 2). For 5N: area ≥ 0.333, nearest 0.782 or 0.195; 0.195 gives stress ~25 >15(not good), so pick 0.782. Sum mass = Sum (length×area) = (2.828×0.782)+(2.0×0.782)+(4.0×0.782)+(6.0×0.195)=2.212 + 1.564 + 3.128 + 1.17=8.074 ≤30 allowed.
