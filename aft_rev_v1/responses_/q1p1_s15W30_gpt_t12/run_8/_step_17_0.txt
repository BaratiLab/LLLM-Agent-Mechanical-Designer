  "preamble": "Current design at iteration 16/25 meets constraints with low max stress and acceptable mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Goal: minimize max stress <=15 and total mass <=30 while maintaining current closed truss form and constraints.",
  
  "analysis": "Current max stress 12.49 < 15, total mass 22.1 < 30. Node positions for load and supports fixed. Intermediate nodes placed to maintain truss shape. Members mostly with area codes 2 (0.782) and 3 (1.759). Stress distribution balanced, no member near constraint limit. Minor compressive and tensile stresses observed.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Max stress well controlled; mass under limit. Member 1 at -12.487 stress close to limit but acceptable. Current node 13 located well up along y=3.5 enhances load path. Further node reshaping may not reduce stress significantly without violating constraints.",
  
  "reasoning": "Stress minimized with the current member areas and node placements. Following design rules: fixed load/support nodes different from free node 13. Considering constraints, moving node_13 upward beyond 3.5 may slightly reduce tension in member_2 but increase other stresses or mass due to longer members or more area needed. Reducing area id below 2 might increase stress beyond limits, increase might increase mass unnecessarily.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Checked area selection from {0:1,1:0.195,...}. Area ids currently 2 or 3 balance mass and strength. Member lengths and geometry are optimal for load distribution from previous iterations. Stress already below limit by >2.5 margins.",
  
  "calculation": "Member lengths approximately unchanged. E.g. member_3 length ~ distance(node_13,node_1) = sqrt(2^2+3.5^2)=~4.03. Stress proportional inversely to area and depends on length/load path. With current data, stress margin >2.5 units to limit. Trying smaller height for node_13 reduces vertical member forces but shifts stresses to horizontal members, tends to degrade max stress.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints met, iteration 16 achieves good stress and mass profiles. Optimize halted to avoid redundant steps and mass increase. Current design optimal within constraints.",
