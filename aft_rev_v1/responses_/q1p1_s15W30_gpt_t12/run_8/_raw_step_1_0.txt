Aim: Max |stress| ≤ 15, total mass ≤ 30. Areas discrete from set, currently member_4 overstressed (-36.26 > allowable -15). Mass currently acceptable (8.07 < 30). Need to reduce stress in member_4 primarily, possibly redistributing load paths by redesigning members and cross members around loaded node 3.",\n    \n    "analysis": "The highly overstressed member_4 (between node_2 and node_1) is likely carrying large axial load. The current layout is insufficient for the diagonal load at node_3. The simple 4-node rectangular pattern lacks triangulation on the right side near the load, causing member_4 to be overstressed and other members underutilized. The cross-bracing near loaded node_3 is suboptimal (existing member_2 from node_4 to node_3). Moving node_4 or adding an intermediate node can better channel forces and reduce load on member_4. Member areas can be optimized but stressed members require geometric modification primarily.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Potential improvements: add a node above node_3 (vertical direction), introduce diagonal members forming triangles from load/support nodes, redistribute member sizes using smaller areas in low-stress members, larger area in high-stress members but within limits. Keep load/support nodes fixed. Aim for triangular layouts typical for planar trusses (Warren or Pratt style features).",\n    \n    "proposal": "Add node_5 at (4.0, 2.5) above node_3 to create triangular patterns. Replace member_2 with two members from node_4 and node_5 to node_3. Add diagonal member_6 from node_5 to node_2. Remove tense member_4 (node_2-node_1) to reduce overloading and replace with diagonal members joining new node_5 and original support nodes. Areas assigned to keep stresses within ±15 and total mass ≤30: higher area where stress near limits, lower otherwise.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Adding node_5 increases structural stability by creating a truss configuration to better direct force flows. Nodes fixed for supports and load ensure boundary conditions maintained. By reassigning members to force direct triangulation, member forces are balanced (less concentration in member_4). Selecting member areas with appropriate cross sections optimize mass and ensure allowable stresses. Using distinct, precise coordinates ensures no duplicates. Triangular typical truss configurations are structurally efficient under load. The assigned areas reduce tensile and compressive forces below maximum stress allowable.",\n    \n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate geometry lengths: member_1 (node_1 to node_4), member_2 upgraded to (node_4-node_3) and (node_5-node_3), member_3 (node_3-node_2), member_4 eliminated, member_5 (node_1-node_5), member_6 (node_5-node_2). Assign areas to keep forces ≤15. Estimate lengths, calculate mass (sum length * area). Iterate if any mass or stress violation occurs. Expected member lengths: ~ (node_1-node_4) ~2.828, node_4-node_3=abs(x4-x3,y4-y3), etc. Use areas mostly from midrange of areas set except for low stress members getting area 1 or 0.195 and critical near limit members getting higher areas such as 3.128-4.887.",\n    \n    "calculation": "Lengths: (1,4)=2.828, (4,3)=2.0, (5,3)=2.121, (3,2)=4.0, (1,5)=4.031, (5,2)=2.915.
