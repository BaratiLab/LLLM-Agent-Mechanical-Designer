Previous designs have issues with overstressed members and mass mostly under 30 but stresses exceed limits.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current iteration (#11) shows member_4 is highly overstressed (335) and members 2 and 3 stress also far exceed constraints. Mass is 22.57, below max 30. Members 2 and 4 have large areas but inappropriate geometry causing high stresses. Previous designs indicate 3D truss with nodes at x=2, y around 3, connecting key nodes. Repeated area + geometry mismatch causes extreme stresses.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Must revise layout to redistribute forces better, reduce stress concentrations, increase stability by introducing additional nodes that help triangulation, optimize member cross-sections. Areas should be minimized to control mass while stresses within ±15. Avoid large eccentricities of load transfer lines.",\n\n    "proposal": "Add one node between node_7 and node_8 roughly around the load to divert forces. Reposition node_8 slightly above and towards node_2 for better triangulation. Use lower area members on diagonals and minimal area for compression links. Connect members to form steady triangular units. 5 members total for stability and efficiency, use up to area 3 for members transmitting major load, smaller areas for links under less demand.",\n\n    "reasoning": "The diagonal members effectively handle axial forces if arranged properly triangulating load paths. Enlarging the effective vertical height from base points node_1 and node_2 helps diminish member length, distributing stresses. Using smaller area IDs lowers mass while careful geometry helps keep stresses under control. Connections emphasize direct load path from load node to supports node_1 and node_2. Avoid long compressive members prone to buckling by keeping slender length and adequate cross section.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Nodes fixed: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0); add new nodes \'node_8\' and \'node_9\' at optimized positions around (3.2, 2.9) and (2.8,2.6). Members connecting node_1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9 form stable truss forming triangles. Areas selected: close to 2-3 range for most stressed areas, smaller (1) for shorter links. Estimated member lengths calculated for mass ≈ 25 <30, and stresses <±15 assumed due to better geometry and small areas.",\n\n    "calculation": "Length calculations, e.g. between node_1(0,0) and node_7(2,3) is sqrt(2^2+3^2)=3.606m, area_id=2(0.782); mass estimate ~ 3.606*0.782=2.82. Other joints similarly approximate mass summing about 25. Compute from load transfer and member force equilibrium estimations. Stresses reduced by shortening critical compressive/tensile links and appropriate areas.",\n    "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no duplicate nodes or members, ensure supports and loading nodes fixed. No overstress above ±15. Total mass ≤30.
