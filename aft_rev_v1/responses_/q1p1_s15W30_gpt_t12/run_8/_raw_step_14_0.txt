Current design iteration 13 exceeded stress limit (24.95) and mass 20.63 under torsion/compression. Load at node_3 diagonally down-left. Support nodes fixed; must maintain structure supporting load reliably with minimized mass and below stress.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure forms a top triangle via node_7 and node_10 with members joining load node to supports and intermediate nodes. The problematic member causing over stress is member_2 between node_7 and node_10 (stress 24.95). Member_3 (node_10-node_3) has zero stress, suggesting load transfer is suboptimal. Mass is within limits but stress not. Existing load at node_3 is (-10.0, -45°), pulling diagonally down-left. Minimizing tensile and compressive stresses requires better force distribution, ideally triangular bracing to route load to supports efficiently.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_2 causing excessive stress indicates node_7 to node_10 connection does not effectively transfer load, suggesting need for stronger or re-positioned upper nodes or alternative bracing. Member areas mostly low to moderate, possible to increase area or realign nodes for better force path. Current design inefficient; slight node reposition and additional intermediate node to enhance load path preferred over major redesign. Use simpler two-triangle bracing with smaller members taken accordingly.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Maintain node_1, node_2, node_3 as fixed. Keep node_7 directly above node_3 at (2.0, 3.2) to top center structural support roughly. Add a new node_11 between node_7 and node_2 at (4.0, 2.2) for a second triangle. Member connections: node_1-node_7, node_7-node_3, node_7-node_11, node_11-node_3, node_11-node_2, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_3. Use areas mostly \'2\' (0.782) for main members, importing \'3\' (1.759) for stress-critical members and \'1\' (0.195) for secondary tensile path. Aim to distribute load directly through shorter efficient members, avoiding large tension/compression each member carries alone.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "By repositioning node_7 slightly higher (2.0, 3.2) and introducing node_11 at (4.0, 2.2), the truss creates two near-equilateral triangles distributing load effectively. Member lengths balanced to keep stress under ±15. Areas assigned proportional to force transmission expected from shorter members (less prone to buckling). Keeping node_3 centralized aligns with load and support geometry. This setup reduces stress in tensions and compression shunting forces progressively, improving load path and mass economy.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member vector lengths; estimate forces approximately by direct geometry: e.g., from node_3 horizontal base 6.0, heights node_7 at 3.2, node_11 at 2.2. Assign area IDs per length and load to ensure stresses <15. Zero stress at middle members validates chosen arrangements; member masses sum below 30. Member cross section IDs chosen conservatively for safety margin.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths (approx):\\\n  node_1-node_7 = 3.2,\\\n  node_7-node_3 = 3.2,\\\n  node_7-node_11 = ~2.236,\\\n  node_11-node_3 = ~2.236,\\\n  node_11-node_2 = ~1.9,\\\n  node_3-node_2 = 4.0,\\\n  node_1-node_3 = 2.0.\\\n  Using chosen areas:\\\n  assign \'3\' (1.759) to node_1-node_7 & node_7-node_3 & node_11-node_2 (critical load sake), \'2\'(0.782) to node_1-node_3, node_7-node_11, node_11-node_3, \'4\'(3.128) to base node_3-node_2 member since subjected to bending and large force. Total estimated mass ~ 0.78*3.2*4 + small additions well below 30. Max stress estimated <15 with chosen column and bracing members reinforcing tension/compression branches.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Complete to check no duplicated nodes or members, ensure node positions preserved for load/support.
