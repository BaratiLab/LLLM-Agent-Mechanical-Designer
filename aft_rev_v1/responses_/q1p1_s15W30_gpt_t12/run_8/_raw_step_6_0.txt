Supports pinned at node_1, roller at node_2 fixed. Current max stress 61.95 > 15 limit and mass 22.424 < 30 is good. Need to reduce stress significantly.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High compressive stress (-61.9) on member_5 (node_1-node_3) violates stress limit. Members 4 and 5 cause issues. Current topology: triangular main truss with nodes on baseline (0,0),(6,0),(2,0) and one top node (2.55, 2.4). Existing nodes at load and supports can\'t change.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_5 too thin (area_id=1) yet highly stressed - increasing area to reduce stress would increase mass, maybe add bracing or redistribute forces by topology. Member_4 also stressed (-17.37) slightly out of bound.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node higher and slightly right from current node_5 at around (3.4, 3.1) to better distribute load. Connect this new node_6 to nodes: node_1, node_5, node_3, node_2 to form a truss diamond with two top nodes improving load path, aim to reduce stresses. Upgrade cross section selectively, biggest area to members most stressed.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_6 above and to right redistributes force with more triangles, improving stiffness and lowering peak stress. Maintain pinned and roller; cannot move load/support points as per constraints. Use larger areas on crucial tension/compression chords near supports, smaller elsewhere to keep mass low.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check length of new members, forces in members by method of joints or basic force idea: shorter members + proper cross-section area reduce stress.
