Current design has max stress 12 (good) but mass 53 (too heavy). Areas too large or member lengths too long causing excess mass.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Mass is excessive due to 3 heavy members (member_3 with area 4 and long length, member_9 area 4 and long length, member_7 area 3 with lengthy members). Installation of node_6 adds complexity and mass without significant stress reduction benefit. Load at node_3 with magnitude 10 downward at 45° suggests an optimal simple truss with well distributed members near node_3 under tension/compression. Crucial nodes 1 and 2 as pinned and roller supports must remain as is. Members connecting node_3 to base and upper node should be revised.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider reducing number of nodes; keep nodes at support and load only (+ add minimal nodes). Replace large area members with smaller area ones if stress permissible. Try classic triangular truss 3 nodes forming a triangle with node_3 elevated so to better distribute forces. Possibly keep node_5 close to node_3 to create a stable short upper chord and minimize member sizes/masses.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_6 to reduce mass. Move node_5 closer vertically centered above node_3 at moderate height ~2. Use members: node_1-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_5-node_3, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, selecting areas smaller or equal 3. Select area sizes to maintain stress <15 and mass <30. Minimal 5 members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Reduce mass by removing less critical nodes and members; shorter members, smaller areas suffice since stress in initial design below 15. Minimize redundancy. The truss forms a stable triangle between node_1, node_2 and node_5 with stiff diagonal and chord members. Horizontal base tied with member_4 and node_3 connected ensuring load transfer. All under max stress 15 and mass ~28-30.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths calculated by distance formula; areas chosen balanced so stresses close to but below 15 abs. Moderate height of node_5 keeps diagonal length low, preserving mass. Use low/moderate area for members near compression zones.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node positions: node_5 placed at (2.6, 2.1) above node_3 (2, 0).
