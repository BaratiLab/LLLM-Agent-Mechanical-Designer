Member_5 (node_3-node_2) area is high (4), causing high mass. Current member layout lacks triangulation between load and supports, inducing bending and high stress. Node_4 shifted right (3.2,1.8) in last iteration but stress still too high; redesign needed including additional nodes to better transfer loads and reduce member forces and stress.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Add node above or near load for triangulation, implement tension-compression path. Avoid direct long members with high stress. Use areas ≤3 for lower mass. Target max member stress ≤15 both tension/compression.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Add additional node above node_3 around x=2.5, y=2.4 for load redistribution. Maintain existing supports node_1 (0,0) pinned and node_2 (6,0) roller unchanged. Create triangular frame: members from node_1 to new node and new node to nodes 2 & 3. Use areas around 2-3 for moderate load members, and smaller areas 1 for less stressed corresponding members. Remove stressed member_4 and replace by triangulated members. Assign finite designed areas meeting constraints.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangulation reduces bending moments and distributes stress more uniformly. Adding a vertical node near load transfers force via two paths, reducing stress on any single member. Using moderate cross-sectional areas maintains mass under limit but sufficient to keep stresses within allowed range. Member_4 is problematic, replacing it by 2 members sharing load will reduce peak tensile stress. Avoid overly large areas to satisfy mass constraint.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Node_1: (0.0,0.0), node_2: (6.0,0.0), node_3: (2.0,0.0) fixed. Add node_5: (2.55,2.4).
