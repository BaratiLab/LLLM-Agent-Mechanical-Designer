  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to satisfy max stress ±15 and max mass 30 with given loads and supports.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current total mass 35.65 > 30 limit; max stress 12.81 compliant. Need mass reduction primarily; stress allowable.",
  
  "analysis": "Load at node_3 downward-left (-10 N, -45°). Supports pinned at node_1 (0,0), roller at node_2 (6,0). Current structure uses 5 free nodes with members sized 2-4. Current oversized mass mainly from heavy members_6 (area_id=4) and members_1,2 with large area. To reduce mass, remove longest/heavily loaded members and reduce area. Rearrange vertical and diagonal support with optimized node placements to reduce length and cross-sectional demand.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove member_6 (node_3-node_2), replace with node near midpoint to redistribute load; reduce area sizes to 2 or lower; adjust node_11 to lower y for less displacement and material; forget member from node_1-node_3 directly for optimized triangulated frame. Use fewer members with moderate areas. Keep given support/load nodes fixed; add a node around (3.5,1.8).",
  
  "proposal": "Use nodes: node_1(0.0,0.0), node_2(6.0,0.0), node_3(2.0,0.0), add node_12(3.5,1.7) to stabilize. Members: node_1-node_3(A=2), node_3-node_2(A=3), node_1-node_12(A=2), node_12-node_2(A=2), node_12-node_3(A=3). Redesigned triangulated net with smaller areas balanced to reduce mass <30, stresses under ±15.",
  
  "reasoning": "Triangular topology ensures stiffness and redundancy. Reduced largest area components and member length. Distributing load through mid-span node reduces bending and compressive demand on node_3-node_2 member. Moderate cross-section sizes to maintain stress within limits using force distribution ratio and length. Nodes set for balance between member length(minimizing mass length*area) and structural strength.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: m1 (node1-node3): 2.0 m; m2 (node3-node2): 4.0 m; m3(node1-node12): sqrt((3.5)²+(1.7)²)=3.87 m; m4(node12-node2)=sqrt((2.5)²+(1.7)²)=3.0 m; m5(node12-node3)=1.5 m. Choose area ids: 2 (0.782), 3(1.759), 3(1.759), 2(0.782), 3(1.759). Estimated mass ~ sum(length*area): 2*0.782=1.564 + 4*1.759=7.036 + 3.87*0.782=~3.03 +3*0.782=2.346 +1.5*1.759=2.6395 Total ≈16.615kg well under max mass 30. Expect all stresses under 15 given load distribution reduction.",
  
  "calculation": "Validated approximate total mass 16.6 <30, max stress anticipated well under 15 given good triangulation and lowered demands. Redesigned for shortest needed length members with reasonable area.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Kept all constraints: supports/place unchanged for nodes_1,2,3; added node_12; removed prior heavy large-area members; arranged triangulation; areas selected from allowed; no duplicate members or nodes. Expected final mass and stresses within limits.",
