Current max stress 42.34 > 15, mass 20.29 < 30 good. Optimize topology and member areas to reduce stress.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure over-stressed mainly member_6 (node_3-node_2) 42.34 and mass is ok. The load is at node_3 (-10, -45°). Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Main tensile stress at member_6 suggests it carries excessive load without good load path.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Member_6 highly stressed in tension. Connector nodes like node_5 and node_6 attempted earlier but with higher mass and no stress relief. Need to add intermediate node higher above node_3 to redistribute forces.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Add one intermediate node ~above node_3 (to form a stable triangular truss with nodes 1,3, and 2). Reconfigure members linking it to node_3, node_1 and node_2. Use carefully chosen areas all ≤3 (to keep mass controlled). Remove poorly performing members causing stress concentration.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangular configurations help stabilize and redistribute longitudinal and shear stresses. Adding one carefully placed node vertically up from node_3 allows shorter members to nodes 1 and 2, improving load path. Smaller area members reduce mass; highly stressed member will get a larger area but below 3 to keep mass low. Eliminate direct members with extreme stress while ensuring statically determined truss with pinned/roller supports.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Derived node_7: x=2.0, y=3.5; members: node_1-node_7, node_7-node_3, node_7-node_2, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_1.

Mass ≈ sum length*area: 4.031*0.195 + 0.5*1.75 + 5.315*1.75 +4*0.78 +2*0.78 +6*0.195 =0.79+0.875+9.31+3.12+1.56+1.17=16.82<30.
