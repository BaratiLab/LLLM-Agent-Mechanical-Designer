Nodes_1,2 - supports fixed. Move node_8 from (3.1,2.9) to approx (2.7, 2.6) to reduce length and angle of member_4 to reduce stress. Assign member areas as: reduce members 1,2 to area 2 (1.759), member_4 area 4 (3.128) to handle tension, others remain area 3 (1.759) or tweak to reduce mass and stress.
