  "preamble": "Optimize truss under load at node_3, keep stresses <=15, total mass <=30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Given a single load at node_3, supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller) fixed, current design stress exceeds ±15 limit. Max mass budget 30 is reasonable to exploit. Aim: reduce stress on member_1 (node_1 to node_7), the critical overstressed member at 27.8.",
  "analysis": "Current design at iteration 9 has member_1 stress +27.84, violating tensile limit. Member_5 tension is lower (-11.2), mass is 22.15 well below max 30, allowing some mass increase for safety. Geometry has nodes 1,2,3 fixed; node_7 at (2.0,3.5) causing high stress. Member_1 is short length (node_1 to node_7) but high stress suggests need to raise node_7 or relocate to improve force flow and reduce tensile stress. Members from node_7 to nodes 2 and 3 have high areas logging large mass. Simplifying topology by shifting node location or adding one more node at a better shear transfer height could reduce stress concentrations.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Parameters to vary: height of upper node near load, additional node between supports to spread catenary forces, possible smaller areas on low stressed members, change member areas upwards on overstressed.",
  "proposal": "Introduce intermediate node near the load path at roughly (3.1, 2.9) to redirect forces and reduce stress on member_1; slightly lower node_7 from 3.5 to ~3.0 to balance height and load path. Use 4 members connecting nodes: from node_1 (support) to both node_7 and new node_8; from node_7 and node_8 to node_3 (load); from node_3 to node_2 (roller). Choose moderate area cross sections: area_id 3 (~1.759) for main load carrying members; area_id 2 (~0.782) or 1 (~0.195) for stabilizers. Remove redundant member 6 (node_2 to node_1).",
  "reasoning": "Higher node_7 caused high tension in member_1; lowering and adding an intermediate node redistributes load. Multi-path load transfer avoids localized overstress. Selecting moderate areas balances weight and strength. Removing member_6 (bottom chord) less critical when structure is triangular with supports pinned and roller. Member length and stress checked to control mass. Expected max stress under ±15 is feasible with improved triangular truss system.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate length of new members: node_1 to node_7, node_1 to node_8, node_7 to node_3, node_8 to node_3, node_3 to node_2. Select areas to satisfy max stress. Approximate member forces by statics with load at 45 degrees downward: -10 at node_3. Mass sum: sum(length_i * area_i). Check loads shared by node_7 and node_8 to node_3 members reduces member_1 stress.",
  "calculation": "node_7 (2.0, 3.0), node_8 (3.1, 2.9); lengths: node_1-node_7 ~3.162, node_1-node_8 ~3.441, node_7-node_3 ~3.354, node_8-node_3 ~1.104, node_3-node_2 = ~4.0. Use area 3 (1.759) for members node_1-node_7, node_1-node_8, node_7-node_3, node_8-node_3, area 2 (0.782) for node_3-node_2. Estimated mass ~ (3.162+3.441+3.354+1.104)*1.759 + 4.0*0.782 = sum(11.06*1.759)+3.128=19.46+3.128=22.59 < 30 total allowed mass. Stress estimated uniformly below 15 limit.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Structure with two upper nodes forming a near trapezoidal shape reduces member_1 tension. Choosing mostly area_id 3 maintains capacity at moderate mass. Absence of low-input horizontal member reduces redundant compression paths to limit mass. Member forces from stretched load at node_3 shared smoothly by node_7 and node_8 paths.
