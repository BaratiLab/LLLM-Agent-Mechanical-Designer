Load is at node_3 (-10 N at -45°). Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Existing design is too heavy and overstressed, particularly members connected to node_6.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current structure is too redundant and heavy with oversized area assignments and inefficient internal nodes (especially node_6). Stress concentration on members connected to node_6 indicates forced load transfer causing overstress and high mass. Also, some members likely not critical and adding mass. Load applied at node_3 low on x-axis requires a truss configuration optimally transferring it to supports on node_1 and node_2.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Consider removing node_6 to reduce complexity and mass. Reorient or move node_5 upward and create a simpler triangulated truss leveraging minimal members with appropriate area sizes. Smaller area members in compression, larger in tension sparingly. Avoid direct load carriers with heavy cross members.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Remove node_6. Maintain supported nodes node_1 and node_2 at base. Strengthen load transfer from node_3 to supports via upper nodes redistribution by adjusting node_4 and node_5 placement. Use node_4 at midpoint on x~3.0 and y~3.5, node_5 at roughly (3.0, 5.0). Connect members: base (node_1-node_2), triangular bracing (node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4), vertical node_3 to node_4, upper diagonal nodes (node_4-node_5), and direct load node_3 to node_5. Assign areas conservatively as per stress (main compression links thicker, others thinner).",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Removing node_6 simplifies load paths, reduces member numbers and masses. Positioning node_4 centrally at 3.0, 3.5 optimizes load distribution symmetrical about central load node_3 at 2.0, 0.0. Using a triangular arrangement provides structural stability under vertical and angled loading. Assign area sizes: tension members larger to handle tensile stresses, compression smaller to save mass but strong enough to maintain stress within ±15 constraint.
