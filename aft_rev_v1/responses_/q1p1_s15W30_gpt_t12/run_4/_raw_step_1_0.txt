Max stress in some members exceeds ±15 limit, especially member_5 at 27.84. Total mass 17.36 < 30 is acceptable. Redesign needed to reduce member_5 stress by structural rearrangement and area resizing.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current design overstresses member_5, likely due to direct diagonal loading and insufficient triangulation in lower chord. Members_5,6 connecting top node_4 to supports carry large forces. Current node_4 location and members directly link supports and applied load node_3, but member sizes too small to resist forces safely under ±15 stress limit. The total mass is acceptable but members need stress reduction mainly in tension or compression.", \n    "scratch_pad_2": "Strong redundant triangulation in load path needed. Add a new node above node_3 to create multiple load paths and better distribute load. Consider adjusting member sizes using area categories to balance stresses below ±15, probably larger areas along primary load path, smaller elsewhere. Maintain constraints on node_1, node_2, node_3 position.",\n\n    "proposal": "Add one intermediate top node \'node_5\' above and centered near node_3 (x=3.0, y=5.0), creating two inclined members toward this node from nodes 1 & 2, replacing or complementing member_5 and member_6. Also keep node_4 as an intermediary lower top chord to form a planar quadrilateral with diagonal bracing between node_4 and node_5. Connect node_3 to node_4 and node_5 to distribute load path. Reduce area for members under less stress and increase area cautiously along main load paths to meet ±15 stress limit.",\n\n    "reasoning": "By adding node_5 above node_3, load from node_3 can distributing into members (node_3-node_5), (node_5-node_1), and (node_5-node_2), reducing stress in (node_1-node_4) and (node_2-node_4) and eliminating high stress in member_5. This reduces large tension in member_5 and members near top node_4. Areas are adjusted using inputs \'0\' to \'10\' where \'0\' =1 and \'1\'=0.195 etc. Moderate to high areas around 5-7 for principal members; low areas ~1 or 2 for others. Supports remain pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 to keep statical determinate and adequate reaction support.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "New nodes: node_5: (3.0,5.0).
