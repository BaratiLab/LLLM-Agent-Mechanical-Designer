Supports at node_1 and node_2. Prior designs show high member stresses up to 443 and mass 45. Maximizing truss efficiency requires reducing stresses and mass simultaneously, choosing smaller cross-sections and better force paths.",\n    "analysis": "Current design iteration15 has multiple highly overstressed members (member_5,6 with 443 stress) exceeding the ±15 stress allowable, total mass 45.9 over budget of 30. Areas are large (2 and 4 mainly). Force flows cause some members to carry extreme loads due to suboptimal connectivity. The load being off-center at node_3 needs a strong load path and lateral bracing. Current geometry likely induces large bending or isolated force concentration.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce cross-section areas of overstressed members and add triangulation to better distribute loads, especially around node_3. Consider removing redundant/massive members with no effective load transfer role. Adjust nodes 6 and 7 or remove one to improve load transfer with simpler triangulation. Aim a classic triangular truss with supporting nodes 1,2 base, node_3 loaded, and two additional nodes to distribute load and keep low mass and stresses within ratio constraints.",\n    "proposal": "Propose 2 new internal nodes between nodes_3 and node_5 vicinity to form robust triangular paths. Keep node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Simplify members and assign smaller areas to minimize mass but sufficient to keep stress ≤15. New nodes around (2.5, 2.5) and (3.5, 3.5) to allow triangulation. Members connecting (1-3), (2-3), (3-new1), (3-new2), (new1-new2), (new1-5), (new2-5), (1-new1), (2-new2). Use only areas 1, 2, or 3 to reduce total mass under 30.",\n    "reasoning": "By concentrating on triangulated paths we share load from node_3 to supports 1 and 2 via two intermediate nodes, avoiding few members carrying large stresses. Triangulation keeps structure statically determinate and stable. The shorter the members, smaller cross-sections needed which lowers mass. Assign lowest areas (1 or 2) on longer members and a moderate (3) for main load paths. Load angle at 45° downward means both horizontal and vertical force components distributed through internal nodes. This layout relieves high stress members and keeps total mass below 30.",\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths: member_1: node1–node3 ~2m; node3–new1 ~ approx 2.0; node3–new2 ~~2.0; new1–new2 ~~1.4; new1–node5 ~~1.8; new2–node5 ~~1.8; node1–new1 ~~2.5; node2–new2 ~ ~2.8; and node2–node3 ~4 allowed or skip to reduce mass. Cross sections selected circumscribe total mass <= 30kg while stress magnitude capped at 15. Approx mass calculation based on length × area factor shows cumulated mass under limit.",\n    "calculation": "Sum lengths*area: member_1 (2m *3.128=6.3), member_2 (node1-new1 2.5m*0.782=1.95), member_3 (node3-new1 2m*1.759=3.5), member_4 (node3-new2 2m*1.759=3.5), member_5 (new1-new2 1.4m*0.782=1.09), member_6 (new1-node5 1.8m*0.195=0.35), member_7 (new2-node5 1.8m*0.195=0.35), member_8 (node2-new2 2.8m*0.782=2.19), member_9 (node2-node3 4m*0.195=0.78).
