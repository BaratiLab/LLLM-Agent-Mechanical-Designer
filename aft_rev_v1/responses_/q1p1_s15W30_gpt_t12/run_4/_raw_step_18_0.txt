Previous design overstress mainly member_5. Mass is well under the max limit permitting stronger members if needed.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current max stress member_5 is 39.07 exceeding stress limits. Other members stress upper bound acceptable. Mass currently 15.356 well below 30. Nodes mostly fixed except slight repositioning for optimization is allowed except load and supports. The main stress is concentrated at the diagonal member_5 (node_4-node_6) with min area 1 causing overstress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing area selectively on critical members can relieve stress. Slight node reposition can improve load path. Adding a new intermediate node can introduce alternate load paths or bracing for stress redistribution. A triangular or butterfly-type bracing pattern between nodes 3,4,5,6 might balance loads.",\n\n  "proposal": "Remove the small low-area diagonal \'member_5\' (node_4-node_6) to reduce overstress there. Insert a new node \'node_7\' near (3.0, 3.0) for improving load transfer. Connect node_3, node_4, node_6, node_7, and node_5 with members. Increase areas strategically on these members to keep max stress under ±15. Re-assign areas from smallest to moderate to reduce mass. Maintain all loads and previous supports.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_5 overstressed likely because small cross-sectional area and high force transfer on diagonal. Introducing node_7 allows extra triangulation improving stiffness and load distribution, reducing overload on member_5. Selecting intermediate to low areas on the same and other critical members help reduce stress. The addition of node_7 generates additional members that can share load, reducing max stress. Node movement restricted for load and supports but internal nodes fine to relocate. Strategic openings to limit member length and keeping mass under constraint by careful area selection.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_7 addition: position to split the diagonal between node_4 and node_6. Members connecting (3,4), (4,7), (7,6), (7,5). Assign areas to not exceed stress limits of ±15. Lengths need recalculation and mass summing. Test maximum stress limit robustly.",\n\n  "calculation": "1) Calculate member lengths: \\n - node_4-node_7 length ~ sqrt((3.0-2.75)^2+(3.0-2.5)^2)=~0.559 \\n - node_7-node_6 length ~ sqrt((3.2-3.0)^2+(2.95-3.0)^2)=~0.206 \\n2) Potential members : [\'1\',\'2\',\'3\'] areas allowed with masses favoring low area but strength needed.\\n3) Assign member areas: \\n  - Members with lower force: area \'1\' or \'2\' \\n  - Members with higher force: area \'3\' or \'4\' as limit permits \\n4) Assemble total mass from member lengths × areas \\n5) Estimate stress using cross section and member configuration assuming force redistributions.\\n6) Ensure max stress < 15 and total mass <30.", \n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Nodes fixed: node_1,2,3,4,5,6.
