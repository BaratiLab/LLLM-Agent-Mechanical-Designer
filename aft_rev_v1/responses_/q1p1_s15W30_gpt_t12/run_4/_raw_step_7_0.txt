Supports pinned at node1 and roller at node2. Current mass 66.46 exceeds max 30, max stress is safe at 5.29. Need to reduce big mass by downsizing areas and revising topology. Existing nodes at load/support fixed. Can move others.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current design heavily over mass constraint but stresses are well below limits, indicating members larger than needed. Node_6 positioned inside (2.3,1.3) adding complexity via 4 members, total mass from large areas (4,5) makes structure heavy. Basic reason for large mass: multiple long heavy members with large cross sections. History shows struggle balancing mass and stress with complex nodes like node_6 and node_7. Missing triangulation in lower region around node_3 causes more force on few members increasing their required sections. Direct load path with stable triangle is key to reduce sizing and mass. Load at node_3 suggests need for additional bracing and redistribution.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Ideas: Reduce internal nodes (node_6), remove or relocate them. Create a planar triangular design with main load support path. Keep simple triangular bracing between node_1, node_2, and node_3+node_4 / node_5 without overly heavy members. Use smaller area sizes mostly 1 or 2, maximal 3 only where necessary to keep stress below 15. Try slightly raise node_5 (current 3,5 to 4.5 to elongate force path) to distribute force paths. Add diagonal member between load node_3 and top node_4 to form stable triangular planes with pinned and roller supports.",\n\n    "proposal": "Remove node_6. Slightly raise node_4 to 3.0, node_5 raised to 4.5 for longer force path. Connect node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4, node_5 with six members to form four triangles for stable load distribution: (\'node_1\',\'node_3\'), (\'node_2\',\'node_3\'), (\'node_3\',\'node_4\'), (\'node_4\',\'node_5\'), (\'node_1\',\'node_4\'), (\'node_2\',\'node_5\'). Areas assigned with 1 and 2 only. Assign larger areas close to supports and vertical compression members. A small area for top ties and diagonal to reduce mass. This keeps stresses ≤ 15 max, total estimated mass ≤ 30.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Removing node_6 simplifies design, removing heavy mid-level bracing which contributed to large mass. Raising top nodes lengthens compression/tension paths and distributes stresses evenly. Using mostly small area indexes from available set reduces mass significantly. Triangular connections provide stability under load angle (-45°). Using only existing defined nodes except for position adjustment within rules for non-load/support nodes. Load path directly from node_3 at 2.0,0.0 through diagonal to node_4 (3.0,3.0) and node_5 (3.0,4.5) transfers load upwards, balanced by supports at node_1 (0,0) pinned and node_2 (6,0) roller. Member selection limits mass and ensures stress ≤ 15 per code due to shorter members and lower area values.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Use member lengths: node_1-node_3: 2.0,0; node_3-node_4 approx sqrt((3-2)^2 + (3-0)^2)=~3.16; node_4-node_5 1.5 vertical; node_1-node_4 ~ sqrt(3^2+3^2)=4.24; node_2-node_3: 4.0 horiz to 2.0,0; node_2-node_5 ~ sqrt(6-3)^2+(4.5-0)^2)= ~5.3\\nAreas : assign 2 (0.782) to main compression members (e.g. node_1-node_3), 1 (0.195) or 0 (1.0) for less force.
