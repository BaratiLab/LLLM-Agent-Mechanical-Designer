Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Current max stress 68.76 exceeding ±15, mass 28.9 near limit 30. Need better stress distribution, smaller areas where possible, reprioritize members under high tension/compression.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current design has over-stressed members 8 and 10 with high tensile and compressive stress far exceeding limits. Member 10 especially -68.76 exceeds allowable by >4x. Mass is safe but not minimal. The top chord and verticals create stress risers under eccentric loading at node_3. Members around node_5 and node_6 show stresses also above limit, indicating load paths concentrating stresses poorly. The triangular arrangement near node_4-node_7 is efficient but areas are too large in some members leading to excess mass and stress. Revising node_7 to redistribute forces; Member 10 carries considerable compressive stress which can be reduced by improving load path via changed diagonal bracing.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress, consider relocating node_7 slightly lower and closer to node_3 to reduce member_10 load. Decrease areas of members with stress below limits. Use higher area IDs on members carrying higher stress but reduce them if they are excessively stressed and susceptible to buckling. Reduce member length by careful node placement. Introduce an additional nodal support brace to divide forces and reduce stress concentration.",\n\n  "proposal": "Maintain existing nodes 1, 2, 3; adjust node_4, node_5, node_6, node_7 positions for better load path. Add node_8 near node_4 and node_5 to create additional bracing. Adjust areas to keep mass under 30. Connect with members providing necessary triangulation to reduce max stress to ≤±15. Member areas assigned carefully based on estimated stress levels from analysis. Remove member with excessively high stress and replace load path through few well-sized members.",\n\n  "reasoning": "High tensile/compressive stress concentrated on member_10 and 8 due to eccentric load at node_3. Introducing new diagonal supports reduces bending effect by converting it to axial stress within allowable range. Smaller, well-placed nodal supports redistribute loads allowing member areas reduction. Placing nodes strategically near mid-span aligns forces along members, reducing bending moment and stress. Adjusting cross-sectional areas with higher IDs increases load capacity without much mass penalty due to shorter members. Removing redundant or excessively stressed members helps improve global behavior.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check length and force distribution in each member based on new nodal layout. Estimate member forces using approximate method: consider force vector at node_3 split between main top and bottom chords relieved via intermediate nodes. Use stress = force / (area * allowable stress). Total mass approx sum(length_i * area_i * unit_density). Assign areas to meet max ±15 stress constraint. Node positions chosen to decrease moment distance to load application.",\n\n  "calculation": "1. Lengths approximation: keep base 6m between nodes 1-2, node_3 at (2,0). Slider node_2 at x=6,y=0 pinned_centre. 2. Place node_4 at (2.9,3.1) pretty close but slightly lower to reduce leverage 3. Place node_5 at (3.5,2.8) lowering and closer to node_4 to reduce excessive member length 4. Place node_6 at (4.1,1.7) flatter top chord 5. Slight relocate node_7 to (3.25,2.0) reduces length/forces on member_10 6. Add node_8 at (2.7,2.0) between node_4, node_5 to brace central area 7. Replace members: main chords resized to area ID 2 (0.782), new diagonals area ID 1 (0.195), verticals rattressing area ID 3 (1.759) 8. Removed member_10 carrying peak compressive stress - gaps replaced with triangulation via node_8 9. Approximate mass improved with fewer heavily stressed and shorter members 10. Member stresses estimated to be < ±15 by distributing load effectively.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Check each member: lengths, areas product max stress under 15 threshold. Total mass from length × area sum <30. All connections unique. Nodes not moved except allowed (preserving 1,2,3). Areas only from allowed dictionary values.
