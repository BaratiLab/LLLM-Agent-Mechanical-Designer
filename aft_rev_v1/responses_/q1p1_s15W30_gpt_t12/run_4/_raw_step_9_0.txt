Max stress must be ≤ ±15, current max is 88.58 (too large). Max mass 30, current 24.26 is ok. Node_3 is a key load point. Current members overstressed, especially members joining node_6 to node_5 and node_3. Existing structure has 6 nodes, 8 members. Need better load transfer and reduced member stress by rearranging members and node_6 position.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current iteration moderately light mass but excessive stress on members near loaded node_3 and node_6\'s connections. Members connecting node_3-node_6 and node_6-node_5 are overloaded. Node_6 assists load distribution but location and member sizing inadequate. Member areas are assigned, but several have high stress. Adding a new node or adjusting layout to form stable triangulated substructures and shorter high-stress members can reduce stress. Current direct member from node_2 to node_5 is large area but still unstable. Members \'member_7\' and \'member_6\' are zero stress possibly redundant. Need better distributed load paths. Consider relocating node_6 higher and/or repositioning node_5 to optimize force flow.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce length and area of highly stressed member_5. Form stable triangles around load. Consider adding a new node between node_3 and node_5 to share loads. Maintain fixed nodes 1, 2, 3. Use area ids no bigger than 4 to not increase mass excessively. Possibly reduce member lengths from node_6 and node_5 to node_4 to improve stiffness distribution.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_7 above node_6 (e.g., around (2.8,3.0)) to create a truss web. Connect node_3, node_6, node_7, node_5, and node_4 with triangulations. Remove or rename existing overload members where needed. Assign areas mainly between 1 to 4 for material saving. Use stiff members from pinned and roller supports (node_1, node_2) to key load sharing nodes. Optimal node placements ensure shorter, properly triangulated members. Proposed connections: node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, node_3-node_7, node_7-node_5, node_7-node_6, node_6-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_1-node_6, node_2-node_5.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangulated substructures close loads path and reduce member lengths. Adding node_7 shares load paths and limits long tension/compression members. Mobile node_6 is raised to improve vertical load path. Smaller members closer to support critial to reducing high tensile/compressive stress. Material areas allocated based on member length and expected load path, keeping mass ≤30.
