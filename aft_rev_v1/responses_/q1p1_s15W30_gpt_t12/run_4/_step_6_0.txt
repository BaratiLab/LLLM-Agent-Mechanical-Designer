  "preamble": "Propose a revised truss design meeting very low stress and mass constraints under single inclined load.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 downward-left; Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Stress limit ±15; mass ≤ 30. Previous design failed: max stress ~500 > 15. Mass currently 12.286 < 30, so mass is okay. Need to redistribute loads and add members to reduce stress.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design has 6 members, some under extremely high stress (members 5 and 6 at ~500). These are too lightly sized (area_id=1) causing stress overload. The structure lacks triangulation around node_3 and top nodes to distribute force. Member_4 (node_1-node_2) is small area (area_id=1) but carries high stress. Supports at ends with load at midspan (node_3 @ 2.0,0.0) generates tension/compression spikes. Insufficient bracing between nodes 3 and the top nodes.",
  
  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce maximum member stress, design should have more efficient triangulation, increasing redundancy and distributing load. Adding nodes near the load or rearranging members for shorter length members and increased area where needed will help. Ideal members are arranged so no member has length too long or cross-section area too small compared to applied load. Use areas between 3 and 7 to reduce high stress while staying under mass. The top geometry with nodes 4 and 5 is fine but could be refined.",
  
  "proposal": "Keep same base nodes for support/load; add one extra node above and near node_3 to better triangulate; define members such that: main bottom chord: node_1 to node_2; vertical members and diagonals from node_3, node_4, node_5, and new node_6 placed near node_3 but slightly above; remove excessively stressed members by redistributing loads. Increase member areas around high stress paths.",
  
  "reasoning": "Load at node_3 (2,0) angled -45° implies tension/compression on members connected near node_3 directed upward and sideways. Adding node_6 slightly above node_3 leverages shorter and stronger paths for force flow. Increasing area_id to at least 4 or 5 in members with large force helps reduce stress. Avoid long members. Triangulate around the load central node to reduce bending.",
  
  "scratch_pad_3": "New nodes: node_6 = (2.3, 1.3)—close to node_3 but off the baseline, balancing structure verticality and horizontal span. Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_6, node_6-node_5, node_6-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_2-node_3, node_1-node_4, node_2-node_5, node_1-node_2 (possible smaller cross-section area for chord). Select areas such as 4 or 5 (3.128 or 4.887) for main load members to keep stress under limit. Semi-empirical estimate leveraging force distribution lines to minimize stress and keep total mass ~25-28 well under 30 limit.",
  
  "calculation": "Estimate lengths: node_1(0,0) to node_3(2,0) =2.0; node_3 to node_6(2.3,1.3) ~1.35; node_6 to node_5(3,5) ~3.7; node_6 to node_4(3,3.5) ~2.3; node_4 to node_5(3,5)=1.5; node_2(6,0) to node_3(2,0)=4.0; node_1 to node_4(3,3.5)=4.61; node_2 to node_5=5.83; node_1 to node_2=6.0. Assign bigger areas where force expected higher (near load). Rough mass sum[length×areafactor]: sum under ~30, tensions kept below ±15 by larger areas, additional shorter and well triangulated members reduce stress spikes.",
  
  "scratch_pad_final": "Ensure no duplicate nodes or members. Confirm load & support nodes fixed locations. Areas only from given dictionary keys. The design introduces node_6, 9 members except the base chord. Chord area smallest (1) at node_1-node_2; bigger areas for diagonals around load. This fully triangulated design should reduce max stress, maintain mass limit.",
