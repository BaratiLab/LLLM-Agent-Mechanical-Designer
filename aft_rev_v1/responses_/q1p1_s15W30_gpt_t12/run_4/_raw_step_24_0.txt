Supports are fixed and roller on node_1 and node_2 base respectively. Constraints: max stress in members ±15 and total mass ≤ 30. Current structure too stressed (max ~34.9). Strategy is redesign for lower stress concentration and balanced force paths.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress violation in member_4 (-34.88) compressive and others near limit. Mass (17.82) is below limit but stress mostly exceeds. Nodes 4,5,6,7,8 arranged near load causing stress concentration on short receive members. Load is eccentric on node_3 resulting in high tensile and compressive forces. Current design uses mostly small area members (1 and 2), some 3, 0 used on chord. Need better load transfer and force distribution to avoid single members bearing high force.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Use multiple shorter members to spread forces. Increase cross-sectional areas on highest load paths. Remove unnecessary small members causing redundancy. Placement of intermediate nodes to create stable triangles and reduce bending/moment effects.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Redesign structure with nodes: keep nodes 1,2,3 fixed in position. Remove unnecessary nodes 7 and 8 to simplify. Adjust node_4 position closer to line between node_3 and 5 for optimized load path. Add single intermediate node_5 near (3.0,3.0). Members: create triangular and braced truss with members connecting supports to load and intermediate nodes. Use higher areas near supports and load nodes to reduce stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "To reduce max stress, triangulate truss with direct force paths from load to supports. Avoid small-length high-stress members by appropriate node placement. Larger areas on key members reduce stress without much mass penalty. Simplifying node layout aids stable force transfer. Member numbering sequential for clarity.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Key nodes fixed: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0). Add node_4 at (2.7,2.7), node_5 at (4.0,2.5).

Approximate areas: members with highest forces use area_id=3 (1.759), others use 1 (0.195) or 2 (0.782).
