Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Existing design exceeded stress limit on member_7 (32.64 > 15). Mass 21.04 < limit 30. Need to reduce member_7 stress.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Excessive tensile stress (32.64) in member_7 (node_1-node_4) suggests load path concentration. Members with small areas near load have high stresses. Member_7 area = 1 (0.195) minimal; increasing area raises mass. Mass budget available (21~30). Possibly better to redistribute load path with node additions or optimize member connections in truss top section reducing load stress in member_7.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Adding intermediate node near load & supports to redistribute forces. Strengthen currently high stress paths with moderate area. Consider triangle layouts for stability. Remove low-stress members. Node_6 at (2.3, 2.1) can move slightly upward to better triangulate. Add new node higher or near load, to add connect members relieving tensile stress in member_7.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node_7 near load at (2.8, 3.5) to help distribute stresses. Redefine members to create triangulated path from supports to load node via nodes 6 and 7. Increase area for critical members to moderate levels from area map. Use areas 3 to 5 for high stress members, smaller 1-2 for supports/mild loads. Revise member connections for relevant triangulation and load transfer from node_3 to node_4/node_7 then supports.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "By introducing node_7 vertically offset near the load, creating triangulation between node_3, node_6 and node_7 splits load path into multibranched forces reducing stress concentration in member_7. Increasing cross-sectional areas for primary members alleviates stress. Prioritize stiffer upper truss members to carry load. The total mass must stay under 30, so carefully size large areas only on critical members to balance stress and mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Nodes fixed: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0). Support constraint preserved. Added node_7 (2.8, 3.5).
