Fail constraints. High mass mainly from members 5,6 area \'3\' (6.976, 6.612). Stress peak at member_1 ties at node_1 and node_3 close to -15.9. Loads and supports fixed. Current design dense around mid-upper nodes 6,7 redundant, adding weight without stress relief. We can remove or reposition nodes 6,7 and rethink members to reduce mass and keep stress within range by lowering high areas and lengths.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on main load path and pin support equilibrium. Use fewer nodes for member length control. Employ smaller area members except where needed for transfer of large loads at lower locations. Drop or merge nodes 6,7 with 4 or 5 to simplify frame with fewer long heavy members.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_6 and node_7. Introduce single diagonal brace from node_3 to node_5 (high point). Add direct bracing between node_1-node_5 and node_2-node_5 for triangular stiff frame. Use areas 2 or 3 for main connectors under load, reduce redundant member areas to 1 or 0 for light elements. Balanced triangular structure with three support nodes (node_1 pinned, node_2 roller, node_5 apex) supports load with minimal mass and controlled stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Reducing node count lowers complexity and mass. Diagonal elements absorb shear forces minimizing member length and area. The load at node_3 is transferred as compression/ tension in short members coupling nodes_1, 2, and 5. Choosing area IDs carefully around 2 or 3 but avoiding high areas reduces mass but ensures stress <= ±15. Balanced triangular form offers good stability and stress distribution. With removal of intermediate nodes eliminates unnecessary member mass under load case.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths: node_1 to node_5 approx 5.8 m, node_2 to node_5 approx 3.2 m diagonal, node_3 to node_5 approx 5.0 m. Selecting moderate area 2 (0.782) or area 1 (0.195) gives member mass length*area approx within allowable total mass if limited to 5 members.

Members: node_1-node_5 length sqrt(3^2 +5^2)=5.83 m area 3.128(approx 3)(area id 2)=5.83*0.782=4.56 mass. node_2-node_5 length sqrt(3^2+5^2)=~5.83 m dab. ~4.5 mass area 2 same approx. node_3-node_5 length sqrt(1^2 +5^2)=~5.1 m area 1(0.195)= ~1 mass. node_1-node_2 length 6m area 1 or 0 (0.195 or 1)=1.2 or 6 mass depending area. Total mass sum near or below 30 with areas chosen as 2(0.782) mainly, limited areas to reduce mass. Biggest force likely shared between node_2-node_5 and node_1-node_5 compression/tension; node_3-node_5 transfer load lightly so smaller area.
