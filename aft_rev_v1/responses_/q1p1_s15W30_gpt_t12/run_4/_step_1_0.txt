    "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss under given load/supports, limit stress to ±15 and mass ≤30.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 is -10 N at -45°, supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Max stress in some members exceeds ±15 limit, especially member_5 at 27.84. Total mass 17.36 < 30 is acceptable. Redesign needed to reduce member_5 stress by structural rearrangement and area resizing.",

    "analysis": "Current design overstresses member_5, likely due to direct diagonal loading and insufficient triangulation in lower chord. Members_5,6 connecting top node_4 to supports carry large forces. Current node_4 location and members directly link supports and applied load node_3, but member sizes too small to resist forces safely under ±15 stress limit. The total mass is acceptable but members need stress reduction mainly in tension or compression.", 
    "scratch_pad_2": "Strong redundant triangulation in load path needed. Add a new node above node_3 to create multiple load paths and better distribute load. Consider adjusting member sizes using area categories to balance stresses below ±15, probably larger areas along primary load path, smaller elsewhere. Maintain constraints on node_1, node_2, node_3 position.",

    "proposal": "Add one intermediate top node 'node_5' above and centered near node_3 (x=3.0, y=5.0), creating two inclined members toward this node from nodes 1 & 2, replacing or complementing member_5 and member_6. Also keep node_4 as an intermediary lower top chord to form a planar quadrilateral with diagonal bracing between node_4 and node_5. Connect node_3 to node_4 and node_5 to distribute load path. Reduce area for members under less stress and increase area cautiously along main load paths to meet ±15 stress limit.",

    "reasoning": "By adding node_5 above node_3, load from node_3 can distributing into members (node_3-node_5), (node_5-node_1), and (node_5-node_2), reducing stress in (node_1-node_4) and (node_2-node_4) and eliminating high stress in member_5. This reduces large tension in member_5 and members near top node_4. Areas are adjusted using inputs '0' to '10' where '0' =1 and '1'=0.195 etc. Moderate to high areas around 5-7 for principal members; low areas ~1 or 2 for others. Supports remain pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 to keep statical determinate and adequate reaction support.",

    "scratch_pad_3": "New nodes: node_5: (3.0,5.0). Remove member_5 and member_6, add members: n1-n5, n2-n5, n3-n5, n4-n5. Keep existing members from n1-n3, n3-n4, n1-n2. Estimated lengths: n1-n5 ~5.8, n2-n5 ~3.6, n3-n5 ~2.7, n4-n5 ~1.5. Assign areas balanced approx: 5 to 7 on main members, and reduction down on lightly loaded e.g. member n1-n3 area 2. Mass estimated below 30. Stress expected balanced <15 with additional load path.",
