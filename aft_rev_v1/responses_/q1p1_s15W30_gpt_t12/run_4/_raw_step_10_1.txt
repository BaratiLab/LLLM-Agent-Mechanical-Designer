Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Objective: stress ≤ ±15 and mass ≤ 30.",\n    \n    "analysis": "Current iteration 9: max stress 24.9 > 15 at member_8 connecting node_1-node_6 with area id 1 (0.195). Mass 19.4312 < 30 (good). High stress in member_8 signifying the low area section at a critical member. Other members with low corresponding cross-sections mostly safe. Central nodes (6 and 7) form current truss core, but tension in node_6 to node_1 yielding too high stress due to inadequate section area or geometry. Members with larger area (4, area =3.128) elsewhere probable overdesigned or safe margin.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Strategy: increase area in critical member_8, redistribute forces with additional bracing or alter node_6 position for better load path. Avoid mass increase above 30. Possibly add diagonal bracing between node_3 and node_6 or node_3 and node_4. Remove less important light members or lower their area if stress is low. Maintain nodes for load/support. Careful geometrical shaping for force flow.",\n\n    "proposal": "Refine truss by increasing area of critical members that exceed stress, reduce area on superfluous members, slightly reposition node_6 for better angle. Use area 4 (3.128) for member_8 and member_1. Add one member: node_3 to node_4 to stabilize. Keep node_7 and node_5 to maintain upper compression chords. Proposed nodes unchanged for load and supports, move node_6 to (2.7, 2.4) for better force path. 9 members total with altered areas as per stress demands.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Increasing member_8 area from 0.195 to 3.128 reduces stress by factor ~16, keeping tensile stress below 15. Reducing area of less stressed members (node_7 to node_5 and node_7 to node_6 from 2 to 1) lightens mass. Relocating node_6 slightly upwards and right adjusts load path thus reducing stress in member_8 and member_5. Adding member_3 to node_4 (area 1) braces the central joint structure to resist deformation, sharing load paths and preventing stress concentration. Overall mass estimating below mass limit.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Length approximations: node_1-node_3 ~2m; node_1-node_6 ~ sqrt((2.7)^2 + (2.4)^2) ≈3.6m; node_3-node_7 ≈ sqrt((0.1)^2 + (0)^2 + (0.6)^2)= ~value depends on node_7 pos, keep node_7 (2.8, 3.0).
