  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss with loads, supports, and mass/stress limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load on node_3 diagonal down-left; supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller; max stress Â±15; max mass 30. Current design mass 32.04 >30, stress max 8.63 acceptable. Improve mass with minimal stress increase.",
  
  "analysis": "Current structure almost meets stress limits with max stress 8.63 << 15 and load distribution is acceptable. Mass slightly exceeds limit especially with some large area members (areas 4 and 3). Key is reducing member areas and member lengths while maintaining stiffness. Members '3'-'6' and '3'-'4' are largest contributors to mass. Structure can be modified by repositioning nodes 4, 5, 6 for shorter members and reducing areas for low-stress members.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove intermediate high angle members to reduce lengths. Shift node_5 slightly down and left to reduce long members lengths; node_6 moved closer between nodes 3 and 5 and 4. Reduce areas where stress is low; increase areas only if needed.",
  
  "proposal": "Keep nodes 1,2,3 fixed. Adjust nodes 4,5,6 coordinates for shorter members and better load path. Use truss shape with triangle from node_1-3-4 and triangle node_4,5,6 keeping nodes compact. Reduced member areas for low stress; increase only 3 or 4 where forces are higher.",
  
  "reasoning": "Load at node_3 creates tension/compression on members connected to supports. Members from supports to node_3 and node_4 handle major forces, keep larger areas for these. Others can be smaller. Moving node_4 closer vertically above node_3 shortens main compression members reducing mass. Keeping node_5 and node_6 compact near node_4 shortens lower chords limiting length and stress. Avoid members with very large areas or lengths contributing to excessive mass.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approx: (1-3)=2.0, (1-4)=2.9, (4-5)=2.0, (5-6)=1.0, (3-6)=1.6, (3-4)=2.0, (2-6)=3.2, (4-6)=1.1, areas chosen accordingly: members under tension need moderate area (e.g. 2 or 3), those under low stress area 1 or 0.",
  
  "calculation": "Estimate mass = sum(length * area_factor). Used area factors: '1': 0.195, '2': 0.782, '3': 1.759, '4':3.128. Members with length 2 and area 2 contribute 2*0.782=1.56, shorter members even less. Sample member masses sum to < 30 expected. Max stress expected < 15 given stress history with smaller member areas and slightly shorter lengths.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Final node change limited to nodes 4,5,6 to optimize length. Keep load nodes fixed. Member set forms stable triangulated truss base with triangular load paths for stability. Areas balanced for stress and non-exceed mass limit.",
