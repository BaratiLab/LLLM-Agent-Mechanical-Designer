Current design mass 32.04 >30, stress max 8.63 acceptable. Improve mass with minimal stress increase.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure almost meets stress limits with max stress 8.63 << 15 and load distribution is acceptable. Mass slightly exceeds limit especially with some large area members (areas 4 and 3). Key is reducing member areas and member lengths while maintaining stiffness. Members \'3\'-\'6\' and \'3\'-\'4\' are largest contributors to mass. Structure can be modified by repositioning nodes 4, 5, 6 for shorter members and reducing areas for low-stress members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove intermediate high angle members to reduce lengths. Shift node_5 slightly down and left to reduce long members lengths; node_6 moved closer between nodes 3 and 5 and 4. Reduce areas where stress is low; increase areas only if needed.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep nodes 1,2,3 fixed. Adjust nodes 4,5,6 coordinates for shorter members and better load path. Use truss shape with triangle from node_1-3-4 and triangle node_4,5,6 keeping nodes compact. Reduced member areas for low stress; increase only 3 or 4 where forces are higher.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Load at node_3 creates tension/compression on members connected to supports. Members from supports to node_3 and node_4 handle major forces, keep larger areas for these. Others can be smaller. Moving node_4 closer vertically above node_3 shortens main compression members reducing mass. Keeping node_5 and node_6 compact near node_4 shortens lower chords limiting length and stress. Avoid members with very large areas or lengths contributing to excessive mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approx: (1-3)=2.0, (1-4)=2.9, (4-5)=2.0, (5-6)=1.0, (3-6)=1.6, (3-4)=2.0, (2-6)=3.2, (4-6)=1.1, areas chosen accordingly: members under tension need moderate area (e.g. 2 or 3), those under low stress area 1 or 0.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Estimate mass = sum(length * area_factor).

Sample member masses sum to < 30 expected. Max stress expected < 15 given stress history with smaller member areas and slightly shorter lengths.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Final node change limited to nodes 4,5,6 to optimize length.
