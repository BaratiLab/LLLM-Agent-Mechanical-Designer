Constraints: max member stress ±15, max total mass 30. Output structure should prevent overstressed members and reduce mass.",\n  "analysis": "Current design mass 41.8 > 30, max stress 82 > 15. Highest stresses at members connecting node_7 to node_5 and node_7 to node_4. Current areas where large stresses require heavy members. Need to remove or restructure overloaded members, optimize layout and member areas to reduce stress and mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_7 to simplify truss, reposition nodes 4, 5, 6 to form efficient triangulated structure. Use lighter areas on less loaded members, larger areas to main tension/compression members. Add intermediate nodes to distribute load and reduce member length where stresses peak.",\n  "proposal": "Redesign nodes: keep supports and load nodes fixed (node_1, node_2, node_3). Remove node_7. Slightly raise node_4 and 5 for structural depth. Add node_6 near load node_3 for load transfer. Connect nodes forming triangles avoiding overstressed members. Use areas mostly in 1 to 4 range for balance.",\n  "reasoning": "Triangulated structure improves stability, reduces high local stresses. Smaller cross sectional areas on secondary members reduce weight. Main load path from node_3 (load) to supports via direct members plus triangular support by node_6. Avoid long slender members to minimize bending or buckling. Structure simplified to 6 nodes, 8 members.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Nodal layout: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), load node_3(2,0).
