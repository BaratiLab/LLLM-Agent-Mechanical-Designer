Nodes 1 and 2 fixed; optimize internal node positions and areas for stress reduction.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design is safe and mass efficient but member_3 and member_1 close to 6 and 5 respectively stress. Areas 3 and 2 selected moderately large. Node_6 near center can be repositioned to balance load and reduce stress concentrations. Small area of 1 assigned to members connecting to top node_4 and node_5; could increase area selectively to reduce peak stress. Our goal is to spread stress evenly and avoid excessive cross-sectional area to keep mass below 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Constraint checks satisfied; no nodes at supports can be moved. Node_3 and node_6 movable. Adjacent members\' area can be tweaked from id 1 to 2 or 3 downward to balance stress with minimal mass increase.",\n\n  "reasoning": "By increasing node_6 vertical position slightly and adjusting node_4 and node_5 minimal vertical movement within bounds, we can reduce tensile stress on member_3 and compressive stress on member_1. Reducing area id for low stress members (member_7 and member_8) conserves mass. Use area id 2 for members currently at id 1 if stress permits. Remove area 3 for member_1 if mass allows by minor relocations spreading forces better.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Mass from length*area_id mass mapping; lowering area reduces mass and vice versa. Average length approx 2-4 units. Member_3 and member_1 area 3 approx 1.759 multiplier can be decreased to 2 for downward mass sweep. Iteratively move node_6 to upward center to reduce bending effect.",\n\n  "calculation": "Slightly raise node_6 from (2.6, 2.3) to (2.6, 2.5), move node_4 slightly lower from (3.0, 3.0) to (3.0, 2.9) to balance moment force. Change member_1 area 3 -> 2, member_3 remains at 3; low-stress member_8 area 1 -> 0. Selected dimensions and areas yield estimated total mass ~21 with max stress ~5 dominant on member_3 but reduced on member_1.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Final design node positions retain supports and load node fixed.
