Supports fixed at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Max stress ±15, max mass 30 with predefined area-to-mass mappings. Nodes fixed, must close truss and minimize stress and mass.",\n\n    "analysis": "To ensure a closed truss, nodes should be connected to form a stiff triangular system plus possibly adding members for load transfer. Current three colinear nodes require a vertical node above node_3 to form a triangle and enhance stiffness. Placing a new node 4 above node_3 allows closure of structure into triangular panels. Members connecting node_4 to nodes 1, 2, and 3 stabilize the system and allow stress distribution. Load at node_3 acts downward-left at 45°, so vertical/horizontal members alone cause high stress, diagonal bracing optimal. Areas selected to balance stress and mass, prioritizing smaller area members on light load paths, larger where compression or tension higher.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Introduce node_4 at (2.0, 3.5) above node_3 for triangular form. Members: 1-3, 1-4, 2-3, 2-4, 3-4, and 1-2 (base) to define internal closed truss. Evaluate lengths and loads to estimate stresses. Assign material areas from given set. Use simple statics and assumptions: forces split proportionally to member geometry, symmetric distribution of forces where applicable.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Three initial nodes are colinear; structure is unstable and open. Closed triangular shape is best for minimal mass and stress. Node_4 placed above node_3 at y=3.5 to form roughly equilateral triangle shapes reducing bending moments at node_3 under diagonal load. Use smaller areas where forces expected low e.g. tie members under less load and increase where compression expected to avoid buckling. Load at node_3 resolved into vertical and horizontal components to estimate member forces. Assume axial force only (no bending), consistent with truss theory. Approximate stresses by force / area; forces by equilibrium at nodes. Suzuki-area-to-stress at member midline: stress = force/area, must stay within ±15.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: base(1-2)=6m, 1-3=2m, 2-3=4m, vertical(3-4)=3.5m, diagonals (4-1) and (4-2) calculated by distance formula. Load vector magnitude=10N, angle -45°, components Fx=10*cos(-45)=7.07N leftward, Fy=10*sin(-45)=-7.07N downward. Using equilibrium at node_3 with three members (1-3, 2-3, 3-4), calculate axial forces assuming static equilibrium using projection of forces for force vectors. Assign smallest area to member 1-3 and 2-3 since likely in tension with load transferred through node_4. Larger area to 3-4 as it carries more load.Followed by member 4-1, 4-2 supporting upper node with moderate areas. Calculate mass as sum of (length × area factor): for area factors, insert chosen area ids.
