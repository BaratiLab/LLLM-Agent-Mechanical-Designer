Existing structure fails mass (143.75) and stress (~46.6). Load at node_3 downward-left, nodes 1 and 2 supported. Nodes fixed at supports and load positions; node_5 added previously but led to heavy structure.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design mass too high due mainly to large area \'7\' members (areas=9.578) on members 6,7,8. Max stress exceeded mainly on member_1 with -46.6. Load transferred inefficiently. Initial design was a 4 node structure; adding node_5 caused mass rise. To reduce mass, remove big members with large areas, redesign topology for better force flow. Maintain stability with minimal nodes to reduce complexity and length. Propose triangular or quadrilateral truss with limited members and smaller areas, focusing load path from node_3 to supports through node_4 and node_5 if needed but controlled.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_5, revert to 4 nodes. Use members with smaller areas to lower mass. Use members near nodes 1, 2 to better triangulate loading. Reduce member lengths. Select appropriate area per maximum stress ~15. Plan member selection from area set to keep mass <=30.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_5. Position is unchanged for load and supports. Use 4 nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(3,3). Members: (1-3), (3-2), (1-4), (4-2), (4-3). Use area ids per member: members (1-3) and (3-2) both small area, others bigger but controlled to resist max stress. Estimated areas: member_1:2(0.782), member_2:2(0.782), member_3:4(3.128), member_4:4(3.128), member_5:3(1.759). This balances stress and mass. Total mass ~20-25 within limit.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Smaller area members reduce mass but must carry stress. Taking member length and areas from sets, check stress distribution. Node 4 is critical to transfer load at node 3 to supports with two diagonal members. Eliminating heavy top chord (with node_5) cuts mass drastically. Maintain symmetrical and triangular pattern to ensure stable and stiff structure. Final design resembled an efficient 4-bar triangle plus the base.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate member lengths: member_1 (1-3): 2.0m, member_2 (3-2): 4.0m, member_3 (1-4): sqrt(3²+3²)=4.24264m, member_4 (4-2): sqrt(3²+3²)=4.24264m, member_5 (4-3): sqrt(1²+3²)=3.16227m.
