Constraints: max stress ±15 units; max total mass ≤30. Current max stress ~50 >15. Mass close to 30. Current members oversized or stressed. Need redistribution, reduce high stress above limit while retaining stability.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current structure has high compressive stress on member_1 (-50) and some smaller stresses elsewhere. Max stress is over constraint by more than 3x. Total mass near allowable max. Members near load node_3 and between node_1 and node_3 carry high stress. Member area assignments not optimal. Structure with 4-5 nodes in use, but geometry may be adjusted for stress relief and mass saving.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Need to lower stresses, especially member_1 and adjacent members. Options: add a new intermediate node near node_3 to reduce length of highly stressed members; reduce cross-section where stress is low; increase cross-section strategically on critical members without significantly increasing mass; possibly reposition node_6 slightly for better force distribution. Avoid duplicate members, keep supports/nodes with loads fixed. Explore replacing some members with more direct tension/compression paths.",\n\n    "proposal": "Add a new node close but above node_3 to redistribute forces. Adjust areas as follows: use smaller areas (1 or 2) on tension members; increase areas (3) in high compressive members; shorten and redistribute load path from node_3 to node_1. Suggested nodes: node_6 at (2.0, 2.8) approx. Members: node_1-node_6 (area 3), node_6-node_3 (area 2), node_6-node_4 (area 2), retain node_4-node_2 (area 2), node_3-node_2 (area 1), remove indirectly stressed or redundant members used previously.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Adding a node closer and above node_3 divides long compression segment node_1-node_3; distributing forces reduces compressive stress. Using smaller cross sections (area 1 or 2) for tensile members reduces mass while maintaining strength. Member sets forming triangles around load and supports spread forces better. Using area_ids between 1 and 3 balances stress and mass constraints. Avoid high area members unless necessary to keep mass ≤30 kg. Geometry close to previous but refined positions enhances performance.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Estimate lengths: node_1 (0,0), node_3 (2,0), new node_6 (2.0,2.8), node_4 (3,3), node_2 (6,0), member lengths: node_1-node_6 ~ sqrt(0^2+2.8^2)=2.8, node_6-node_3=2.8, node_6-node_4=approx ~1.6, node_4-node_2=approx 3.6, node_3-node_2=4.0. Cross sectional area impact on mass: e.g., member_1 with length 2.8 and area 3 (1.759) mass≈2.8*1.76=4.93, overall summing small to keep total mass ≤30 and reduce compressive stress <15.",\n\n    "calculation": "Total approximate mass: member_1 (2.8*1.76=4.93), member_6 (2.8*0.782=2.19), member_5 (1.6*0.782=1.25), member_4 (3.6*0.782=2.81), member_2 (4.0*0.195=0.78). Sum approx 11 kg plus supports. Factor in other members similarly. Estimated max stress aligned with areas chosen supporting the force magnitude.
