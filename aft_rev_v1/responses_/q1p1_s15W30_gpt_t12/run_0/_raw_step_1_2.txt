Members with larger areas near the load have low stress, indicating inefficient distribution. The structure has limited vertical support, so node_4 at (3,3) helped but not enough. Current areas favor 3 and 1 mostly. Load at node_3 is mid-span with simple triangle topology causing high stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "The failure is caused mainly by direct compression in member_1. Members_3 and 4 are large area (3), but do not reduce stress sufficiently. Member_5 at area 2 is underutilized. Consider adding a node above node_3 to better carry load vertically, forming a more symmetrical truss.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add a new node (node_5) positioned vertically above node_3 to introduce a force path to supports reducing member_1\'s compressive stress. Connect node_5 to node_1, node_2, and node_3 forming a better load transfer triangle. Adjust member areas using larger areas to reduce stresses under constraints.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Placing node_5 at around (2.0, 4.0) increases load transfer through axial members above node_3. This splits compression in member_1 into multiple members, reducing max compressive stress. Key members from node_5 to supports with larger areas reduce induced stress. By adding struts and diagonals, structure becomes statically determinate and stress is balanced. New members use highest allowed areas near load paths. Use smaller areas on low stress members to control overall mass below 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node_5 fix vertical supports on node_3. Member lengths roughly: node_1-node_5 ~ 4, node_5-node_3 ~1.0, node_5-node_2 ~4.47. Areas chosen: 6 or above for highest stress members, 1 or 2 for others. Approximate total mass adds to ~ 24-28 limit.
