Load applied at node_3.",\n  \n  "analysis": "All member stresses fall comfortably within allowable Â±15 limits. Mass usage is efficient well below maximum. The structure is minimal with 5 members keeping a closed 2D truss topology. Load transfers well with moderate stress values.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Minimal number of members and current node positions are well placed to achieve low stress. No evident overloaded members or high stresses needing reduction. Mass also well balanced.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Attempting to reposition node_6 or change member areas was already explored; results showed stresses either exceeded or mass increased significantly. Given constraint limits, small improvement possible but would cost mass or complexity. Area selections appear optimized with larger option on critical member_1. Current design balances tension/compression stresses well and provides a compact open/closed system.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Valid cross sectional areas are assigned as per stress levels. No nodes hosting loads/supports are moved as per constraints. Minimal increments to stress expected from slight nodal adjustments, but design is constrained by geometry.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Total mass confirm 13.137 < 30 and max stress max(|14.11|) < 15. Cross-sectional areas selected meet stress demands per members. Node_6 position is feasible; small adjustments showed no gain to improve max stress or mass without violation. Closed truss satisfied.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "All optimization metrics meet or outperform convergence criteria. Further optimization runs have historically increased max stresses above allowable.
