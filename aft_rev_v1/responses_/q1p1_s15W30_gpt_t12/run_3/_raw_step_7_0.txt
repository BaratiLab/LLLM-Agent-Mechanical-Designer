Current density distribution inefficient. Current middle node_5 contributes inertia without reducing max stress significantly, causing excess mass.",\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing area on critical edgy members (support to load truss) helps stress, but limited by stress limits. Adding an efficient upper node closer to load and supported nodes that enables triangular optimized bracing reduces bending loads.",\n    \n    "proposal": "Use 4 nodes at: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0) as fixed; Add node_4 approx (3,3.4). Members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_4-node_3 forming a triangulated truss. Avoid extra node_5 to cut mass. Assign areas from low-medium strengths (1 or 2) on tension members to reduce mass while satisfying stress constraints. Fine tune vertical node height to balance compression in triangulated members.",\n    \n    "reasoning": "Triangular braces distribute forces better, avoiding high tensile stress on node_1-node_3 directly. Small area on base horizontal (node_3-node_2) member since no load transferred there can be supported with low area 1, central node_4 adjusts load path.
