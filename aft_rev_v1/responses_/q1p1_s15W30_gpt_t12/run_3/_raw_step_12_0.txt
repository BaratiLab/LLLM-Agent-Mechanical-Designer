Node_1 and node_2 fixed; cannot move. Current mass 48.26 exceeds 30. Max stress 12.54 < 15 allowed but mass exceeds. Need to reduce mass significantly (~40%) and maintain stresses under ±15.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure at iter 11 has low max stress within limits but total mass exceeds limit by 18. Approach: simplify truss to reduce redundancy and heavy members. Use fewer intermediate nodes or optimize their placement to create efficient load path and lighter members. Current nodes are too many and a little spread out, raising beam length and mass. Load applied on node_3 at bottom line under -10 N at -45°. Support line at y=0 from 0 to 6. Improving load path with verticals and diagonals will reduce member areas and mass. Using stronger areas only on critical compression/tension members.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Remove node_8 to avoid redundancy. Keep node_4 and node_5 to create two panels. Connect node_3 with these and supports with minimum members. Assign areas carefully based on stress allowance ±15 with factor 2 safety. Total length × area ≤ 30 mass. Prioritize node placements at skillful vertical heights to mobilize compressive/tensile forces with smaller cross sections.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Simplified 5-node truss: keep fixed nodes node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0) with load, and two upper nodes: node_4(2.9,3.0), node_5(5.0,2.7). Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_4-node_3, node_5-node_3, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3. Area selection optimized with only \'1\'=0.195, \'2\'=0.782, and \'3\'=1.759 selections to minimize mass, no oversized areas. Remove redundant members to keep load path clear.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "A stable truss with two upper nodes linked by diagonals to the loaded node_3 and supports reduces bending. Load path splits vertically and diagonally, reducing stress peaks. Keep small area members 0.195 for low tensile stress members; medium areas 0.782 or 1.759 for compression to keep total mass minimal and stresses safe. Shorter length members reduce mass. Eliminated node_8, which added mass and redundant links.
