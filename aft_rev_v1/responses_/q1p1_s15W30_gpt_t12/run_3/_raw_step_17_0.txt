Supports are pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current max stress exceeds 15 and close to the mass limit 30. Design must reduce stress peaks, redistribute forces efficiently, and minimize member areas without losing stiffness. Existing design has long, thin members with high stress particularly in member_7. Areas range 0.195 to 3.128 mm² used, suggest selectively adjusting areas and rearranging topology.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure has high tensile and compressive stresses, especially members connected close to loaded and support nodes, indicating force path concentration. The compression/tension imbalance is large and member_7 exceeds stress limit. Mass of 26.23 is okay but can be reduced by better load transfer. Triangulation pattern needs optimization to avoid members carrying extreme loads. Adding one well-positioned node at mid-height to split long members and redistribute forces will help. Using medium areas (1-3 range) selectively for larger force members and small areas for minor members is favored.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "The nodes for load/support must remain fixed. Introduce node between node_3 and node_4 to split large force members splitting bending moment. Connections are updated for stable triangulated web. Change area assignment based on force demand: highest force members larger area, others smaller. Avoid members with only one connection. Use precision decimals for node location placement to futureproof. Minimize mass by small-area members unless high stress requires a larger section.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_7 at (2.7, 2.0), between node_3 and node_4 vertical plane to reduce moment arm. Member connections: members from node_1 to node_4, node_4 to node_5, node_5 to node_2 remain; add members node_3-node_7, node_7-node_4, node_7-node_6, node_6-node_3, node_6-node_1 and maintain node_1, node_2 supports with pinned and roller respectively. Assign areas based on stress demand ranging mostly around 2, occasionally 3 or 1 as needed to reduce oversized mass. Members carrying tensile load reduced area when safe, compression enhanced for stability.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_7 splits problematic member_7 in original iteration 16 and redistributes stresses, reducing peak stresses. Triangulation offers increased structural capacity. Member cross sections tailored matching stress vs mass give lower weight. Node coordinates are precisely 2.7,2.0 based on iteration 15-16 transitions for minimal disruption. Choice of areas made to limit max stress in range ±15 and total mass under 30 while enhancing load path balance. Members near load get bigger areas, others minimized. Smaller area members reduce mass to keep under constraint. This approach yields more balanced stress and lighter mass, meeting constraints.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate lengths: node_1(0,0)-node_4(3,3.5) ~4.609, node_4-node_5(5,3) ~2.062, node_5-node_2(6,0) ~3.162, node_4-node_6(3,3) ~0.5, node_6-node_3(2,0) ~3.162, node_3-node_7(2.7,2.0) ~2.236, node_7-node_4(3,3.5) ~1.581, node_6-node_7(2.7,2.0) ~1.118, node_1-node_6(3,3) ~4.243.
