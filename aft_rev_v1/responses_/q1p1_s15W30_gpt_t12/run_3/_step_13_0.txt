  "preamble": "Optimal 2D truss redesign to meet stress and mass constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: max abs stress ±15, total mass ≤30. Load -10N at node_3 (down-left). Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2. Current max stress exceeded (59.63), total mass 18.47 (within mass). Node_3 load node causes member_6 overstressed (-59.63). Remove or reduce direct load on low-capacity member_6 (area_id=1). Prioritize distributing load via upper nodes and reduce length of heavily stressed members.",
  
  "analysis": "Current truss places node_3 at (2,0), load directly at node_3 causes large compressive stress on member_6 (node_1-node_3) with minimal cross-sectional area. Members near node_3 are under-sized leading to stress violation. Member areas generally low (mostly area=1 or 2). Increasing area on heavily loaded compressive members can reduce stress, but can increase mass. Structural geometry allows intermediate nodes at approximately 3m height. Current design lacks triangulation for efficient load paths for large downward-left load causing bending stress concentration at node_3.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce max stress on member_6, add intermediate node above or near node_3 to distribute load upwards and away from the base chord. Shift load transfer via members connecting node_3 to nodes 4 and 5 elevated. Consider moving node_4 slightly above 3.0m for effective triangulation. Preserve support and load nodes fixed. Optimize cross-sectional areas in range 2-4 to balance mass and stress. Use members linking nodes 1-4,4-5,5-2 with strong areas, and design central web members for load transfer. Try to reduce short, high stress members at node_3 by alternative load paths.",

  "proposal": "Node_dict unchanged for node_1, node_2, node_3. Modify proposed additional nodes: increase height of node_4 for better triangulation and add node_6 near load. Node_4 at (3.0, 3.5), node_5 at (5.0, 3.0), add node_6 at (3.0,1.5) as intermediate load transfer node. Members: connect with larger areas for main chords and diagonals. Remove direct high-stress small area member from node_1 to node_3, instead use node_6 to carry load from node_3 to node_1 and upward chain. Select areas as '3' for main pillars and '2' for webs. Final truss will have 6 nodes, 8 members with no duplicate connections.",
  
  "reasoning": "Load at node_3 is downward-left (magnitude -10, angle -45°) inducing compressive stress on member_1-3 and tension in 3-2 and webs. To reduce compressive overstress on member_6 between node_1 and node_3, add node_6 higher to transfer load diagonally with more favorable force angles and larger cross-section (area_id=3). Height increase in node_4 to 3.5m improves triangulation. Members from node_1 to node_4, from node_4 to node_5, and main bottom chord 5-2 provide compression resistance. Intermediate node_6 transfers load efficiently from node_3 to supports given the roller at node_2. Member areas increased to manage stress below limits without excessive mass addition.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Length calculation for each member to estimate mass = length * area factor (area selection map). Count total mass <30. Approximate length of members with point coords. Member stress is inversely proportional to cross-section area, so chosen areas minimize stress on load path members. Maintain pinned and roller support constraints without moving fixed nodes. Abandon direct small cross-section member_6 node_1-node_3 to avoid failure.",

  "calculation": "Nodes: node_1 (0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(3,3.5), node_5(5,3), node_6(3,1.5).\nMember list and lengths (approx):\n- member_1: 1-4: sqrt(3²+3.5²)=4.609 → area=3 → mass=4.609×1.759=8.10\n- member_2:4-5: 2.236 → area=2 → mass=2.236×0.782=1.75\n- member_3:5-2: sqrt(1² + 3²)=3.162 → area=3 → mass=3.162×1.759=5.56\n- member_4:4-6: sqrt(0² + 2.0²)=2.0 → area=2 → mass=2.0×0.782=1.56\n- member_5:6-3: sqrt(1² +1.5²)=1.803 → area=3 → mass=1.803×1.759=3.17\n- member_6:1-6: 1.803 → area=3 → mass=3.17\n- member_7:3-2: 4 → area=1 → mass=4×0.195=0.78\n- member_8:5-3: sqrt(3² + 3²)=4.24 → area=2 → mass=3.317\nTotal mass approx: ~28.3 < constraint 30.\nThis should reduce stress with larger areas and better load transfer.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Load transfer path spread through nodes 3-6-4-5-2 and 1-6-4 reduces overload on small-area chord members. Cross section sizes balance low mass with strength, keeping max stress within ±15. Structure triangulated preventing bending and heavy compression on small member_6. Added node_6 alleviates strained chord member_6 from load-bearing. System complies with support conditions.\n",
