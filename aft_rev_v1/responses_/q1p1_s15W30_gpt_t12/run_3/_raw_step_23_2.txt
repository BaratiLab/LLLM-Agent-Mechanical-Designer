Mass is 24.23, under 30 max. Load applied at node_3 diagonally downward. Support conditions fixed at nodes 1 and 2.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High compressive stress in member_6 (node_6 to node_1) is unsustainable. Nearby members have much lower stress implying force redistribution is unbalanced. To offload node_6-node_1 member, geometry or connectivity near node_6 must change. Area reduction on that member aggravated high stress—likely too small cross-section (area_id=\'1\' for member_6 vs previous iterations with larger cross-section). Nodes 4,5 positioned mid-top span, node_6 underneath. Current structure has redundancy but stress flow not efficient due to eccentric load and geometry.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing member_6 area alone or moving node_6 down might increase stress. Better to reposition node_6 slightly lower and add additional diagonal supports distributing load from node_3 towards supports, e.g., possible member from node_3 to node_1 or node_3 to node_2. Area selection must match stress results. Remove weak members or merge multiple small ones. Aim to keep triangular stable topology and reduce long members under high compression.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Keep existing load and supports nodes fixed. Adjust position of node_6 from (2.2, 2.3) downward closer to x=2, y=1.5 targeting better force distribution. Add an extra member from node_3 to node_1 (direct diagonal) with sufficient area. Reassign areas! Use mid-range to large areas (2 to 4) for critical tension/compression members to keep stresses near ±15. Retain nodes 4 and 5 for upper chords, with node_4 at (3.3, 3.5) and node_5 at (4.6, 3). Connections: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2 form top chord; node_6 connected to node_1, node_3, node_2, node_4. Members: connect node_3 to node_1 and node_3 to node_5. Remove under-stressed redundant members to reduce mass.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Repositioning node_6 lowers lever arm of compressive forces. Adding node_3 to node_1 diagonal with area_id=3 helps alleviate load on node_6 to node_1. Keeping top chord members thicker (area_id=3 for node_1-node_4 and node_5-node_2) distributes load effectively. Lower-arching diagonal members (node_6 to node_3 and node_6 to node_1) with area_id=2 moderates stress. The design respects static determinacy principles and stiffness-to-weight ratio good to achieve constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check lengths and cross-sectional areas for all members. Estimate stress ~ Load / area x length factor; adjust areas if stress outside constraints. Limit total length * area sums to ≤ ~30 mass.
