Load at node_3 downward left, pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 fixed. Current nodes mostly arranged in upper boom shape with added intermediate members causing high stress.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design over stress limit on members 8 (-104.8) and 10 (49+) with also mass slightly exceeding limit. Members with higher area and longer lengths cause these. Points at nodes 7 and 8 with small area connecting complex members result in high tensile/compressive forces. Load applied at node 3 causes large bending stress through node 7, 8. Reducing complexity around node_7, node_8 and optimizing member layout with minimal high area members can lower stress & weight.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Simplify truss to primary triangulated system avoiding high areas and short, highly stressed members. Reduce nodes around mid to lessen stress concentration. Use optimal elevated node at ~3.3 m height to reduce bending at 2 and 3.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove nodes 7 and 8; keep main loading and support nodes. Maintain nodes 1,2,3,4,5 and 6 (move node 6 slightly up). Connect node_1 to node_4, node_4 to node_5 to node_2; node_4 to node_6, node_6 to node_3, and node_3 to node_2. Add member from node_4 to node_2 for lateral stability. Assign areas with emphasis on moderate size. Reduce areas on diagonals and direct bottom chords to maintain stresses under ±15. Node_6 is adjusted upwards to establish better load paths. Because loads & support fixed, nodes 1,2,3 not moved.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangulated max joints for conventional stable truss. Adjust node_6 up to 2.7 to ~3.0 vertical to relieve tensions at close diagonal members with smaller areas. Moderately sized members on high load paths control stress, while lighter members in compression reduce mass. Minimal members reduce total mass. Rib structure for force flow from loads to supports helps reduce max stresses. Areas like \'3\' (1.759) for main loaded members and \'1\' (0.195) at braces reduce mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Length calc between nodes; choose minimum sufficient areas under max stress ≤ |15|.
