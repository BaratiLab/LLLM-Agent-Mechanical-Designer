Mass currently 16.5 < 30, so no mass addition imposed. Focus on stress reduction by geometry and cross-section reallocation. Support layout fixed, load applied at node_3 downward-left. Node_5 internal causing large forcing in members connecting node_5 and node_4.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The current design adds node_5, members connecting node_4, node_5 and node_3, node_2. Member_6 stress is excessively high (766.8) indicating overloading and slenderness issues. Node locations are clustered causing force concentrations especially around node_5. Members with area_id 1 or 2 are not alleviating high compressive stress. There is a redundant or too flexible node_5 near node_4 and node_3 causing inefficient load path. Current stress constraints are violated badly in compression and tension, especially in member_6 and others attached to node_5.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce stress, simplify truss, remove node_5 to avoid stress concentration, strengthen main members, optimize geometry - possibly raise node_4 and relocate nodes for better triangulation. Use areas with moderate values to balance mass and strength. Consider a truss with 4 nodes: supports plus load node plus one apex node, connected optimally as a triangular truss.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_5 to reduce complexity; keep nodes node_1, node_2, node_3 fixed. Add one new node (node_4) appropriately above the base line for triangular truss at approximately [3.0, 3.75]. Use four members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_3 to form stable triangulation. Allocate member areas to keep stresses within ±15, using larger areas in more stressed members and smaller in less stressed.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Simplify structure to remove excessive stress concentration caused by node_5 and redundant members. Triangular simple design ensures good load distribution efficiency with pinned and roller supports. Using an apex node above the base line maintains a statically determinate design avoiding bending moments and reducing member forces. Allocate member sections: heavier for diagonals to carry compression efficiently, lighter for base member to minimize mass. This balances stress and mass constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculated members lengths: node_1-node_4: sqrt(3^2 + 3.75^2) ≈ 4.8, node_4-node_3: sqrt((3-2)^2 + 3.75^2)≈3.95, node_3-node_2: 4.0, node_1-node_3: 2.0. Select area_ids to keep member stress ≤15: choose area 6 or 7(7.04,9.58) for diagonals to reduce stress, area 1 or 2(0.195 or 0.782) for base members for saving mass. Mass estimate: mass = ∑ length × area multiplier. Target mass ≤30. Approximate trial: m1=4.8×7.03=33.74, too high; reduce to area_id 4(3.13): 4.8×3.13=15, m2=3.95×3.13=12.35, base members smaller.
