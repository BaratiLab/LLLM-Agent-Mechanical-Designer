Existing max_stress=45.96 exceeds ±15 limit; mass=30.397 just above 30 allowed limit.",\n  \n  "analysis": "The highest stress occurs in member_8 (\'node_1\'-\'node_3\', area 1), at -45.96 compressive. Member areas 1 and 2 dominate structure mass and stress distribution. Central node_6 is near load but high stress in members including node_6 connects. Existing small area (1 or 2) members connecting node_3 and load transference to supports exhibit overstress. Member_8 is too slender given load. Increase area on critical tension members, reduce on low-stressed. Slightly reposition node_6 for better force flow and add diagonal bracing among load node_3, removable node_6, and existing nodes to reduce tensile stress. Balance adding node members maintaining mass ≤30.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Add bracing between node_3 and node_4 and node_5. Remove redundant member_9 or enlarge credible load paths. Reduce area on member_5 with overload. Adjust node_6 slightly upward to decrease length and stress in members connected. Keep support nodes fixed. Use area codes \'3\', \'2\', \'1\' smartly for stress and load path. Carefully check length and force balances.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Reposition node_6 from (2.1,1.4) to (2.2,1.7), adding stronger area in critical members, increase member_8 area to \'3\' to resist large compressive. Add new member \'member_10\' connecting node_3 to node_4 with area \'1\' to relieve load from member_8. Remove member_9 (node_3-node_5) to reduce complexity/mass. Adjust member_5 area to \'3\' and member_6 area at \'2\'.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Increasing area on high stress member_8 reduces stress to under threshold; slight node_6 raise shortens critical compression member lengths, distributing load. Adding diagonal member between node_3 and node_4 supports well the load path along y-component. Removing member_9 reduces mass and stress concentration near node_3.
