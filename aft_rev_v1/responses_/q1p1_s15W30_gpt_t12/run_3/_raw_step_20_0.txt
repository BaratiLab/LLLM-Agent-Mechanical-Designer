Load at node_3 is -10N at 45° down-left. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller).",\n  \n  "analysis": "High compressive stress on member_6 (node_1-node_3) and member_4 (node_4-node_3) cause failure. Members near loaded node_3 suffer excessive stress due to load orientation and bracing. Existing lower nodes cluster around (2.7,3.2) and (4.2,3.2) but don\'t effectively transfer load within constraints. Member areas for overstressed members are small (area \'1\' or \'2\').",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Consider adding a new stiff node near load node_3 to redistribute forces. Increase diagonal bracing with larger area members to reduce stresses. Maintain existing supports and loaded nodes locations. Avoid long members under tension. Aim for more triangle stability to reduce excessive compressive stresses.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add an intermediate node below load at (2.1, 1.4) to support vertical load transfer. Connect from node_3 to new node, from new node to node_1 and node_2. Increase area on compressive members by picking larger cross sections strategically. Keep node_4 and node_5 near (3.3,3.5) and (4.6,3.0) to maintain a stiff upper frame.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Introducing a vertical support node near load reduces peak bending and compressive stresses. Larger areas on diagonals support compression safely under ±15 constraint. Resulting structure converts horizontal loads through triangulation, lowering member axial stress. Limiting new nodes prevents complexity and reduces mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Set node_4: (3.3,3.5), node_5: (4.6,3.0), node_6: (2.1,1.4). Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_4-node_6, node_6-node_3, node_6-node_1, node_2-node_6, node_1-node_3, node_3-node_5. Areas chosen around 2-4 (0.782-3.128) for compression; tension members smaller areas for mass reduction.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member lengths estimated ~3-5m except short internal braces (<2m). Using area \'3\' (1.759) or \'4\' (3.128) on compressive members, \'1\'(0.195)-\'2\'(0.782) on tension. Using approximate axial force approach, max stress below ±15 predicted. Total mass from members length × areas structurally expected below 26.
