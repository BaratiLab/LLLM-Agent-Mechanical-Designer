  "preamble": "Minimize max stress while keeping mass and stress within limits for the truss.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current truss has 4 nodes (2 fixed at supports and 2 free), 4 members, max stress ~14.11 under 15 limit, mass ~11.34 under 30 limit. Load at node_3 and fixed nodes at node_1 and node_2. Objective: reduce max stress below current 14.11 by repositioning free node_4 and adjusting smaller member areas to reduce balance loads.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress in member_4 is -14.1097 (near compressive limit -15) and member_2 at -8.745. Members 1 and 3 have zero stress, indicating non-optimal load distribution. Distributing forces better by repositioning node_4 can reduce peak stress. Also adjusting cross-sectional areas on members can optimize. Minimizing stress often means improving geometry (nodal placement) to let load flow better with less compression or tension peaks. Mass allows growth up to 30, so area increase possible if shaping helps. Node_3 is fixed due to load, node_1 and node_2 fixed by supports, move node_4 only within plan.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_4 (node_1 - node_3) stress at limit likely from load path imbalance. Length and angle of node_4 affects stress transferred to this diagonal. Moving node_4 slightly higher or closer to node_3 might reduce stress in member_4 and redistribute to member_2. Use intermediate cross-sectional areas between 1 to 3 to tune mass/stress trade-offs.",

  "reasoning": "Move node_4 upward and slightly to the right to distribute load better. Increase member_2 area slightly (from '3' to '4') to reduce stress in member_4 by taking more load there. Keep other members areas low to reduce mass where stress is zero. Area '1' or '2' on zero stress members to save mass and allow higher area where needed. Calculate lengths (Euclidean distance) to ensure mass remains low. Use formula stress ~ load / area and length more strategically by adjusting geometry.", 
  "scratch_pad_3": "Node positions: node_1(0,0) and node_2(6,0) fixed. node_3(2,0) fixed. Move node_4 from (2.9,3.1) to approx (3.2,3.5) to increase vertical height and shift slightly right.\n\nMembers:\nmember_1 (node_1 - node_4): length ~ sqrt(3.2^2 + 3.5^2) ≈ 4.75\nmember_2 (node_4 - node_3): length ~ sqrt(1.2^2 + 3.5^2) ≈ 3.7\nmember_3 (node_3 - node_2): fixed length 4.0\nmember_4 (node_1 - node_3): fixed length 2.0\n\nAssign areas:\nmember_1: area_id '2' (0.782)\nmember_2: area_id '4' (3.128) increased to handle more compression/tension\nmember_3: area_id '1' (0.195) low stress zero\nmember_4: area_id '1' (0.195) reduce cross-section since max stress moved off\n\nCalculate mass estimate:\nmass = sum(length × area) = 4.75×0.782 + 3.7×3.128 + 4×0.195 + 2×0.195 = 3.7 + 11.6 + 0.78 + 0.39 = 16.47 < 30\nExpected max stress to drop below 14 by better vertical force transfer and area increase in member_2.",
  "calculation": "Reposition node_4 to (3.25,3.5) float precise. Updated member connection areas:\n- member_1: area_id '2' 0.782\n- member_2: area_id '4' 3.128\n- member_3: area_id '1' 0.195\n- member_4: area_id '1' 0.195\nMass around 16.5 below max limit and should reduce max stress on member_4 by offloading to member_2 with bigger section. Predicted max stress approaches from around 12-13 as stress in member_4 drops. Full FEM needed but this is expected better load distribution and safer stress values.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Move node_4 higher and right, increase section at member_2 for better force flow. Reduce sections where stresses ~0 to save mass. Mass still well below max. Stress max is expected to reduce below present 14. Precise float coordinates and non-duplicate members done. Fixed node positions maintained per instructions.",
