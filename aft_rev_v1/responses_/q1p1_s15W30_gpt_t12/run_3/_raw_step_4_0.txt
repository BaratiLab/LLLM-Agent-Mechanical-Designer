Current max stress is 35.4 (too high) and mass 16.5 (ok). Modify geometry and areas to reduce stress. Maintain fixed nodes for supports(1,2) and load(3).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has member_4 under excessive compressive stress at -35.4, and member_2 uses large area 4 causing mass rise. To reduce max stress, reduce stiff area on high stress members or add new members for load path redundancy. Avoid very long slender members causing stress concentration.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Introduce additional node raised near load node_3 for load transfer. Redistribute cross sections by using moderate areas for main load carrying elements. Add diagonal member from support node_2 to the upper node to improve triangulation and reduce bending.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add one node_5 at (~3.0, 2.5). New members: member_5 node_2-node_5, member_6 node_5-node_4, member_7 node_5-node_3. Adjust member areas: main tension members to area 3 (1.759), compression members reduced to 2 (0.782), lowest area 1 (0.195) for light elements. Remove member_4 because it\'s high stress and low stiffness connection.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 creates a triangular structure improving stiffness and load distribution. By adding members from node_2 to node_5 and node_5 to node_4 and node_3, the structure gains redundancy lowering stress in previous highly stressed members. Area modifications reduce mass while maintaining safety factor. Triangulated geometry minimizes bending and redistributes axial forces effectively.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths: \\n- node_1-node_4: ~3.97 units\\n- node_4-node_3: ~2.8 units\\n- node_3-node_2: 4 units\\n- node_2-node_5: ~1.89 units\\n- node_5-node_4: ~1.18 units\\n- node_5-node_3: ~1.89 units\\n\\nAssign areas: \'member_1\': 2 (0.782), member_2: 3 (1.759), member_3: 2 (0.782), member_5: 1 (0.195), member_6: 1 (0.195), member_7: 2 (0.782).
