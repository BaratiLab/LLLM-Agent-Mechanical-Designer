Supports pinned at node_1 and roller at node_2 on baseline y=0. Max allowable stress ±15 and max total mass 30. Given structure shows severe stress violations esp. compression at member_4 and member_5.",\n  "analysis": "Current structure has stress spikes due to member_4 and member_5 and relatively low total mass (~10.08). Member areas need careful adjustment, and geometry needs modification for better force distribution. Previous iterations show mass well under limit but stress exceeding by more than an order of magnitude.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Approach: reposition interior nodes to form stable triangular substructures to reduce bending, add bracing between load node and supports. Keep support and load nodes fixed. Remove node_6 to simplify. Use larger area members where compressive stresses are high. Minimize total length to keep mass low. Add diagonal members where necessary for stiffness.",\n  "proposal": "Five nodes: node_1(0,0 pinned), node_2(6,0 roller), node_3(2,0 load), new node_4 ~ (3,3.0), node_5 ~ (5, 3.0). Members connect to form triangles: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_4-node_3, node_5-node_3, node_1-node_3, node_2-node_3, with appropriate area selection (<10) based on force direction and magnitude. Remove unnecessary low-area members that incapably resist tension/compression.",\n  "reasoning": "Triangular topology prevents mechanism collapse. Placing node_4 and node_5 upwards provides vertical height to reduce axial stress. Direct members from supports to load permettront distributing load shear effectively. Increasing member cross-section area selectively at high-compressive members will keep stresses within limit. Keep baseline span 6 units fixed. Avoid node overlaps.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approximated for mass: use leng = sqrt(dx²+dy²). Mass = length × area_factor. Check sum member masses < 30.
