Stress limit ±15, mass ≤ 30 units. Existing design at iteration 5 has mass 16.44 (acceptable) but max stress 39.42 exceeds limit.",\n  \n  "analysis": "High compressive stress on member_4 (node_1-node_3) at -39.42 exceeds ±15 limit. Mass is adequate but insufficient. Members member_1 and member_2 utilize higher area 3 (1.759) but member_4 area is 1 (0.195). Design is a basic triangle with node_4 elevated to 3.75m. Load is at node_3, near support node_1 and node_2. Missing diagonal bracing causing high stress concentration in member_4.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress in member_4 caused by load direction requires load path redistribution, strengthen or add members to marginalize load. Avoid raising node_4 too high as it increases member length and mass. Try adding a new node to split stress. Increase area IDs where stress is near limit. Use existing supports and fixed nodes as per instruction.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add node_5 between nodes 3 and 4 vertically lower than 3.75 to reduce stress in member_4, and add members (node_1-node_5), (node_5-node_3), (node_5-node_4) with varied areas optimizing stress. Increase areas in existing critical members to reduce stress.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding a node_5 at (2.7, 2.5) splits stress path, creating shorter members reducing bending. Increasing area in critical compressive member (node_1-node_4) and tensile members reduces stresses. Including a vertical y-offseted node introduces triangulation reducing stress in diagonal members. Assign areas from available set, balancing stress and mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths and areas estimate mass; areas are from lookup. Primary goal: keep total mass under 30, stresses ≤ ±15. Assume node_5 coordinates such that member lengths are moderate to minimize mass increase. Use areas between 2 (0.782) and 4 (3.128) in tension and compression paths. Increase area on node_1-node_4 and node_1-node_5 from 3 to 4 or 5 as needed. Ideal: redistribute compressive force from member_4.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node_5 at (2.7, 2.5).
