Load at node_3 and fixed nodes at node_1 and node_2. Objective: reduce max stress below current 14.11 by repositioning free node_4 and adjusting smaller member areas to reduce balance loads.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress in member_4 is -14.1097 (near compressive limit -15) and member_2 at -8.745. Members 1 and 3 have zero stress, indicating non-optimal load distribution. Distributing forces better by repositioning node_4 can reduce peak stress. Also adjusting cross-sectional areas on members can optimize. Minimizing stress often means improving geometry (nodal placement) to let load flow better with less compression or tension peaks. Mass allows growth up to 30, so area increase possible if shaping helps. Node_3 is fixed due to load, node_1 and node_2 fixed by supports, move node_4 only within plan.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_4 (node_1 - node_3) stress at limit likely from load path imbalance. Length and angle of node_4 affects stress transferred to this diagonal. Moving node_4 slightly higher or closer to node_3 might reduce stress in member_4 and redistribute to member_2. Use intermediate cross-sectional areas between 1 to 3 to tune mass/stress trade-offs.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Move node_4 upward and slightly to the right to distribute load better. Increase member_2 area slightly (from \'3\' to \'4\') to reduce stress in member_4 by taking more load there. Keep other members areas low to reduce mass where stress is zero. Area \'1\' or \'2\' on zero stress members to save mass and allow higher area where needed. Calculate lengths (Euclidean distance) to ensure mass remains low. Use formula stress ~ load / area and length more strategically by adjusting geometry.", \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Node positions: node_1(0,0) and node_2(6,0) fixed. node_3(2,0) fixed.
