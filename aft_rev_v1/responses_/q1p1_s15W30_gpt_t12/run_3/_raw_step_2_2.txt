Nodes fixed for loads/supports at node_1, node_2, node_3. Optimize internal nodes and members. Prior structure stressed heavily in some members and heavy mass (44.9 > 30). Load at node_3, angle -45° with magnitude 10.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design: large tensile/compressive stresses up to -56.46 and mass > 30. Overly large member areas and possibly inefficient topology. Some members have zero stress and mass indicating poor load path distribution. Too many members with large areas causing mass excess. Nodes placed with some out-of-line loading leading to stress concentration.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Approach: Remove redundant members, reposition node_4 and node_5 to improve load paths and distribute stresses more evenly, use smaller areas but sufficient to meet stress max. Form truss with consistent triangulation to provide stability. Consider simpler geometry with fewer members but efficient load paths from node_3 (loading node) to supports.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_5 to simplify structure and reduce mass. Reposition node_4 vertically above node_3 for better load transfer and clear triangulation. Members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_3 for stable triangles. Choose cross-sectional areas so max stress limits are not exceeded. Areas primarily from range 0.195 to 3.128 to keep mass low.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing node_5 reduces complexity/mass. Placing node_4 near midpoint between nodes 1 and 3 but at optimized height improves load transfer of inclined force. 4 members ensure redundant stable truss able to handle vertical/horizontal and diagonal components. Using smaller area members consistent with max 15 stress limit reduces mass drastically. Crucially maintain supports nodes fixed for stable reactions.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Set node_4 y position ~3.0 from node_1-x=0.0, tricky for geometry but node_4 moved upward relative to node_3 (fixed at (2,0)).
