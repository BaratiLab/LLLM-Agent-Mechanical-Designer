    "preamble": "Optimize truss with pinned and roller supports under one inclined load.",
    "scratch_pad_1": "Objective to meet max stress ±15 and mass ≤30. Current max stress exceeds limit at member_6 (-60.44). Load at node_3 diagonally downward to left. Supports at node_1 pinned, node_2 roller on 6m base.",
    
    "analysis": "Current structure has high compressive stress in diagonal member_6(node_1-node_3) suggesting load path too concentrated. Mass under limit but stresses fail constraint. Node 3 location fixed due to load, nodes 1 and 2 fixed for support. Need additional nodes or rearrangement between node_1, node_3 and node_4 area to reduce member_6 load. Members radiating from node_3 show large stress imbalance. Simplify and redistribute forces. Check if direct tension/compression paths via diagonals from load to supports more efficient to avoid high stress in members connected to node_3.",
    "scratch_pad_2": "Proposed raising node_4 height and adding one more node between nodes 3 and 4 or node_3 and 5 to create triangulated frames. Use small and medium area diameters for high-stress members and smaller in tension if possible. Avoid members with stress > ±15 by better force distribution.",
    
    "proposal": "Add one additional node near center height (~3.2m) closer to node_3 horizontally (like at 2.4m, 3.2m). Connect to node_1, node_3, node_4. Increase node_4 elevation fit for better force flow. Reduce member_6 cross section to smaller area but add triangulation through this new node. Members connected directly to load node and pinned need extra bracing to avoid high compressive stress. Reports show area id '1' leading to high stress; possibly upgrade member areas within constraints or redistribute loads via more members.",
    
    "reasoning": "By triangulating via a new node, load is transferred more evenly to pinned and roller supports—shorter, more direct struts reduce buckling/compressive stress in original long members. Adjust cross-sectional areas so high compression members are thicker while tension members reduced for mass saving. Max mass well below 30 allows some moderate sized members. Keep node_3 fixed at (2.0,0) to keep correct load application point. Use existing support locations permanently fixed.",
    "scratch_pad_3": "Calculations revolve around: Member length × area value sum ≤30 mass; max stress computed from load and area; max stress ≤15 both in compression and tension; Keeping new node position (2.4, 3.2) close to existing cluster, connected by members of moderate lengths (~3.2-3.8m). Cross-sectional selection prioritizes balancing stress capacity and mass. Use from area dict: 3=1.759, 4=3.128, 2=0.782 to fit high stress members. Avoid area 1 or less for members expected to carry max forces. Verify no members overloaded. Target max stress ~12-15.",
    
    "calculation": "New members lengths: node_1-node_8 (~√((2.4)^2+(3.2)^2)=4.0), node_8-node_4 (~≈0.6), node_8-node_3 (3.2m). Assign areas: node_1-node_8 (4=3.128), node_8-node_3 (3=1.759), node_4-node_8 (2=0.782). Existing members: Update multi-member connections: reduce area on longer compression members (like node_1-node_4) to 3 from 4, increase node_4-node_5 as low stress makes it possible. Total mass forecast ~26-29. Verify stress distributions suggesting no member >15 in magnitude. Modified smaller members in tension receive lower area (1=0.195).",
    "scratch_pad_final": "Final design includes 6 fixed nodes, adds node_8 for increased triangulation. Members reassigned areas to balance stress and weight within constraints. No node movement for supports or load nodes. No duplicate members. Anticipate substantially reduced compressive peak stresses due to more favorable force paths.",
