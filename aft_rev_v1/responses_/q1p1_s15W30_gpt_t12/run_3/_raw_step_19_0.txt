Max stress exceeded severely in existing members, especially member_8 (-333), mass under limit but stressed. Need more effective load path and reduced cross-section where possible. Keep nodes_1,2,3 fixed. Nodes 4,5,6 exist; existing reference node and member_8 cause extreme compression stress (~-333).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Extreme compressive stress in member 8 (node_4-node_Reference) indicates reference node causes huge local stress concentration. Member stresses indicate load transfer issue—long slender members or inefficient geometry causing imbalanced stress. Removing node_Reference and redesigning internal nodes and topology to form better triangulated framework with multiple load paths is preferable.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "We re-propose structure removing ‘node_Reference’; place two additional internal nodes positioned near midpoint above base to form well-distributed triangular truss. Use carefully selected small-medium areas (1 to 3) to control mass and limit stress. Connect member network to transfer force from node_3 efficiently to supports node_1 and node_2. Old members with large stress magnitudes are removed or replaced with better topology.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_Reference. Keep original nodes 1,2,3. Define new nodes 4,5 at (2.7,3.2) and (4.2,3.2) for upper chord. Create cross bracing with nodes 4,5 connecting to 1,2,3 to transfer loads efficiently. Cross diagonal members for triangulation. Select areas from 1-3 balancing stress and mass constraints.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular discretization and uniform distribution reduces local stress concentration, structural redundancy and better load path. Small discrete sections reduce mass and numerical results should keep stresses within limits ±15. Internal nodes provide support for axial forces. Diagonal bracing from loaded node_3 to supports reduces moments and compression in members. Minimal use of large area sections avoid mass excess.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Define node coords: node_1 (0,0), node_2 (6,0), node_3 (2,0). Place node_4 (2.7, 3.2), node_5 (4.2,3.2).
