Existing structure stressed member_4 highly (-56), mass 21.1 under max 30.",\n\n    "analysis": "Current design fails max stress constraint due to member_4. Mass is already good. Observing members with compressive stress beyond limit. Member connecting node_4 and node_5 (member_4) is weak under high compressive stress suggesting poor load path or insufficient area or suboptimal geometry.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_2": "Reducing compressive stress of member_4 requires either (a) adding support nodes to shorten length/load or (b) increasing area but high stress still ideal to reduce loading. Also, reorienting node_5 or vertical node_4 height could allow better stress redistribution. Maintain load/support node positions.",\n\n    "proposal": "Keep load/support nodes fixed. Add one intermediate node closer to loaded node_3 above chord line to better distribute forces. Adjust connections so tension and compression spread over multiple members, using cross bracing to reduce critical member stresses. Assign member areas prioritizing larger area near compressive members and smaller on less stressed members. Suggested node_6 at ≈(2.5, 2.05). Connect node_3-node_6, node_6-node_5, node_6-node_4 forming an improved truss. Remove member_4 (node_4-node_5) to reduce largest compressive stress.",\n\n    "reasoning": "Introducing a new node above the load allows load transfer to be shared among more members decreasing stress peaks. Adding node_6 creates shorter diagonals sharing compression, controlling max stress. Triangulating with node_4, node_5 and node_6 leverages geometry to shift members from compression into tension as feasible, lowering stress amplitude. Area ID selection from given ensures reasonable mass (~22-25 range). Removing member_4 eliminates critical high compression member. Short members reduce buckling compressive failure risk. Last iteration showed increasing node count helped.",\n\n    "scratch_pad_3": "Stress target ±15 MPa. Max member length approx 2.0 for added diagonals reduces stress. Area IDs between 2-4 for compression members, 1-3 for tension. Expected mass increase due to node_6 and members is offset by removal of member_4 and thinner members elsewhere.
