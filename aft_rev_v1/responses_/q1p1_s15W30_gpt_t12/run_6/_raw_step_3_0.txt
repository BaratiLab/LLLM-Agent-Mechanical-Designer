Load at node_3 with magnitude 10 at -45°. Supports at nodes 1(pinned) and 2(roller). Current structure too heavy (40.46) and overstressed (max 1287).",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design has overstressed members (>15) and excessive mass (40.46 > 30). Members near load node_3 and node_5 node_2 overloaded. The large members with higher areas and many redundant nodes worsen mass. Member_7 is critical failing with extreme compressive stress. The structure lacks efficient load transfer paths, causing stress concentration. Node_6 adds complexity but no clear benefit. Smaller cross sections or removing/reshaping members needed. Current span 6 units horizontally with loads applied on intermediate node_3. Structure shape should be triangular to optimize load paths and reduce mass.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Simplify structure. Retain load and supports fixed nodes. Reduce redundant nodes (e.g. node_6) or adjust vertical heights. Increase triangulation with nodes between support span, but minimize member length and areas. Assign smaller areas (<= 3.128) first to minimize mass but ensure strength by shortening members. Key is to create direct load transfer path from node_3 to pinned and roller with tension/compression in allowed limits.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove node_6 for simplification. Keep nodes_1,2,3 fixed. Add node_4 as apex, approximate near midpoint with height ~1.6-1.8 for triangulation. Connect members in triangular pattern: [node_1-node_4], [node_4-node_2], [node_3-node_4], and [node_1-node_3], [node_3-node_2] for strong direct force paths. Use areas from {1,2,3} with mostly area \'3\' or less for load carrying members to respect max stress and reduce mass. Structure will have 5 members, allowing good triangular load transfer.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Triangular truss fixes forces into either tension or compression effectively. Minimizing horizontal member length reduces bending and stresses. Right choice of cross section less than existing 3 or 4 areas to reduce mass below 30. Avoid large members near node_3 and node_2 heavily stressed before. Load of 10 at -45° results in tension-compression suitable for triangular system. Member length × area determines mass. Chosen member connections meet structural redundancy for statics and safety.",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate length of proposed members using Euclidean distance.
