Constraints precisely satisfied; load applied at node_3; node_4 position adjusted for minimal stress effect.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Previous iterations saw large stress violations or excess mass; current structure reduces stress below max and utilizes a moderate mass. Node_4 at (3.2,1.5) balances load and member force efficiently.",\n  "reasoning": "Minimizing stress under loading while maintaining closed truss form achieved by positioning free node at 3.2,1.5, to reduce force on the diagonal member_5 and keep member sizes moderate with areas 2-4. Further polygon subdivision not needed as current stress well below limits.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress proportional to member force/area/length; area allocation mixed to balance member load with minimal mass. Node shifts restricted to one free node only; moving node_4 lower or higher leads to previous higher mass or stress spikes.",\n  "calculation": "Member lengths and connections support stress under ±15 with 3,4,2 area ids.
