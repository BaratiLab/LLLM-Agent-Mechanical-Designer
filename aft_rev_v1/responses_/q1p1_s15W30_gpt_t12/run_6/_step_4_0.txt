  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss with 3-node load and 2 supports under stress and mass constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 of -10N at -45°. Supports at node_1 (pinned) and node_2 (roller). Max allowable stress ±15 and mass ≤ 30.",
  
  "analysis": "Current design iteration 3 shows mass=17.4623 < 30 constraint ok; max compressive stress member_1 = -19.68 > 15 limit violation. Members sizes and truss geometry need adjustment to reduce compressive stress on member_1.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 is highly stressed. Current layout nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), (3,1.7). Focus on reducing load in member_1 by unloading tensile load redistribution or adding nodes to create alternate load paths without adding mass excessively.",

  "proposal": "Add node between node_3 and support nodes to create additional load path; move node_4 slightly upward and outwards to better spread compression; reduce area on highly stressed members if possible and increase areas on tension members minimally.",
  
  "reasoning": "Original design too stiff near member_1 under compression, causing stress violation. Adding a mid-node upwards near node_3 redistributes forces into triangle truss form, improving load transfer. Increasing node_4 height enhances triangle stability. Adjust member areas to keep mass under limit and reduce compressive stress by increasing member cross-section selectively.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Added node_5 at x=2.7, y=2.1 to create alternate compression path. Use areas 3 or 4 for member_1 reduced from 2 to 1 not safe due to stress; increase compressive members' cross-section. Reduced member areas on members with lower stresses (member_4 and 5) to 1 or 2. Member lengths recomputed, mass sum checked.",

  "calculation": "Node coordinates: node_1 (0.0,0.0), node_2 (6.0,0.0), node_3 (2.0,0.0), node_4 (3.4,1.9), node_5 (2.7,2.1). Estimate member lengths and select areas: \
member_1 (node_1-node_3)=2m, use area '3'=1.759 to reduce stress; \
member_2 (node_3-node_2) ~4m, area '3'=1.759; \
member_3 (node_1-node_4) ~3.74m, area '4'=3.128 higher for compression; \
member_4 (node_4-node_2) ~2.24m, area '1'=0.195 lower; \
member_5 (node_3-node_4) ~2.5m, area '2'=0.782; \
member_6 (node_4-node_5) ~0.32m, area '1'=0.195 (new member); \
member_7 (node_5-node_3) ~2.2m, area '3'=1.759 to help redistribute compressive forces. \
Mass sum < 30, check stresses estimated lower with redistributed tension/compression. \
Expected max stress within ±15.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Optimized node placement provides new load paths; member areas selected balancing mass and stress. Members adjacent to load have increased area for compression; less stressed members have lower areas. Structural triangulation enhanced. All constraints expected met.",
