Heaviest members: member_3 and member_5. Using standard four-node truss with one internal node. Loads apply a downward-angled load at node_3. Supports fix nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller) at base. The internal node can be relocated for better load distribution. Element areas seem too large, mass-heavy especially members connecting node_4.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce mass, either use smaller cross-sectional areas, shorten members or change truss layout. Load at node_3 suggests a triangular topology may be optimized. Member_5 and member_3 are long and heavier - reducing their length or area helps. Possibly place node_4 closer to nodes 1 and 2 to reduce length or create additional nodes for better force path.",\n\n  "proposal": "Keep nodes 1,2,3 fixed. Move node_4 downward near 2D midpoint between node_3 and ground (approx [3.5,1.5]) to reduce length between node_4 and base. Introduce a new node_5 at optimized location to improve force paths (between node_3 and node_4 and node_2). Reassign members with smaller section areas controlling stresses below 15 MPa."\n,\n  "reasoning": "Reducing member length reduces mass. Adding an additional node allows better force distribution and smaller member sizes in compression and tension. Use lighter sections areas such as 2 or 3, except in member(subjected to highest forces). Triangular bracing will improve stability and reduce shear. Avoid very high section areas to reduce mass under constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Evaluate new node coordinates as node_4 (3.5,1.52) and node_5 (2.8,1.1).
