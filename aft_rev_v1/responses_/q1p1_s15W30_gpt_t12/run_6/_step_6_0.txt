  "preamble": "Optimization at iteration 5 achieves constraints; stress and mass within limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Stress max 11.58 < 15 allowed; total_mass 28.2 < 30 max; load and support unchanged nodes fixed; members area and connectivity consistent.",
  "analysis": "All member stresses under ±15; total mass under maximum allowed 30. Constraints precisely satisfied; load applied at node_3; node_4 position adjusted for minimal stress effect.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Previous iterations saw large stress violations or excess mass; current structure reduces stress below max and utilizes a moderate mass. Node_4 at (3.2,1.5) balances load and member force efficiently.",
  "reasoning": "Minimizing stress under loading while maintaining closed truss form achieved by positioning free node at 3.2,1.5, to reduce force on the diagonal member_5 and keep member sizes moderate with areas 2-4. Further polygon subdivision not needed as current stress well below limits.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress proportional to member force/area/length; area allocation mixed to balance member load with minimal mass. Node shifts restricted to one free node only; moving node_4 lower or higher leads to previous higher mass or stress spikes.",
  "calculation": "Member lengths and connections support stress under ±15 with 3,4,2 area ids. Total mass computed from lengths × area is 28.2087 – within mass limit. Small positive and negative stresses well below 15 in absolute.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Design satisfies all stress and mass constraints, load and support boundary conditions held. No major improvements seem possible with present structural entities and only node_4 movable.",
