Supports at node_1 (pinned), node_2 (roller). Max stress ±15, Max mass ≤30. Existing design max stress 20.49 (violates), mass 29.25 (close). Modify geometry and areas to reduce high stress in member_4.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design member_4 stress 20.49 exceeds ±15 stress limit, member_4 uses smallest area (1). Member_4 connects node_4(3.4,1.9) to node_2(6,0). High stress suggests load path not optimal; member_4 under tensile/compressive stress over limit. Mass near limit (29.25). Adding nodes/redistributing members could reduce stress while controlling mass. Node_5 placed near node_4 but members to node_5 are 0 stress, indicating potential inefficiency. Remove or reposition node_5. Try simpler trapezoidal layout with 3 nodes above chord for efficient load path.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Reduce node count by removing unnecessary node_5. Move node_4 slightly left/down for better force flow. Use larger cross-section in critical member_4 and moderate in others. Redesign members connecting from load to supports distributing load path.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Nodes: Keep supports & load nodes fixed: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0).

No node_5.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Reducing nodes reduces complexity. Slightly lowering node_4 reduces member_4 length diminishing stress. Increasing member_4 area reduces stress to acceptable. Maintaining cross-sectional areas in key compression/tension members balances mass and strength. Using area_set from indices: 1=0.195,2=0.782,3=1.759,4=3.128. Keeping mass under 30 is possible with modest areas and length control.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate approximate lengths: node_4-node_2 ≈ √((6-3.2)^2 + (0-1.5)^2)=√(7.84+2.25)=√10.09≈3.177. Areas used sqrt(area*m length) scales mass. member_4 upgraded from area_id 1(0.195) to area 4(3.128) offsets stress riser. Total mass estimated < 30. Member stresses expected under limit by geometry.
