Members sizes and truss geometry need adjustment to reduce compressive stress on member_1.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Member_1 is highly stressed. Current layout nodes at (0,0), (6,0), (2,0), (3,1.7). Focus on reducing load in member_1 by unloading tensile load redistribution or adding nodes to create alternate load paths without adding mass excessively.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add node between node_3 and support nodes to create additional load path; move node_4 slightly upward and outwards to better spread compression; reduce area on highly stressed members if possible and increase areas on tension members minimally.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Original design too stiff near member_1 under compression, causing stress violation. Adding a mid-node upwards near node_3 redistributes forces into triangle truss form, improving load transfer. Increasing node_4 height enhances triangle stability. Adjust member areas to keep mass under limit and reduce compressive stress by increasing member cross-section selectively.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Added node_5 at x=2.7, y=2.1 to create alternate compression path.
