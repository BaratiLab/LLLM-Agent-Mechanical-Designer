Constraints: |stress| ≤15; mass ≤30. Current stress exceeds on member_1 (19.5), others safe. Mass (26.8) under limit. Change needed to reduce stress on member_1 and member_3.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current design oversizes members connecting node_1 to node_3, node_3 to node_5, causing high stress on member_1 (compressive) and member_3 (tensile). Member_5 has zero stress indicating possible redundancy. Sparser area distribution or altering geometry can reduce member length/stress imbalance.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Idea: Remove unnecessary member_5 (node_5-node_4) to simplify and redistribute load paths. Adjust node_5 slightly down and node_4 lower to reduce force on top members. Keep node_1,2,3 fixed. Reduce area of some members below 3 to 2 or 1 to save mass. Keep member_6 (node_4-node_2) with small area to support load transfer.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Remove member_5. Adjust node_4 to y=1.8 from 2.25 to reduce triangle height, node_5 lower y=0.4 for better support line. Reassign areas smaller for compressed members on long members to reduce stress. Members: member_1=\'node_1-node_3-area_2\' (lower area), member_2=\'node_3-node_2-area_2\', member_3=\'node_1-node_5-area_2\', member_4=\'node_5-node_2-area_2\', member_6=\'node_4-node_2-area_1\', member_7=\'node_3-node_5-area_2\'. Node_5 moved lower for better force distribution, node_4 lowered to reduce stress at node_4.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Removing zero-stress members reduces weight. Smaller triangular height reduces stress in cables from node_4. Lowering node_5 improves force distribution through fewer high-stressed members. Using medium areas (area_id \'2\' =0.782) reduces mass and acceptable strength combine with shorter members.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths recalculated, e.g. member_1 length = distance from (0,0) to (2,0)=2 length units. Stress reduction expected by decreasing area and member length, dead load paths redistributed.
