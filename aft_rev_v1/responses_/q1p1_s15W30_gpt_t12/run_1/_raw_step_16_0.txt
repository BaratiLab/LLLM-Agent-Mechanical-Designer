Highest stress found in member_3 (tension 13.18) and member_1 (compression -9.52). Area sizes used appear mostly 3 and 4; heavy sections on members_1 and _7 increasing mass. Members_6 has zero stress and low mass, candidate for removing or area reduction to save mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Look at reducing cross-sectional area of non-stressed members; slightly adjust node_4 and node_5 to better distribute forces and reduce high tension at member_3; adjust member areas toward minimum needed to keep stress under constraints without increasing max stress. Eliminate or reduce unnecessary heavy members, especially member_1 and member_7.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_6 has zero stress, so consider area reduction or removal to save weight. Member_7 uses area 4 and has moderate compression stress -3.5; reducing area to 3 may reduce mass without exceeding stress limit. Member_1 shows highest compression load but reducing cross-section may increase stress; alternatively slightly increasing vertical coordinate y of node_4 or relocating node_5 can improve force distribution. Members directly connected to high-tension member_3 (node_5) may be tuned by slight node position changes respecting fixed nodes. Use same topology (closed truss) with nodes fixed at support/load points. Optimize areas reducing heavier-to-lighter sections for moderate stress members keeping max stress ≤ 15.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Current sectional areas (area_id): member_1:4 (3.128), member_2:3 (1.759), member_3:3 (1.759), member_4:3, member_5:2, member_6:1, member_7:4. Possible area reduction to area_id 3 (1.759) for member_1 and member_7; may increase stress slightly but probably stays below 15. Vertex nodes preserved at their given points. Node 4: (3.6,2.0), Node 5: (2.65,0.55) - Try raising node_4 slightly and adjust node_5 slightly left/down to optimize force distribution.",\n  \n  "calculation": "1. Adjust node_4 upward by +0.25m (y=2.25) from (3.6,2.0) to increase truss height improving axial force alignment and reduce bending or tension spikes. 2. Move node_5 downward by 0.1m to (2.65,0.45) and slightly left by 0.05m to (2.6,0.45) to optimize triangle base, possibly reducing stress in member_3 and improving load path. 3. Reduce areas of members from \'4\'(3.128) to \'3\'(1.759) for member_1 and member_7. 4. Keep members_6 area 1 since it has zero stress but provides stability. 5. Slightly increase area of member_5 from 2 to 3 if needed due to shifted position to keep member efficient and avoid stress spikes. Estimated mass impact: slight reductions from area decreases, offset by possible need to increase member_5 area, total mass still ≤ 30. Estimates stress reductions roughly 10-15% at previously max loaded members member_1 and member_3 due to node raising and area tuning.
