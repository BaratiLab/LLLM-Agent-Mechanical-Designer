Current load/support unchanged.",\n  "analysis": "Member 1 shows highest compressive stress near limit. Members 3 and 4 are under tension but moderate. Shifting node_4 slightly up and node_5 slightly downward but closer to node_3 may reduce stress in member 1 and redistribute forces effectively. Current mass is well below limit, so area redesign not urgent. Node 1 and 2 fixed positions anchoring supports.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Moving node_4 up slightly can reduce moment and compressive force through member_1. Bringing node_5 down closer to baseline helps reduce truss height and likely reduce force in member 1. Members with area 3 remain for members carrying higher loads.",\n  "reasoning": "Higher compressive force in member_1 is linked to load path through node_3 to node_1. Increasing elevation of node_4 assists force transfer to node_2 support through top chord, reducing stresses on bottom chord portion. Slight lowering of node_5 distributes tension members better to reduce stressed area.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "New node_4: y from 2.4m to ~2.65m (up ~0.25m). New node_5: reduce y from 0.85m to ~0.75m and x slightly toward node_3 from 2.7m to 2.6m.",\n  "calculation": "Original stress member_1 = -12.53 (compression). Increase distance from node_4 upward shifts load redundancy. Slight lower node_5 reduces tension trend. Mass estimate: member length changes minimal; sum mass remains ~25.5-26 < max 30. Stress redistributed to members 5 and 7 which are underutilized now. Check no violations of constraints on max stress ±15 or mass ≤ 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Assumption: member areas remain constant for load-bearing members, as current design balanced between mass and stress with acceptable max stress < 13.5.
