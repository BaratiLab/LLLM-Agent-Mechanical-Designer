  "preamble": "Optimize truss node positions to reduce stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective: Minimize max stress ≤ ±15, mass ≤ 30. Current max stress 10.34 within limits; mass 27.37 close to limit. Load at node_3 (-10, -45 deg). Node_1 and node_2 fixed supports. Node_3 fixed horizontal, nodes 4 and 5 free to move. Areas selected from given discrete set, current areas mostly '3' (1.759 area) in main lower members.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress is driven by member_8 (-10.344 compressive, node_3-node_5), suggesting high axial load. Member masses are uneven—top chord by area '1' smaller, lower diagonals medium. Node_5 position (3, 1.8) likely suboptimal; adjusting its vertical position may balance force better. Node_4 may shift slightly to improve load path. Load node_3 at (2,0) fixed. Lowering area in highly stressed members could overload those members; better is geometric tweak.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Aim to shift node_5 slightly left/down toward node_3 or toward node_1 to reduce member_8 tension. Also consider raising node_4 vertically for improved inflection and closing truss polygon. Maintain truss closed with members_5,6,7 etc intact. Ensure no duplicate members.",
  
  "reasoning": "Reducing member_8 stress critical. Currently member_8 (node_3 to node_5) longest dimension and highest stress. Bringing node_5 closer horizontally to node_3 reduces length (mass) and may lower stress. Also height reduction reduces vertical projection where tension is highest. Slight raise of node_4 can improve load transfer. Areas selected will remain similar, using '3' for primary chords. Use radius calculation for member length, multiply by area to estimate mass. Ensure total mass ≤ 30 check.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths approx:\n- member_1: node_1(0,0) to node_3(2,0) length=2\n- member_8: node_3(2,0) to node_5(3,1.8) length=√(1²+1.8²)=~2.06\nReduce this length? Try node_5 x ~2.5, y lowered from 1.8 to ~1.2\nEstimate mass with area 1.759: length*1.759. Current ≤30 satisfied.\nCheck stress reduction via position changes as tuned nodes reduce force demands.\nKeep area consistent: lower area members might risk stress violations.",
  
  "calculation": "Move node_5 from (3.0,1.8) to (2.5,1.2). This shortens member_8 length from 2.06 to √(0.5² +1.2²) = √(0.25+1.44)=~1.28\nMass member_8 decreases approx 1.28*1.759=2.25 vs prior 3.6. Selected area '3' (1.759) maintained.\nRaise node_4 from (4.0,3.0) to (4.1, 3.3) to improve stiffness and balance tension in members 6 and 7.\nCheck resulting mass: slight shifts minimal length changes by others. Potential new total mass ≤29.\nReassign member areas for structure per loading: maintain '3' for majority but reduce mass in less stressed members if needed.\nMember length approximations post-change:\n- member_5(node5-node4): from (3.0,1.8)-(4.0,3.0) length~2.16 →  (2.5,1.2)-(4.1,3.3) √(1.6²+2.1²)=2.66 slightly longer, area = 2 (0.782) to manage mass increase.\n- member_3 and 4 keep area '3'.\nAll constraints assess mass and stress better balanced.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Changes: node_5 from (3,1.8) to (2.5,1.2), node_4 from (4,3) to (4.1,3.3). Keep all other nodes fixed. Updated members connectivity maintained. Areas assigned: major members area '3', member_5 area reduced to '2'. Stress expected reduced in member_8 and possibly overall, total mass faithful <30.",
