Constraints force balancing mass and strength.",\n\n  "proposal": "Maintain nodes_1,2,3 at same positions (constraint). Move node_4 lower and shift closer to middle. Move node_5 slightly lower and adjust member connections to reduce mass. Reduce member 3 and 4 areas, weaken only members with low stress. Remove member_6 to save mass, verify structure stays stable by adding truss diagonal from node_1 to node_4 with smaller area. Final members: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-node_5, node_5-node_2, node_5-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_5. Use mostly area_id 2 or 3 (0.78 or 1.759) with few smaller like 1 or 0 if stress allows.",\n\n  "reasoning": "To reduce mass, reduce areas on lightly stressed members; remove unnecessary stiff members with small benefit. Adjust node_5 position to shorten members 3, 4. Lower node_4 to reduce member lengths from poles but keep enough height to sustain loads. Do not modify node_3, node_1, node_2 for loading and support consistency. After structural simplification, use areas from filtered set under lower values ensuring max stress under 15. Consider shortened members and simplified truss geometry for optimized load paths.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculations: e.g. member_1 (node_1-node_3): length ~2 m; member_3 (node_1-node_5): reduced length <3 m by shifting node_5 down; Areas 3=1.759; Length 3m × 1.759 = 5.3 mass approx.
