Current max stress 10.34 within limits; mass 27.37 close to limit. Load at node_3 (-10, -45 deg). Node_1 and node_2 fixed supports. Node_3 fixed horizontal, nodes 4 and 5 free to move. Areas selected from given discrete set, current areas mostly \'3\' (1.759 area) in main lower members.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Max stress is driven by member_8 (-10.344 compressive, node_3-node_5), suggesting high axial load. Member masses are uneven—top chord by area \'1\' smaller, lower diagonals medium. Node_5 position (3, 1.8) likely suboptimal; adjusting its vertical position may balance force better. Node_4 may shift slightly to improve load path. Load node_3 at (2,0) fixed. Lowering area in highly stressed members could overload those members; better is geometric tweak.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Aim to shift node_5 slightly left/down toward node_3 or toward node_1 to reduce member_8 tension. Also consider raising node_4 vertically for improved inflection and closing truss polygon. Maintain truss closed with members_5,6,7 etc intact. Ensure no duplicate members.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Reducing member_8 stress critical. Currently member_8 (node_3 to node_5) longest dimension and highest stress. Bringing node_5 closer horizontally to node_3 reduces length (mass) and may lower stress. Also height reduction reduces vertical projection where tension is highest. Slight raise of node_4 can improve load transfer. Areas selected will remain similar, using \'3\' for primary chords. Use radius calculation for member length, multiply by area to estimate mass.
