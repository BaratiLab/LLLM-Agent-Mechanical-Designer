Current max stress 68.5 exceeds limit. Total mass 10.7 within limit. Need to reduce stress, likely by redesigning topology and member areas.",\n  "analysis": "Current structure shows excessive compressive stress (-68.5) in member_1 with area 0.195. Load at node_3 is significant (-10 at 45°), balanced mostly by members with small areas connected to node_3. Structure uses 4 nodes, 5 members. Supports at nodes 1 and 2 as pinned and roller respectively, fixed positions. To reduce stress, enhance load path with better triangulation, redistribute force efficiently, use larger areas strategically without exceeding mass.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress high in member_1 (node_1 to node_3). Current members from node_3 to base line are weak (area 0.195). Could increase area on critical edges or add/type topology. Adding a new node between supports and load node to distribute stress may help. Avoid adding mass unnecessarily.",\n  "proposal": "Add one new node above current layout creating two new diagonal members from supports to new node above line between supports and node_4. This stiffens truss, shares load. Reduce member areas on less stressed members. Use areas 3, 4, 5 as needed. Increase member area for member_1 to 4 or 5. Final topology includes nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and new node_5. Members connect 1-3, 3-2, 3-5, 5-1, 5-2, 5-4, 4-1, 4-2 carefully selected.",\n  "reasoning": "Max stress in member from node_1 to node_3 can be reduced by increasing area and adding new load path. Adding node_5 around x=3.0, y=1.8 gives better force distribution triangles. Arms between supports and node_4 enhanced by node_5. Maintain supports and load nodes fixed. Area selection balances added mass and stress: main heavily loaded members get area 4 or 5. Lighter members use area 2 or 1. Total mass stays below 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(4,3), node_5(3.0,1.8).

Mass calc with length*area for each member ensuring sum ≤ 30. Areas set to reduce stress in critical edges, lower areas where forces are lower.",\n  "calculation": "Estimate lengths: 1-3 ≈ 2m, 3-2 ≈ 4m, 1-5 ≈ sqrt(3²+1.8²)=~3.48m, 5-2 ≈ sqrt(3²+1.8²)=~3.48m, 5-4 ≈ sqrt(1² + 1.2²) = ~1.562m, 1-4=5 m, 4-2=3 m, 3-5= sqrt(1² + 1.8²)=~2.06m.
