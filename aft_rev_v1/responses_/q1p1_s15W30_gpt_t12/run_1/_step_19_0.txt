  "preamble": "Optimal design found with closed 2D truss within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Constraints: stress ≤±15, mass ≤30. Current max_stress 10.97 < 15, total_mass 28.0126 < 30, structure closed with multiple nodes and members. Load on node_3, supports node_1 and node_2 pinned and roller fixed.",
  "analysis": "The current structure has all member stresses within allowable levels and mass under maximum. Members have allocated area sizes balancing mass and strength. Nodal layout maintains structural shape with internal node connections reducing stress concentration.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further nodal movement restricted at loaded and support nodes. Limited gains expected moving interior nodes due to constraints. Member area and configuration appear near optimal.",
  "reasoning": "Max stress (10.97) safely below 15 limit and total mass (28.01) below max 30 currently. Reducing mass further risks strength loss, increasing mass unnecessary. No stress concentration or boundary violations detected. Truss configuration closed and stable.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "No violative member stresses. Member areas chosen rationally to handle tension/compression. Load and support configuration fixed. Interior nodes positioned for balanced triangulation.",
  "calculation": "No movements or member adjustments improve max stress without increasing mass beyond limit or violating constraints, given current iteration and history.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Final check confirms optimized status at iteration 18, constraints met, structure closed. Stop optimization.",
