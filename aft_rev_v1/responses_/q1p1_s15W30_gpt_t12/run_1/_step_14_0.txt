  "preamble": "Further optimization needed to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 13.49 < 15, mass 25.42 < 30. Load at node_3, supports fixed. Current setup: node_4 and node_5 movable, areas mostly 3 or lower, stress good but can improve. Closed truss with 7 members. Aim: reduce max stress and possibly mass while maintaining constraints.",
  
  "analysis": "Max compressive stress on member_1 is highest at -13.49 with area 3. Tensile max stress member_3 at 9.84 with area 3. Members 5 and 6 show zero stress indicating possible redundancy or poor load transfer. Node 5 coordinates (2.65, 0.75) and node 4 (3.6, 2.5) can be adjusted slightly. Currently total mass is moderate at 25.42. Stress distribution shows member_1 under high compression; adjusting node_5 position to better align forces may reduce max stress and redistribute load on this member and adjacent ones.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Relocate node_5 downward slightly to decrease compression in member_1, increase load sharing. Slightly move node_4 lower or closer towards center to reduce tension in member_3. Consider incremental shifts around Â±0.1 range. Keep fixed nodes unchanged. Maintain member areas due to acceptable mass constraints. Avoid areas increase unless stress can significantly drop.",
  
  "reasoning": "Moving node_5 downward (lower y) reduces leverage causing high compression in member_1 by changing force paths. Lowering node_4 closer to node_5 will reduce tension in member_3. Member_5 and member_6 zero stresses suggest optimized length or alignment, keep as is. Given previous trends, small position changes proved effective. Avoid mass increase but because constraints permit up to 30 mass units, slight minor area increases only if justified.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Check length and expected stress impacts of nodal movements: decrease y of node_5 to about 0.6 will shorten member_1 and possibly reduce stress. Lower node_4 y to about 2.3 may improve diagonals loading. Member area adjustments may not be needed now. Confirm no member length anomaly or node overlap.",
  
  "calculation": "Set node_4 to (3.6, 2.3) from (3.6, 2.5). Set node_5 to (2.65, 0.60) from (2.65, 0.75). Keep all member areas the same for consistency and because current mass is well below constraint. Anticipate lower compressive stress on member_1 and lower tensile on member_3. Keep the same member topology. Ensure no node shifts at supports or load nodes. Total mass estimated to remain ~25.4, max stress expected below 13.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Nodal relocations incorporated precision floats, no area changes. Retain closed truss topology and given member connections. Based on previous iterations, stress should reduce. Stop criteria not met, keep iterating.",
