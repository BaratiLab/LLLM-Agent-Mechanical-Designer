  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss for load at node_3 with constraints on stress and mass.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress ±15, max mass 30. Current max stress 68.5 exceeds limit. Total mass 10.7 within limit. Need to reduce stress, likely by redesigning topology and member areas.",
  "analysis": "Current structure shows excessive compressive stress (-68.5) in member_1 with area 0.195. Load at node_3 is significant (-10 at 45°), balanced mostly by members with small areas connected to node_3. Structure uses 4 nodes, 5 members. Supports at nodes 1 and 2 as pinned and roller respectively, fixed positions. To reduce stress, enhance load path with better triangulation, redistribute force efficiently, use larger areas strategically without exceeding mass.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress high in member_1 (node_1 to node_3). Current members from node_3 to base line are weak (area 0.195). Could increase area on critical edges or add/type topology. Adding a new node between supports and load node to distribute stress may help. Avoid adding mass unnecessarily.",
  "proposal": "Add one new node above current layout creating two new diagonal members from supports to new node above line between supports and node_4. This stiffens truss, shares load. Reduce member areas on less stressed members. Use areas 3, 4, 5 as needed. Increase member area for member_1 to 4 or 5. Final topology includes nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and new node_5. Members connect 1-3, 3-2, 3-5, 5-1, 5-2, 5-4, 4-1, 4-2 carefully selected.",
  "reasoning": "Max stress in member from node_1 to node_3 can be reduced by increasing area and adding new load path. Adding node_5 around x=3.0, y=1.8 gives better force distribution triangles. Arms between supports and node_4 enhanced by node_5. Maintain supports and load nodes fixed. Area selection balances added mass and stress: main heavily loaded members get area 4 or 5. Lighter members use area 2 or 1. Total mass stays below 30.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Nodes: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(4,3), node_5(3.0,1.8). Members and areas: m1(1-3,4), m2(3-2,4), m3(1-5,4), m4(5-2,4), m5(5-4,2), m6(1-4,1), m7(4-2,1), m8(3-5,2). Estim length and stress for load -10@-45° at node 3 distributed by triangle geometry. Mass calc with length*area for each member ensuring sum ≤ 30. Areas set to reduce stress in critical edges, lower areas where forces are lower.",
  "calculation": "Estimate lengths: 1-3 ≈ 2m, 3-2 ≈ 4m, 1-5 ≈ sqrt(3²+1.8²)=~3.48m, 5-2 ≈ sqrt(3²+1.8²)=~3.48m, 5-4 ≈ sqrt(1² + 1.2²) = ~1.562m, 1-4=5 m, 4-2=3 m, 3-5= sqrt(1² + 1.8²)=~2.06m. Compute mass sum = Σ(length*area): (2*3.128)+(4*3.128)+(3.48*3.128)+(3.48*3.128)+(1.56*0.782)+(5*0.195)+(3*0.195)+(2.06*0.782)=6.256+12.512+10.88+10.88+1.22+0.975+0.585+1.612=44.92 too high. Need to reduce areas slightly, set main to 3 (1.759), others to 1 or 2. Iterated mass ≤30 achievable. Stress reduced because load paths improved and member sizing adjusted.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Final configuration: node_1(0,0), node_2(6,0), node_3(2,0), node_4(4,3), node_5(3.0,1.8). Areas: m1,m2,m3,m4 =3 (area_id '3'), m5,m8=2 ('2'), m6,m7=1 ('1'). Mass estimated 27~ within 30. Max stress expected ≤ ±15. Member count increased, better triangulation, load path effective.",
