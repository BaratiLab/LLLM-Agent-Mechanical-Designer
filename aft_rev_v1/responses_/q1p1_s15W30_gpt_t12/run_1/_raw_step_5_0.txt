Area selection favors rigid members (area_id \'3\') for high stress members. Node_5 moved for better force distribution but member_6 stress still max positive stress.",\n  "analysis": "Member_6 (node_1-node_4) has max tensile stress near limit. Decreasing stress there could improve max stress state. Node_4 and node_5 heights can be tweaked to slightly reduce member_6 axial load. Member areas mostly at 3 or lower; potential to lower some areas if stress allows. Current structure well within constraints, but can shift node_5 lower or redistribute node_5 x slightly. Member_8 stress -4.95 can soften by shorting or changing angle. Load node_3 fixed. Supports fixed nodes_1,2. Node_4 mobility limited to y-direction change mainly—current 3.0m height used. Optimal truss spacing achieved via iterative approach so small adjustments of node_5 around (2.7,1.0) valuable.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Moving node_5 down slightly to say y=0.9 and slightly shifting x 2.65 may better distributions stresses. Reduce member_6 area from \'1\'(0.195) to \'0\'(1) is actually higher area, better to increase or keep, not reduce unless stresses drop. Cross check member length × area to mass constraint.",\n  "reasoning": "Stress vertical force at node_3 (-10 @ -45 deg) acts equally in x & y negative. Truss should transfer load using diagonal members (member_8,5) and vertical (member_6,7). By lowering node_5 y from 1.0 to ~0.9, member_6 force should reduce (less vertical loading). Similarly, member_8 angle more horizontal may reduce tension there. Outer members 1 & 2 remain long but at area_id \'3\' length × area produces manageable stiffness. Check member length and mass for final estimate. Adjust some smaller stressed members to smaller area to reduce weight if possible.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Lengths (approximate):\\nmember_1 (0,0)-(2,0) = 2\\nmember_6 (0,0)-(3.72,3) ~ 4.7\\nmember_5 (2.72,1.0)-(3.72,3) ~ 2.1\\nAdjust node_5 to (2.65,0.9):\\nmember_5 length decreases slightly\\nmember_8 (2.0,0.0) to (2.65,0.9) ~1.22 shortens compared to previous ~1.28\\nCalculate mass and stress effect roughly:",\n  "calculation": "Node_5 new pos: (2.65, 0.90)\\nMember area updates: keep areas mostly same except possibly reduce member_7 area from \'1\'(0.195) to \'0\'(1) to reduce mass (only if stress low enough).
