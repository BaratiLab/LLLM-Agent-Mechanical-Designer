Load at node_3, supports fixed at node_1 and node_2 remain unchanged.",\n\n  "analysis": "High compressive stress in member_1 (-12.3948). Members 5&6 have zero stress; possibly inefficient sizing or placement. Member_3 tensile stress is 8.7932, biggest tension. Goal: Reduce member_1 stress and balance load. Areas appear chosen to control stress. Mass and stress constraints met but room to minimize max stress further by geometry.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on node_5 and node_4 repositioning since they are free nodes. Node_5 near node_3 and node_4 to node_2 line impacts diagonal forces, influence stress. Consider moving node_5 slightly closer toward vertical path between load (node_3) and support (node_2 or node_1). Experiment node_4 changing elevation to redistribute forces; lower height to reduce compression in member_1.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Decreasing height of node_4 may reduce compressive forces on member_1 due to geometry support paths. Bringing node_5 up and slightly right might share load more evenly among members 5,6,7 reducing max stress. Slight increase on members 5,6 area may help redistribute, but should check mass constraint. Member_5 and 6 currently have low stress (0), meaning their geometric role may be optimized.
