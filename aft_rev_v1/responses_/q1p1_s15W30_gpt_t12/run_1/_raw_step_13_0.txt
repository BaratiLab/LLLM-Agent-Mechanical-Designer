Max stress slightly high at 13.78; optimization possible by tuning node_4 and node_5 positions without changing load/support nodes or member layout.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Member_1 is max stressed compressive (-13.78), member_3 max tensile (+10.12). Mass 25.52 well under limit. Reducing stress can be done by redistributing geometry—adjust node_4 and node_5 to reduce stress in longest and high stress members (member_1,3). Members 6 and 5 near zero stress—perfect opportunities for stress redistribution if geometry adjusted. No extra members should be added or removed to retain closed truss, maintaining 7 members as is.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Focus on relocating node_4 down slightly and node_5 slightly right and upward or vice versa to optimize axial forces. node_4 might be reduced in y-coordinate for reduced bending forces. Ensure no intersection or overlap and preserve connections. Fine tune node_5 position to enhance load path between supports and midpoint.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Keeping node_1 and node_2 fixed at supports, node_3 fixed as load node along bottom base, reposition node_4 closer down and node_5 moderately adjusted to optimize internal force distribution. This should reduce stress peaks in highly stressed members while keeping geometry stable. Area assignments keep same for simplicity since they match load capacity with respect to past iterations and mass constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Check geometry distances recalculated for members after node moves, estimate axial stress reduction by narrowing member_1 length or load angle better resolved by geometry change. Longer but straighter members can reduce stress peaks. member_1 length currently approx 3.33; reducing length slightly should lower stress. Length of member_3 also critical due to tensile stress.",\n\n  "calculation": "Move node_4 from (3.6,2.8) to (3.6,2.5) to reduce vertical height and bending influence. Move node_5 from (2.55,0.7) to (2.65,0.75) shifting slightly upward-right for better force path. Validate mass: lengths keep similar; mass ~25.5. Stress estimated drop from 13.78 to ~12, still within constraints.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Structural integrity maintained, no extra members or removal. Stress decreased achievable with modest node shift. Constraints remain satisfied, mass safe below 30.
