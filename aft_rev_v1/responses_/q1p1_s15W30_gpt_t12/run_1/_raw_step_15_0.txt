Constraints: |stress|<=15, mass<=30. Current max stress 15.86 >15; mass 25.05 <30. Need to reduce stress on critical member_1 first.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Current structure on iteration 14 has max stress -15.8564 in member_1 and compressive stress near limit; mass is low around 25. Areas are uniform with member_1,2,3,4 area_id=3 (area=1.759). Member_6 has low area_id=1. Member_5 area=0.782. Structure is mostly optimized on mass but member_1 stress overshoots constraint by 0.86 units.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Increasing area of member_1 to reduce its stress will increase mass slightly but stay below 30. Consider re-routing members to reduce moment on member_1: lowering node_4, adjusting node_5 slightly; use bigger area for member_1 and neighbouring members mainly for load path efficiency.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Move node_4 downward slightly to (3.6, 2.0) to better share load, lower node_5 closer to base at (2.65, 0.55). Increase member_1 area from 3 to 4 (3.128) to reduce stress. Increase member_7 area from 3 to 4 to better support load transfer between node_3 and node_5. Keep other areas mostly same for mass control. Connections untouched to maintain stability.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Member_1 is critical member with highest stress in compression. Increasing cross-section reduces stress: stress ~ force/area. Improving geometry by lowering node_4 reduces bending moment at left edge. Slightly lowering node_5 also redistributes forces, reducing peak stress. Member_7 increased area to help transfer load. This balances stress and mass increase, keeping total below 30 and stresses within limit.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "member_1 length ~ distance node_1 to node_3: sqrt((2.0)^2+0^2)=2.0m, area increase from 1.759 to 3.128 (area id 4). Stress inverse proportional to area. Mass increase estimated: 2.0m*(3.128-1.759)=~2.738, adding to previous total of 25 ~27.7 under 30 limit. Minor disturbances from node moves anticipated to reduce max stress by reducing loads on member_1.",\n  \n  "calculation": "Member_1 length ~2.0 m. Area from 1.759 to 3.128 => stress reducing factor ~1.78x, stress drops from -15.8564 to ~-8.9 approx. Member_7 increase area similarly helps reduce tension there slightly. Node_4 lowered from 2.3 to 2.0 lowers leverage, redistributing internal forces. Total mass roughly 25.0469 + (area increase * length difference) ~27.0. Max expected stress peak under 15. Check member_6 remains at area id 1. Resulting scheme satisfies constraints. No member or node duplicates, loading and supports maintained.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Assert all nodes distinct.
