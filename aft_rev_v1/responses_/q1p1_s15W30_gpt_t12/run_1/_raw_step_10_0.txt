Mass usage is efficient (25.6/30). Focus to minimize max stress (~11.26) further by reducing stress concentration on member_1 (-11.255), member_3 (7.716) and member_6, member_7 with low/zero stress. Reposition node_4 and node_5 slightly upward and outward inside their feasible range to more uniform load distribution.

All members have appropriate cross-section area \'3\', \'2\', \'1\' assigned valid.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Allow slight elevation on node_4 just above current 2.1 (~2.3-2.5) and move node_5 slightly left / lower area around (2.6-2.7, 0.8-1.0) to reduce stress on member_1 and balance triangle shape.

Bring node_5 right balance from previous iterations where lowering it towards 0.7 caused stress above limit at member_6. Consistent cross section area IDs keep mass under 30 limit.
