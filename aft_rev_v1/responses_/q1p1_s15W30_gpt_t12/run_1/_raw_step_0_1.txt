To form a closed truss, add at least one non-collinear node to create triangles. Place node_4 above line to reduce bending and improve load path. Load downward at 45° from node_3 (at x=2). Supports at ends fix moments and shear. Triangulate with proposed node_4 near midline above nodes 2 & 3 for stable design. Use members connecting all nodes to form minimum spanning and stable closed loop (e.g., node_1-node_4, node_2-node_4, node_3-node_4).",\n  \n  "scratch_pad_2": "Introducing node_4 at some y>0 helps form two triangles: node_1-node_3-node_4 and node_3-node_2-node_4.

Focus on minimum member length and choosing smaller area to reduce mass while maintaining stress limits.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Closed truss requires loop (triangles). Nodes 1, 2, 3 collinear can\'t form 2D contained polygon. Add node_4 at x=4, y=3 (above node_2 at 6, node_3 at 2, roughly midpoint). This creates triangles: 1-3-4 and 2-3-4. Members: 1-3, 3-2, 1-4, 2-4, 3-4. Check stresses by treating load vector at node_3 (-10 at -45° relative to x-axis). Approximate member forces using method of joints or basic statics.
