  "preamble": "Optimize node 4 and 5 position to further reduce max stress within constraints.",

  "scratch_pad_1": "Current structure detailed with 5 nodes, 8 members. Load at node_3, supports at nodes 1 & 2 fixed. Max stress 9.17 < 15, mass 28.06 < 30, so constraints met but improvement possible.",

  "analysis": "Stress is below limit but member_1, member_6 have relatively high compressive and tensile stresses (|9.172| and 7.3753) nearing half the allowable 15. Member 8 reduced to |4.3549| from 10+. Node 4 and Node 5 positions changed to (4.1, 3.3) and (2.5, 1.2) spreading nodes outward. Constraint on mass is nearly full, leaving limited scope for increasing cross-section area broadly.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Moving nodes 4 and 5 slightly closer together and slightly lower in vertical direction can reduce stress on long distant members (node1-node4, node4-node2). Also optimize diagonal (node3-node5) length for better force resolution with minimum area 3 to reduce member8 stress.",

  "reasoning": "1) Keep pinned and roller nodes (node_1, node_2) fixed for support. 2) Node 3 fixed at (2.0,0.0) due to load application to maintain load boundary. 3) Adjust nodes 4 and 5 to reduce length of highest stressed members (member_1, member_6). 4) Lower node_4 slightly from 3.3 to around 3.0 and move node_5 inward and downward. 5) Keep member cross sections mostly same or slightly adjusted by area 2 or 3 for balance according to member length changes and force results from last iteration. 6) Use precise float coords below:",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Assuming: mass = sum(length*(area factor from dict)) approx constrained at 30; member length computed from nodal coords Euclidean distance; areas mostly fixed at last known iteration level (mostly '3' except two of '1' and '2'). With node 4 at (4.1, 3.3), node 5 at (2.5, 1.2) max stress 9.17 is OK, adjusting node4 x from 4.1 -> 3.9 and y from 3.3 -> 3.0, node5 x from 2.5 -> 2.6, y from 1.2 -> 1.1 is expected to reduce tensile stress on member_6 and compressive on member_1.",

  "calculation": "node_4 = (3.9, 3.0), node_5 = (2.6, 1.1) \nMember length update:\n- member_1 (node1-node3): unchanged\n- member_6 (node1-node4): length reduced,\n- member_8 (node3-node5): become slightly shorter,\nCalculate total mass remains approximately near 28.0 < 30 with similar areas and slightly shorter members.\nExpected reduction of max stress from 9.17 to hopefully below 8 due to shorter tension/compression elements.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no constraints violation (max stress < 15, total mass < 30), fixed load/support nodes, no duplicate nodes/members, members preserved, areas maintained mostly same. Precision decimals for node placement accurate.",
