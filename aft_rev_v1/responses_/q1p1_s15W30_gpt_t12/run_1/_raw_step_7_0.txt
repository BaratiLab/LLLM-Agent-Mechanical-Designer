Need to reduce stress and possibly mass by structural changes.",\n  "analysis": "Max stress exceeds tensile/compressive limit at member_6 (17.45). Member_6 connects node_1 to node_4 with area 1 (0.195). Current structure has singular highly stressed member. Mass is close to limit but stress necessitates change, either altering member areas or geometry. Node positions near supports unchanged, can move node_4 or 5. Member_6 likely in tension with high stress; redistributing forces via alternative triangulation and modified areas can reduce stress.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Avoid increasing area of member_6 excessively (mass limit), add bracing to reduce its load. Possibly reposition node_4 slightly upwards or sideways for better force path. Also consider increasing area of less stressed members to relieve max stressed member or adding a new node for geometry improvement. Remove member_6 if possible and re-route forces for stress reduction.",\n  "proposal": "Remove or reduce area of member_6, increase area of members forming alternate tension paths node_1-node_5, node_5-node_4. Slightly raise node_4 (y from 3.0 to 3.4) and move node_5 to improve triangle stiffness. Update member areas: member_6 area reduced to \'0\' (1.0), increase member_5 area to \'3\' (1.759), member_3 and member_4 area to \'4\' (3.128) for better force distribution.",\n  "reasoning": "High stress on member_6 suggests load path too concentrated; shortening or changing its geometry not possible as node_1 fixed and member essential. Reducing area less viable since highly stressed; better to shift forces to robust members around node_5 and node_4. Raising node_4 increases its vertical capacity and bracing angles. Increasing cross section in surrounding members helps absorb load, spreading stresses. Mass will increase but stays below 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2), areas chosen from given set, mass = sum of length * area. Target max stress under 15.
