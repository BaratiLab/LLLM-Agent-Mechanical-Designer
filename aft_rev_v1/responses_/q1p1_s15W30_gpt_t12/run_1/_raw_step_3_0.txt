Load at node_3, supports at nodes 1 & 2 fixed. Max stress 9.17 < 15, mass 28.06 < 30, so constraints met but improvement possible.",\n\n  "analysis": "Stress is below limit but member_1, member_6 have relatively high compressive and tensile stresses (|9.172| and 7.3753) nearing half the allowable 15. Member 8 reduced to |4.3549| from 10+. Node 4 and Node 5 positions changed to (4.1, 3.3) and (2.5, 1.2) spreading nodes outward.
