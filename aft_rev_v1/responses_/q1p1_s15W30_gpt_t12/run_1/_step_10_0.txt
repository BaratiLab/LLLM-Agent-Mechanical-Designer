  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss by refining node_4 and node_5 position to reduce max stress within constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress = 11.26 < 15 allowed, total mass = 25.6 < 30 allowed, load at node_3, supports fixed at node_1 and node_2. Current layout has node_4 close to node_2 vertically, causing low stress on members connected to node_4 especially member_6 and member_5.",
  
  "analysis": "Max stress within limits, small safety margin. Mass usage is efficient (25.6/30). Focus to minimize max stress (~11.26) further by reducing stress concentration on member_1 (-11.255), member_3 (7.716) and member_6, member_7 with low/zero stress. Reposition node_4 and node_5 slightly upward and outward inside their feasible range to more uniform load distribution. Maintain node_1, node_2 (support nodes) and node_3 (load node) fixed per constraints. All members have appropriate cross-section area '3', '2', '1' assigned valid.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Allow slight elevation on node_4 just above current 2.1 (~2.3-2.5) and move node_5 slightly left / lower area around (2.6-2.7, 0.8-1.0) to reduce stress on member_1 and balance triangle shape. No duplicate members, closed truss verified.",
  
  "reasoning": "Move node_4 upward stronger diagonals improve force flow, reduces stress peaks. Bring node_5 right balance from previous iterations where lowering it towards 0.7 caused stress above limit at member_6. Consistent cross section area IDs keep mass under 30 limit. Rearrangement should yield lower max stress. Maintain topology, no removal/addition of members. Triangular substructures preferred for stability. Recheck stress and mass time dependent.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Check member lengths for slight changes .\nCalculate approximate length:\nmember_1(new): between (0,0) and (2.7,1.0) unchanged.\nmember_5 & member_6 affected by node_4; moving node_4 to (3.7,2.4) will increase length slightly, likely reduce stress.\nMount area ids same.\nExpect mass similar about 26-27.",
  
  "calculation": "Adjust node_4 y coordinate from 2.1 to 2.4,\nAdjust node_5 y coordinate from 1.0 to 0.85,\nKeep node_5 x at 2.7.\nOther nodes fixed.\nMembers unchanged.\nAreas unchanged.\nEstimate mass will still ≤30 \nbased on previous iterations and length change.\nStress expected max ≤11 continue reduction trend.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Changes maintain support and load condition, no constraint violation detected with proposed moves. Maximizes distribution of forces and reduces stress concentration on member_1 and member_3. Area IDs retained to keep mass efficient.",
