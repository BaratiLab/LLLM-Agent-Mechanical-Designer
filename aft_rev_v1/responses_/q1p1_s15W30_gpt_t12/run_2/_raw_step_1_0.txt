Support node_1 pinned, node_2 roller. Existing nodes: node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4. Current max stress 36.26 > 15, max mass 26.66 ≤30. Area options given. Goal: reduce member stress especially member_2 (-36.26) by redesign or area reallocation and possibly shape optimization.",\n  "analysis": "Member_2 (node_1-node_3) is overstressed compressively (-36.26), well beyond ±15 limit. Member_5 (node_2-node_4) has large area (4) and mass—mass concentrated there facilitates load carrying but still high stress on member_2 suggests geometry or connectivity needs change. Member_3 (node_2-node_3) has zero stress, possibly avoidable or minimal. Existing setup with nodes in a single horizontal line plus a top node creates a poorly supported truss for downward diagonal load at node_3.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "To reduce overstress on node_1-node_3 member, add new node above node_3 to better redistribute force, forming a triangular configuration allowing load path from node_3 through new node up to nodes 1 and/or 2. Avoid adding mass excessively by adjusting areas of highly stressed members to stronger sections, reducing sections where stress low. Possibly remove or reduce member_5 area which is heavy. Use another diagonal member and best cross bracing.",\n  "proposal": "Add a new node above node_3 at (2.0, 3.0). Connect this node_5 to node_3, node_4, node_1, and node_2. Remove member_3 (node_2-node_3) since it\'s zero stress and redundant. Increase critical member_2 area to 3 (≥0.782), reduce member_5 area from 4 to 2 or 1 to reduce mass. Adjust areas for optimal stresses allowing reduced and balanced member stresses. This creates multiple load path and reduces moment demand on member_2.",\n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 (2,3) creates better triangulation and intersects load forces so member_2 isn\'t so heavily loaded. Connecting node_5 to node_4 sustains top compression forces, connecting to node_1 and node_2 redistributes forces better. Removing low stress members avoids redundancy reducing mass. Area increase in critical members to handle higher compression balanced with reducing large areas with low stress (like member_5) to keep mass under 30. Expected lower max stress under 15 and total mass under 30.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Calculate new member lengths and areas to estimate mass, stress distributions. Member lengths: node_1-node_3 ~2m, node_3-node_5 ~3m, node_5-node_1 ~3.6m, node_5-node_4 ~1m, node_5-node_2 ~4m, node_4-node_2 ~ (keep but reduce area). Priority areas per member accordingly to keep stresses ≤15. Estimate mass sum(length*area) ≤30. Expected mass: members ~2-4 areas, length between 1-4m makes mass feasible.",\n  "calculation": "Mass estimate: length*area. For example, member_2: length ~2m area 3 → mass=6. Member_5 length ~4.47 area 2 → mass=8.94. Others adjusted less for total, sum under 30.
