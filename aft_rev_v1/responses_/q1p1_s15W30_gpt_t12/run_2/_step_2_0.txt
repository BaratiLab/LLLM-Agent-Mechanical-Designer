  "preamble": "Structure satisfies all constraints with minimal stress and mass near limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Max stress 13.69 < 15 allowed, mass 28.5254 < 30 constraint. Load and support nodes fixed.",
  
  "analysis": "Current iteration 1 structure has achieved acceptable max stress and mass within constraints. Stress distribution across members is quite balanced with no member overstressed. Node_5 introduced helped by redistributing forces and reducing max stress from prior 36.26 to current 13.69. Members mainly in area group 2-3 cover needed capacity.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Further improvement potential limited as max stress close to threshold and mass near limit. Node repositioning of free nodes constrained tightly by load and supports. Additional subdivisions or larger areas increase mass above limit.",
  
  "reasoning": "Design efficiently reduced max stress by introducing node_5 and multiple inclined members. Efforts to optimize the nodal coordinates of node_5 show proximity near node_4 and node_3 allowing balanced force paths. Members area selections from mid-range available areas keep mass reasonable. The distribution of stresses indicate a structurally stable closed truss. Reducing member areas or removing members risks increase of max stress above 15. Similarly, relocating free nodes beyond small moves risks instability or failing constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Stress constraint: -15 <= max_stress <= 15; Mass <=30. Existing max stress 13.69 under limit. Mass summation close to limit but compliant. Node_3, node_1, node_2 fixed. Free nodes largely settled to effective layout. Continued minimal moves have diminishing returns.",
  
  "calculation": "Member stresses as per FEM from previous step tightly controlled: max |13.69|. Increasing cross sections tends to increase mass > 30. Reducing cross section increases stress > 15. Moving free node_5 from (2,3) deviates mass balance and simultaneously can lead to higher stress from force paths. Given these observations, minimal room for improvement without violating constraints or enforced positions.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Constraints satisfied; current design is mature and well balanced. Stop optimization to avoid overfitting or constraint violation.",
