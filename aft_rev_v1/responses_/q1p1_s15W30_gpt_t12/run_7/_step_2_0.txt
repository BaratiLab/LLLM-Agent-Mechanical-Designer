  "preamble": "Current 5-node truss meets constraints with max stress and mass well within limits.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Objective to minimize stress max |10.05| < 15 with total mass 19.66 < 30, maintaining closed structure with fixed load/support nodes.",

  "analysis": "FEM shows low stress maximum at ±10 MPa, well below ±15 limit. Mass is 19.66 < 30 max. Member areas mostly moderate (2 or 3). Some members have zero stress (members 4 and 7). Distribution of stress reduced significantly from previous iteration where max stress was 52 MPa. Node 5 added to distribute force better. Members from load node (3) and node 5 have reduced stress compared to iteration 0. Structure is closed and stable with two supports node_1 pinned, node_2 roller, and load on node_3 fixed." ,
  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress evenly distributed; small stress margins bracket design safety. The closed truss is balanced geometrically and statically. No single member highly stressed; some unused members may remove redundancy but could reduce robustness.",

  "reasoning": "To reduce stress further, trials would involve optimizing node_5 position vertically or horizontally to help further distribute loads, or adjusting member areas. But stress is already low and mass is significantly under max mass (30). Given the constraints, moving node_5 beyond 1.5 may harm geometry or increase stress in other members. Reducing cross sections could reduce mass but there's risk member stress might rise. Members with zero stress could be removed, but that risks structural stability under variable loads. The current layout has good symmetry and force paths distributed, minimizing bending and shear. Hence, structure is close to optimal for the applied load and boundary conditions.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Current max_stress = 10.05 < 15, total_mass = 19.663 < 30. Members member_4 and member_7 parts no stress, but structure could be less stable if removed. Elevating or lowering node_5 would unbalance forces on members 3,5,6. Areas 2 or 3 already minimal for given stresses. Moving node_5 slightly to spread force may help min stress but risk increase in mass or complexity. Given slack in constraints, small improvements unlikely to justify change without iteration beyond 25 steps.",

  "calculation": "Current stress margin = 15 - 10.05 = 4.95 MPa, moderate buffer. Mass margin = 30 - 19.66 = 10.34, indicating possibility for alternative designs with larger members or more nodes, but not needed. Based on iterations, current optimized design distributes stress efficiently. No moves of load or support nodes allowed. Node_5 midpoint position vertical is best balance. Members with zero stress suggest possible topology change but might degrade reliability. Changing connection or areas likely move stress outside constraints or raise mass. Further optimization would show diminishing returns.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Constraints met: max_stress ≤ ±15, mass ≤ 30. Current geometry stable closed truss with sensible areas and no overloaded members. Unused members provide reserves for variable or dynamic loading consideration. Recommended to stop iteration here.",
