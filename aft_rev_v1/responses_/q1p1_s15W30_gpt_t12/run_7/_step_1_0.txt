  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss to satisfy stress ±15 and mass ≤30 constraints.",
  
  "scratch_pad_1": "Loaded node_3 downward-left force, support at nodes 1 (pinned) and 2 (roller). Current mass 19.63 <30, stress up to ~52 >15 limit, tensile/compressive violation on members 1 and 3 particularly. Member areas currently continuous from 0.195 to 3.128 etc.",

  "analysis": "Current truss over-stressed mainly in member_1 (-52.38) and member_3 (-36.26), indicating these bars are bearing excessive loads compressively. Member_2 and member_5 have larger areas (3 and 3) but low stress; suggests material use imbalance. High stress concentration at node_3 due to load and poor force distribution. Structure is a simple trapezoid shape with all nodes fixed, negligible internal freedom to redistribute load. Need to reduce force concentration by adding nodes/members or redesign the triangulation pattern without changing support/load nodes.",

  "scratch_pad_2": "Strategy to add intermediate node(s) vertically aligned or staggered to node_3 to increase structural redundancy and alternative load paths. Possibly reposition node_4 or add node near node_4 helps. Aim to decompose load force to multiple members sharing smaller forces, so member stresses reduce under ±15 limits. Also optimize areas: increase area for high stress members, minimize unnecessary large areas. Check member lengths impact mass.",

  "proposal": "Add a new node (node_5) vertically above node_3 to distribute load. Redefine members: connect node_3 to node_5, node_5 to node_4, node_1 to node_5, node_2 to node_5, freeing some load from overloaded members. Use lower areas (1 or 2) on shorter members, increased areas selectively complying stress bounds. Keep existing supports node_1 and node_2. Keep node_3 at same place; node_5 placed approx at (2.0, 1.5). Redesign members: existing members can be adjusted, minimize use of large-area members.",

  "reasoning": "Current community of members concentrating load on nodes 1, 3 and 4 leads to unbalanced stress distribution. Adding node_5 at mid-height balances the load flow, creates more stable triangle substructures—1-3-5, 2-3-5, 5-4 — avoiding direct high loading in member_1 and member_3. Areas chosen to comply stress, utilize smaller areas for lower stress members, larger for critical compression members but capped by max stress cutoff ±15. Mass estimated keeping member length and area product sum <30.",

  "scratch_pad_3": "Member lengths roughly recalculated: base spans between nodes 1 and 2 is 6.0, height approx 3.0 split by node_5 at 1.5. Members: node_1-node_3 (2m), node_3-node_5 (1.5m), node_5-node_4 (~1.5m), node_1-node_5 (sqrt(2^2+1.5^2)=2.5m), node_2-node_5 (approx sqrt(4^2+1.5^2)=4.27m), node_2-node_4 (approx sqrt(4^2+3^2)=5.0m). Area ID assigned considering lengths and desired stress ≤15 limit.",

  "calculation": "Estimate member forces reduction approximated by subdividing compression on member_1 and 3 by half via node_5. Assign areas for high stress bars member_1 and member_3 from 1 (0.195) to 3 (1.759), total mass estimated <30 is feasible. Member_2 and member_5 can reduce areas from 3 to 2 (0.782) to reduce excess mass. Check sum(length*area) ~ 2*1.76 + 1.5*1.76 + 1.5*0.78 + 2.5*0.78 + 4.27*0.78 + 5.0*0.78 ≈ (3.52+2.64+1.17+1.94+3.33+3.9)=16.5 which is <19.6 original total mass and <30 limit. Check max stress: compressed bars halved force → ~26 max → areas scale → stress reduces under 15 allowed.",

  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify nodes fixed: node_1 and node_2 not moved (support). Load node_3 fixed. Added node_5 inside truss vertical line at (2.0, 1.5). Avoid duplicate members or nodes. Member_1 to node_3 area raised to manage stresses. Member areas balanced. Should meet stress and mass constraints.",
