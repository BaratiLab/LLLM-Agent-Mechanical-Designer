    "preamble": "Optimize a closed 2D truss on given nodes under load supporting constraints max stress ±15 and mass ≤ 30.",
    
    "scratch_pad_1": "Given nodes: node_1(0,0) pinned, node_2(6,0) roller, node_3(2,0) with downward-left load (-10, -45°). No changes to node positions allowed. Need closed truss, select members connecting nodes plus possibly adding nodes to create stable triangulation and meet stress/mass limits.",
    
    "analysis": "The stuck initial nodes lie all on x-axis, which cannot form a stable in-plane truss alone providing resistance in vertical direction. Need to add at least one node above, to form triangles. A single added node above node_3 say at (2.0, 3.0) makes a triangular prism domed structure (or simple truss) forming stable closed loop node_1-node_3-(added_node)-node_2-node_1. This addition enables member orientation to counter vertical+oblique loads, minimizing stress. Members formed will connect: node_1-node_3, node_3-node_2, node_1-(added node), node_2-(added node), node_3-(added node) to enclose structure. Will size members based on length and expected forces to not exceed stress ±15 and limit total mass under 30. Areas chosen from given discrete set. Need simple truss stress calculation using equilibrium, assuming axial members only. Assume linear elastic members, no buckling check but small areas favored to limit mass.",
    
    "scratch_pad_2": "Node additions from instructions unclear but not forbidden - allowed if helps close truss. Close truss means all nodes mutually linked to avoid mechanism. 4 node structure plausible. Member lengths approx by Euclidean distance. Stress via force/members area Approx. Member 1-3: length 2m, 3-(added_node): length approx 3m, added-node connections to supports: lengths approx calculated. Mass sum of lengths × area to be ≤30. Member force approx from simple force balance under load magnitude 10N at node_3 at 45°, requiring compression/tension that can be balanced in members. Given area discrete, target small to moderate areas for lower mass. Use stress limit = force/area; area≥force/15 to keep stress under limits.",
    
    "reasoning": "Add node_4 at (2.0,3.0) to form stable triangle structure. Connect all nodes to form closed loop of members. Member areas chosen for length and expected force to maintain stress within ±15. Assuming force distribution roughly splitting load at node_3 among three members connected to it (node_1-3, node_3-2, node_3-4). Easily partition 10N load among length and area keeping stresses within limits. Total mass is sum length * area and can't exceed 30. Set small areas for shorter members and slightly larger for longer members carrying bigger forces. Members connecting supports can have moderate area since distances higher. Stress = force / (area × cross-section unit?), assuming unit cross-sectional calculations, direct pressure <±15. Approximations accept reasonability for 1st iteration.",
    
    "scratch_pad_3": "Force at node_3: magnitude 10N at -45°. Decompose to Fx= -10*cos(45°) ~ -7.07 N (left), Fy= -10*sin(45°) ~ -7.07 N (down). Members at node_3: 1-3, 2-3, 3-4 approx share force. Neither member 1-2 printed directly connected, triangle formation needs 1-4, 2-4,3-4 connections plus 1-3,2-3 bridged. Select member areas from available options.",
