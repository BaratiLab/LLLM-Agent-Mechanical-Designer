Current mass 19.63 <30, stress up to ~52 >15 limit, tensile/compressive violation on members 1 and 3 particularly. Member areas currently continuous from 0.195 to 3.128 etc.",\n\n  "analysis": "Current truss over-stressed mainly in member_1 (-52.38) and member_3 (-36.26), indicating these bars are bearing excessive loads compressively. Member_2 and member_5 have larger areas (3 and 3) but low stress; suggests material use imbalance. High stress concentration at node_3 due to load and poor force distribution. Structure is a simple trapezoid shape with all nodes fixed, negligible internal freedom to redistribute load. Need to reduce force concentration by adding nodes/members or redesign the triangulation pattern without changing support/load nodes.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Strategy to add intermediate node(s) vertically aligned or staggered to node_3 to increase structural redundancy and alternative load paths. Possibly reposition node_4 or add node near node_4 helps. Aim to decompose load force to multiple members sharing smaller forces, so member stresses reduce under ±15 limits. Also optimize areas: increase area for high stress members, minimize unnecessary large areas. Check member lengths impact mass.",\n\n  "proposal": "Add a new node (node_5) vertically above node_3 to distribute load. Redefine members: connect node_3 to node_5, node_5 to node_4, node_1 to node_5, node_2 to node_5, freeing some load from overloaded members. Use lower areas (1 or 2) on shorter members, increased areas selectively complying stress bounds. Keep existing supports node_1 and node_2. Keep node_3 at same place; node_5 placed approx at (2.0, 1.5). Redesign members: existing members can be adjusted, minimize use of large-area members.",\n\n  "reasoning": "Current community of members concentrating load on nodes 1, 3 and 4 leads to unbalanced stress distribution. Adding node_5 at mid-height balances the load flow, creates more stable triangle substructures—1-3-5, 2-3-5, 5-4 — avoiding direct high loading in member_1 and member_3. Areas chosen to comply stress, utilize smaller areas for lower stress members, larger for critical compression members but capped by max stress cutoff ±15.

Area ID assigned considering lengths and desired stress ≤15 limit.",\n\n  "calculation": "Estimate member forces reduction approximated by subdividing compression on member_1 and 3 by half via node_5. Assign areas for high stress bars member_1 and member_3 from 1 (0.195) to 3 (1.759), total mass estimated <30 is feasible. Member_2 and member_5 can reduce areas from 3 to 2 (0.782) to reduce excess mass. Check sum(length*area) ~ 2*1.76 + 1.5*1.76 + 1.5*0.78 + 2.5*0.78 + 4.27*0.78 + 5.0*0.78 ≈ (3.52+2.64+1.17+1.94+3.33+3.9)=16.5 which is <19.6 original total mass and <30 limit. Check max stress: compressed bars halved force → ~26 max → areas scale → stress reduces under 15 allowed.",\n\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify nodes fixed: node_1 and node_2 not moved (support).
