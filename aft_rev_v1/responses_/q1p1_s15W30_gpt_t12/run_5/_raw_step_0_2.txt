To form closed truss, add a new node above load node_3 to create a triangle, improving load distribution. Named node_4 as (2.0, 3.0) chosen to help share load vertically and both compression/tension. Connect members: node_1-node_4, node_4-node_2, node_3-node_1, node_3-node_2, node_3-node_4. This configuration produces a triangular shape with diagonals for stability and load paths.
