  "preamble": "Optimize 2D truss for given load/supports with stress ≤15 and mass ≤30.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Load at node_3 (-10 N at -45°), pinned at node_1, roller at node_2. Aim to reduce high stresses in members 1 and 2 (currently -52 and -16), redistribute load, maintain total mass under 30.",
  
  "analysis": "Original structure has short horizontal members between supports and load node. High compressive stress in member_1 (-52) and excessive tensile stress in member_5 (20). Possible stress concentration on members connected directly to load node. Mass is acceptable but stress limits violated.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress limits suggest redesign of tension/compression paths. Consider adding a new upper node between node_3 and node_4 at an optimized vertical position for better load transfer. Using larger area for critical members and smaller for others can help.",
  
  "proposal": "Add an intermediate node (node_5) above node_3 to form an additional load path. Move node_4 slightly right for better triangular bracing. Redefine members for enhanced stability and stress reduction. Increase areas of members directly under load.",
  
  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 at (2.0, 4.0) forms secondary load path which reduces load on member_1 and member_2. Extending node_4 horizontally to x=3.0 will lengthen compression path, reducing stresses. Members between load node_3 and node_5 carry main load in compression/tension arms. Appropriately sizing areas ensures stresses reduce below limit with mass constraint.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculations, estimated stresses decrease from using triangle geometry. Area allocation: Critical load carriers — member 1, 2 → area '3' (1.759). Triangulating members node_3-5 and node_5-4 get areas '2'(0.782) or '3'(1.759). Less loaded members kept at smaller area '1'(0.195).",
  
  "calculation": "Node additions:\nnode_5 = (2.0, 4.0)\nnode_4 moved from (2.0,3.0) to (3.0,3.0)\n\nMembers:\nmember_1: node_1 - node_3, area '3'\nmember_2: node_3 - node_2, area '3'\nmember_3: node_3 - node_5, area '2'\nmember_4: node_5 - node_4, area '2'\nmember_5: node_1 - node_4, area '1'\nmember_6: node_2 - node_4, area '1'\nmember_7: node_5 - node_3 (already existing as member_3), kept as above\n\nApproximate lengths and mass remain well under 30, expected max stresses below 15 with larger areas on primary tension/compression members.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no members exceed ±15 stress, mass way below 30. Node_5 addition improves stiffness; node_4 reposition optimizes load triangle. No duplicates in nodes or members. Load/support nodes unchanged per constraints. Areas picked from approved set.",
