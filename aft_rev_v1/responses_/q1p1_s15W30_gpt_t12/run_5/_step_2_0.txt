  "preamble": "Optimization at iteration 1 meets stress and mass constraints with balanced design.",
  "scratch_pad_1": "Current max stress 7.06 is well below Â±15 limit; total mass 16.44 < 30 max allowed. Load is at node_3 with fixed supports at node_1 and node_2. Nodes 4 and 5 above baseline provide stable triangular support.",
  "analysis": "Stress is evenly distributed with no member overstressed; cross-section areas reasonably sized per load paths. Node positions comply with fixed load/support constraints and ensure a closed truss. Internal nodes elevated providing good force paths minimizing bending and shear in members.",
  "scratch_pad_2": "Attempt to move upper nodes further or reduce areas risks mass increase or stress redistribution pushing towards limits. Current design exhibits low stress magnitudes and good topology, indicating near-optimality.",
  "reasoning": "Further nodal adjustments likely marginal or could degrade load path efficiency or increase member lengths and thus mass. Cross-section areas aligned with stress levels ensure lighter yet safe structure. Closed truss shape maintained. Total mass well below limit offers safety margin. Maximum stress is well within allowable Reduce or relocate members unlikely to yield significant improvement considering constraints.",
  "scratch_pad_3": "Max stress: 7.06 < 15 limits. Mass:16.44 < 30 max. Areas used largest at highly stressed members (area 3:1.759; area 2:0.782; area 1:0.195). Nodes at fixed/load constrained positions by problem's requirement. Node_4 and node_5 placements effective at load transfer point node_3. Previous iteration with fewer nodes showed stress >50; new iteration highly improved.",
  "calculation": "No further optimization calculated due to low stresses, acceptable mass, fixed constraints on load/support nodes. Small change in node_4 and node_5 positions unadvised given current optimality. FEM results and member areas distribution balanced.",
  "scratch_pad_final": "All constraints satisfied strictly. Closed truss maintained. Practical engineering judgment confirms further adjustments unlikely to reduce max stress without exceeding other constraints or moving load/support nodes.",
