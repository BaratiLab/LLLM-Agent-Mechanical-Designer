Aim to reduce high stresses in members 1 and 2 (currently -52 and -16), redistribute load, maintain total mass under 30.",\n  \n  "analysis": "Original structure has short horizontal members between supports and load node. High compressive stress in member_1 (-52) and excessive tensile stress in member_5 (20). Possible stress concentration on members connected directly to load node. Mass is acceptable but stress limits violated.",\n  "scratch_pad_2": "Stress limits suggest redesign of tension/compression paths. Consider adding a new upper node between node_3 and node_4 at an optimized vertical position for better load transfer. Using larger area for critical members and smaller for others can help.",\n  \n  "proposal": "Add an intermediate node (node_5) above node_3 to form an additional load path. Move node_4 slightly right for better triangular bracing. Redefine members for enhanced stability and stress reduction. Increase areas of members directly under load.",\n  \n  "reasoning": "Adding node_5 at (2.0, 4.0) forms secondary load path which reduces load on member_1 and member_2. Extending node_4 horizontally to x=3.0 will lengthen compression path, reducing stresses. Members between load node_3 and node_5 carry main load in compression/tension arms. Appropriately sizing areas ensures stresses reduce below limit with mass constraint.",\n  "scratch_pad_3": "Member length calculations, estimated stresses decrease from using triangle geometry. Area allocation: Critical load carriers — member 1, 2 → area \'3\' (1.759). Triangulating members node_3-5 and node_5-4 get areas \'2\'(0.782) or \'3\'(1.759). Less loaded members kept at smaller area \'1\'(0.195).",\n  \n  "calculation": "Node additions:\\nnode_5 = (2.0, 4.0)\\nnode_4 moved from (2.0,3.0) to (3.0,3.0)\\n\\nMembers:\\nmember_1: node_1 - node_3, area \'3\'\\nmember_2: node_3 - node_2, area \'3\'\\nmember_3: node_3 - node_5, area \'2\'\\nmember_4: node_5 - node_4, area \'2\'\\nmember_5: node_1 - node_4, area \'1\'\\nmember_6: node_2 - node_4, area \'1\'\\nmember_7: node_5 - node_3 (already existing as member_3), kept as above\\n\\nApproximate lengths and mass remain well under 30, expected max stresses below 15 with larger areas on primary tension/compression members.",\n  "scratch_pad_final": "Verify no members exceed ±15 stress, mass way below 30.
